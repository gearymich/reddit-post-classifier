Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

AskReddit,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,"As the gap of the political divide in our world grows deeper, we would like to take a few minutes of your time or express our support of equal treatment, equal justice, to express solidarity with groups which have been marginalized for too long, and to outright say black lives matter. The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**

AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.

This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.

With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.

We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.

AskReddit,How do you feel about ’how would you feel?’ posts being banned?,"We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.
* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

With love,

We have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:

[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)

[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)

We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.

Additionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored.""

If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)

OutOfTheLoop,"Why was /r/IAmA, along with a number of other large subreddits, made private?","###TL;DR /r/IAmA, /r/AskReddit, /r/funny, /r/Books, /r/science, /r/Music, /r/gaming, /r/history, /r/Art, /r/videos, /r/gadgets, /r/todayilearned, /r/Documentaries, /r/LifeProTips, /r/Jokes, /r/pics, /r/Dataisbeautiful and /r/movies have all made themselves private in response to the removal of an administrator key to the AMA process, /u/chooter, but also due to underlying resentment against the admins for running the site poorly - being uncommunicative, and disregarding the thousands of moderators who keep the site running. In addition, /r/listentothis has [disabled all submissions](/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/), and [so has /r/pics](/r/pics/comments/3by69q/due_to_recent_events_rpics_will_not_be_allowing/). /r/Jokes has [announced its support](/r/Jokes/comments/3bxqro/statement_from_the_moderates_regarding_the/) (~~but has not gone private~~ and has also gone private). Major subreddits, including /r/4chan, /r/circlejerk and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, have also expressed solidarity through going private. [See here for a further list](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/).

***

###What happened?

At approximately 5pm UTC, 1pm EST, on Thursday the 2^nd of July, 2015, the moderators of /r/IAmA took their subreddit, which is one of the default set, private. This means that only a very small number of people (consisting of the moderators of /r/IAmA, as well as any pre-approved users) could view and post to the subreddit, making it for all intents and purposes shut down; any other redditors would just see [this page](http://i.imgur.com/DX4S7VF.png). Just after that, a [thread was posted to this subreddit](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/), asking whether anyone knew why it had happened. /u/karmanaut, top mod of /r/IAmA, responded with [an explanation of why they took the subreddit private](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d).


### Why was /r/IAmA made private, then?

The situation was explained [here](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d) by /u/karmanaut: the mods of /r/IAmA had just found out that without prior warning, /u/chooter, or Victoria, had been released from her position at reddit. They felt that they, along with the other subreddits that host AMAs, should have been warned beforehand, if only so that they could have someone or something in place to handle the transition. /u/karmanaut went on to say that many of the mods affected by this do not believe that the admins understand how heavily /u/chooter was relied upon to allow AMAs to go smoothly - something which is outlined below.  Without her, they found themselves in a difficult situation, which is exemplifed by what happened today:

> We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry. She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does. 

As a result of this, the mods therefore took /r/IAmA private, stating their reasoning as follows:

>  for /r/IAMA to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work

> we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.

###Who is /u/chooter, and why was she so important to the functioning of IAmA?

/u/chooter(/about/team#user/chooter), featured [in our wiki](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions#wiki_who_is_victoria.3F_why_is_she_mentioned_in_so_many_amas.3F) is [Victoria Taylor](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-victoria-taylor-ethan-hawke-ama/), who was, until today, Director of Talent at reddit. However, her essential role was to act as liaison between reddit, IAmA, and any members of the public that wanted to do AMAs; she therefore helped to set up AMAs with celebrities, and, if they were not too familiar with computers (like Bill Murray), she may help them out, both over the phone and in person.



**Links of interest:** 

* [reddit blog post announcing her hire](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/welcome-new-recruit-victoria-keeper-of.html)

* [Victoria's AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/) ([cached](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bjPOP7ZaVd0J:https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa+&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gl=rs))

Victoria was important to AMAs for a number of major reasons: firstly, she provided concrete proof of the identity of a celebrity doing an AMA, and made sure that it was not a second party purporting to be the celebrity; she was also a direct line of contact to the admins, allowing the moderators of AMA to quickly resolve an issue encountered during an AMA (the consequences of the absence of which were [bad](/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/cftfbio) - ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UtV7fvg.png)). Victoria also was the channel for the scheduling of AMAs by third parties, and she would ensure both that an AMA was up to scratch before it was posted, and that the person doing the AMA understood exactly what it entailed. Without her, the mods of /r/IAmA say that they will be overwhelmed, and that they may even need to limit AMAs.

###Why did she leave reddit so abruptly?

The short answer: no-one, excluding a select few of the administrative team, knows precisely why /u/chooter was removed as an admin, and that will almost certainly continue to be the case until the admins get their house in order: both parties are at being professional in that they aren't talking about the reasons why it occurred.

###What have the reactions across the rest of reddit been?

So far, **/r/AskReddit, /r/funny, /r/Books, /r/science, /r/Music, /r/gaming, /r/history, /r/Art, /r/videos, /r/gadgets, /r/todayilearned, /r/Documentaries, /r/LifeProTips, /r/jokes, /r/pics, /r/Dataisbeautiful, and /r/movies have followed /r/IAmA in making themselves private**. In addition, /r/listentothis has [disabled all submissions](/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/), and [so has /r/pics](/r/pics/comments/3by69q/due_to_recent_events_rpics_will_not_be_allowing/)and /r/Jokes has [announced its support](/r/Jokes/comments/3bxqro/statement_from_the_moderates_regarding_the/) (but has not gone private). Major subreddits, including /r/4chan, /r/circlejerk and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, have also expressed solidarity through going private. [See here for a further list](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/).

Many other subreddits were also reliant on /u/chooter's services as an official contact point for the organisation of AMAs on reddit, including /r/science, /r/books, and /r/Music. So, in order to express their dissatisfaction with the difficulties they have been placed in without /u/chooter, similar to /r/IAmA, they have made themselves private. 

/u/nallen, lead mod of /r/science, explained that subreddit's reasoning in this way:

> To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs; Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be ""Sorry, I can't help.""  

> Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. 

In turn, /u/imakuram, /r/books moderator, had this to say:

> This seems to be a seriously stupid decision. We have several AMAs upcoming in /r/books and have no idea how to contact the authors.

/r/AskReddit's message expressed a similar sentiment:

> As a statment on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, /r/AskReddit has decided to go private for the time being. Please see [this post](/r/IdeasForAskreddit/comments/3bxj7n/megathread_subreddit_shutdown/) in /r/ideasforaskreddit for more discussion.

/r/Books took [the decision as a community to go dark](https://archive.is/DVzu8).

/r/todayilearned posted this statement:

> The way the admins failed to communicate with AMA's mods and left them without a way to contact the people that were going to do them illustrates the disconnect between admins and the moderators they depend on. It showed disrespect for the people with planned amas, the moderators, and the users. A little communication can go a long way.   There's so much more than that, but one thing at a time.

Much of the *metasphere*, a term for the parts of reddit that focus on the content produced by reddit itself, has also reacted to these happenings, with threads from [/r/SubredditDrama](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/) and [/r/Drama](/r/Drama/comments/3bw66c/admin_chooter_aka_victoria_has_been_let_go_from/), as well as the (currently private) subreddit /r/circlejerk, which parodies and satirises reddit, adding a message to [make fun of the action](https://i.imgur.com/1lsMqw0.png).

###Why is this all happening so suddenly? 

As much as Victoria is loved, this reaction is not all a result of her departure: there is a feeling among many of the moderators of reddit that the admins do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits, which they feel is expressed by, among other things, the lack of communication between them and the admins, and their disregard of the thousands of mods who keep reddit's communities going. /u/nallen's response above is an example of one of the many responses to these issues. 

The moderation tools on reddit are another of the larger contention points between the mods and admins - they are frequently saidby those who use them often to be a decade out of date. /u/creesch, one of the creators of the /r/toolbox extension, an extension which attempts to fill much of the gap left in those moderator tools, said this:

> This is a non answer and a great example of reddit as a company not being in touch with the actually website anymore. ... When a majority of the people that run your site rely on a third party extension [/r/toolbox] something is clearly wrong. ...

> Another great example of how much reddit cares about their assets is reddit companion. Which at the time of writing has around [154,302 installations, is utterly broken and hasn't been updated since February 21, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sdMda6p.png), the most ridiculous thing? It isn't hard to fix [people tried to do the work for reddit since it is open source but they simply have been ignoring those pull requests since 2013](https://github.com/reddit/reddit-companion/pulls). 

> And honestly, I get that they might not have resources for a silly extension. But the fact that they keep it around on the chrome store while it is utterly broken and only recently removed it from the reddit footer baffles me. I think I messaged them about them about a year ago, it took them another year to actually update the footer with apps and tools they are (still) working on. 

/u/K_Lobstah, another moderator, also expressed frustration earlier today in [a submission to /r/self](/r/self/comments/3bvkf0/stop_throwing_beer_cans_on_my_lawn_while_im/) over the lack of responses from the admins concerning the issue of the new search UI, which has been strongly disliked by redditors in [the /r/changelog post](/r/changelog/comments/3bsm11/reddit_change_new_search_results_page/).

> Stop throwing beer cans on our lawns while we try to mow them. Use /r/beta[1] as a Beta; listen to the feedback. Fix the things that need fixing, give us the tools we need to do even the simplest of tasks, like reading messages from subscribers.

> Stop relying on volunteers and third-parties to build the most important and useful tools for moderating this site.

> Help us help you.

###What's happening now?

/u/kn0thing has provided a response from the admins [here](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp):

> We don't talk about specific employees, but I do want you to know that I'm here to triage AMA requests in the interim. All AMA inquiries go to AMA@reddit.com where we have a team in place.
    
> I posted this on [a mod sub] but I'm reposting here:
    
> We get that losing Victoria has a significant impact on the way you manage your community. I'd really like to understand how we can help solve these problems, because I know r/IAMA thrived before her and will thrive after.
    
> We're prepared to help coordinate and schedule AMAs. I've got the inbound coming through my inbox right now and many of the people who come on to do AMAs are excited to do them without assistance (most recently, the noteworthy Channing Tatum AMA).

The moderators of an increasing number of default subreddits have been making them private, in an attempt to draw the admins' attention to how they have been mismanaging the site with a substantive demonstrative act - since for many years, they've been trying to get the admins to listen normally with relatively little improvement.

**Update:** the admins [seem to have replied to some of the mods' concerns](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bytne/the_admins_have_broken_the_silence_with_posts_to/), and some subreddits, such as /r/pics, are content with that, and so have returned themselves to being public (although there were [manufactured](/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c09rj/the_paopics_screenshots_arent_real/) rumours that there was administrative impetus behind its return). However, others have seen these promises from the admins as more of the same sorts of unfulfilled promises that helped create the unstable situation that brought this affair about.

/r/science also made itself public again, in order to avoid interfering with plans for an AMA with the Lancet Comission at 1pm EST, July 3rd, on ""Climate Impacts on Health, and What To Do About It"".

Victoria was beloved by many redditors, and people are understandably upset - but remember that we still don't know why it happened. What is an issue is how this problem for the admins was handled; whether or not it was an emergency for the admins, the IAmA mod team were not given warning, and weren't informed of the alternative contact location early enough, which gave them a sizeable logistical problem - one which they took themselves private to deal with.",learning

OutOfTheLoop,What’s going on with conservative parents warning their children of “something big” coming soon?,"What do our parents who listen to conservative media believe is going to happen in the coming weeks?

Today, my mother put in our family group text, “God bless all!!!  Stay close to the Lord these next few weeks, something big is coming!!!”

I see in r/insaneparents that there seems to be a whole slew of conservative parents giving ominous warnings of big events coming soon, a big change, so be safe and have cash and food stocked up. Example: https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/kxg9mv/i_was_raised_in_a_doomsday_cult_my_mom_says_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I understand that it’s connected to Trump politics and some conspiracies, but how deep does it go?

I’m realizing that my mother is much more extreme than she initially let on the past couple years, and it’s actually making me anxious.

What are the possibilities they believe in and how did they get led to these beliefs?

Edit: well this got a lot of attention while I was asleep! I do agree that this is similar to some general “end times” talk that I’ve heard before from some Christian conservatives whenever a Democratic is elected. However, this seems to be something much more. I also see similar statements of parents not actually answering when asked about it, that’s definitely the case here. Just vague language comes when questioned, which I imagine is purposeful, so that it can be attached to almost anything that might happen.

Edit2: certainly didn’t expect this to end up on the main page! I won’t ever catch up, but the supportive words are appreciated! I was simply looking for some insight into an area of the internet I try to stay detached from, but realized I need to be a bit more aware of it. Thanks to all who have given a variety of responses based on actual right-wing websites or their own experiences. I certainly don’t think that there is anything “big” coming. I was once a more conspiracy-minded person, but have realized over the years that most big, wild conspiracy theories are really just distractions from the day-to-day injustices of the world. However, given recent events, my own mother’s engagement with these theories makes me anxious about the possibility of more actions similar to the attack on the Capitol. Again, I’m unsure of  which theory she subscribes to, but as someone who left the small town I was raised in for a city, 15 years ago, I am beginning to realize just how vast a difference there is present in the information and misinformation that spreads in different types of communities.",learning

**It was initially  reported that /r/transfags had been banned in the first sweep.  That subreddit has subsequently also been banned, but /r/trans_fags was the first to be banned for specific targeted harassment.*

The allegations are that users from /r/fatpeoplehate were regularly going outside their subreddit and harassing people in other subreddits or even other internet communities (including [allegedly poaching pics from /r/keto and harassing the redditor(s) involved](http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21esj) and [harassment of specific employees of imgur.com](http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs20tiq), as well as other similar transgressions.

>We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action. [We’re banning behavior, not ideas.](http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21aj4)

To paraphrase: As long as you can keep it 100% confined within the subreddit, anything within legal bounds still goes. As soon as content/discussion/'politics' of the subreddit extend out to other users on reddit, communities, or people on other social media platforms with the intent to harass, harangue, hassle, shame, berate, bemoan, or just plain fuck with, that's when there's problems. FPH *et al.*  was apparently struggling with this part.

**As for the 'what about X community' questions abounding in this thread and elsewhere--** answers are sparse at the moment.  Users are asking about why one controversial community continues to exist while these are banned, and the only answer available at the moment is this: 

>[We haven’t banned it because that subreddit hasn’t had the recent ongoing issues with harassment, either on-site or off-site. That’s the main difference between the subreddits that were banned and those that are being mentioned in the comments - they might be hateful or distasteful, but were not actively engaging in organized harassment of individuals. /r/shitredditsays does come up a lot in regard to brigading, although it’s usually not the only subreddit involved. We’re working on developing better solutions for the brigading problem.](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs23hqk?context=3)

They were often from scared and confused people who didn’t know why they were being targeted, and were in fear for their or their loved ones safety.It was an identifiable trend, and it was always leading back to the fat-shaming subreddits. Upon investigation, it was found that not only was the community engaging in harassing behavior but the mods were not only participating in it, but even at times encouraging it.The ban of these communities was in no way intended to censor communication. It was simply to put an end to behavior that was being fostered within the communities that were banned. We are a platform for human interaction, but we do not want to be a platform that allows real-life harassment of people to happen. We decided we simply could no longer turn a blind eye to the human beings whose lives were being affected by our users’ behavior.

NOTE: I'm not advancing any of these as fact because in each case I've seen dispute over them, or a sufficient lack of inclusion to make me suspicious

4. Both of the police officers were shot, sustaining non-threatening injuries.
5. After the shooter entered the school, the police on scene didn't make an effort to enter the school for 45 to 60 minutes.
6. The police officers on scene physically restrained a number of parents who wanted to enter the school to confront the shooter and/or save their children.

Also, why tf are people wiping out toilet paper? I had to make sure to buy extra because people are clearing the store out, so I don't run out. I don't know what the purpose of stockpiling either of these things are, but it's annoying. It reminds me of the ""gas scare"" here in San Antonio right after that hurricane hit Houston. I wasn't worried, but when everyone else got worried, I was forced to find gas just because everyone was freaked out, no stations had gas, and I was running on almost empty thinking everyone was dumb. Drove a few miles out of the city, surprise! No gas shortage. I went to pick up a friend from the Houston airport a few days later. All the stations I saw there had gas, no one was freaked out.

 https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-republicans-who-sat-during-zelenskys-speech-1768962

And more than 1/2 of house members didn't attend. 

given the popularity of Ukraine in the eyes of the world and that they're battling our arch enemy, I thought we would all, esp the warhawks, be on board so what gives?

Edit: thanks for all the responses.  I have read all of them and these are the big ones.

1. The gop would rather not spend the money in a foreign war.

While this make logical sense, I point to the fact that we still spend about 800b a year on military which appears to be a sacred cow to them.  Also, as far as I can remember, Russia has been a big enemy to us.  To wit: their meddling in our recent elections.  So being able to severely weaken them through a proxy war at 0 lost of American life seems like a win win at very little cost to other wars (Iran cost us 2.5t iirc). So far Ukraine has cost us less than 100b and most of that has been from supplies and weapons.

2. GOP opposing Dem causes just because...

This seems very realistic to me as I continue to see the extremists take over our country at every level.  I am beginning to believe that we need a party to represent the non extremist from both sides of the aisle. But c'mon guys, it's Putin for Christ sakes. Put your difference aside and focus on a real threat to America (and the rest of the world!)

3. GOP has been co-oped by the Russians.

I find this harder to believe (as a whole). Sure there may be a scattering few and I hope the NSA is watching but as a whole I don't think so.  That said, I don't have a rational explanation of why they've gotten so soft with Putin and Russia here.",learning

In an apparent act of protest, they have gone private!

As you can see on the /r/the_donald splash page, they're protesting the removal of three of their mods and what they feel is a biased approach taken by the admins in regard to their subreddit.  Here's a screenshot of their splash page, for longevity:

Let's take a look at a snippet of the write-up by /u/stopscopiesme in /r/SubredditDrama:

>For context, /r/The_Donald has clashed with the admins for quite a while, and had several rules imposed on it, like [being banned from linking to r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/57e8bc/the_reddit_admins_have_asked_rthe_donald_to_stop/). It is also speculated that the algorithm for r/all being redone and the ability to filter r/all were specific acts taken because of and against the_donald. This crackdown from the admins also comes after a new set of [much stricter rules for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/). While resentments between t_d mods and the admins have been simmering for a long time, there are some specific recent events that have led to this which I detailed in a post yesterday, copied here

>https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/

>Yesterday, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bq61e/hey_admins_try_setting_this_post_to_0/) post daring the admins to change the score  appeared on r/all for a few hours despite showing a score of 0. Many users inside and outside of The_Donald assumed the admins had actually manipulated the score. (Although it's worth noting there's no evidence of this and it could be related to the same glitch that caused the entire frontpage to be r/the_donald. Others are speculating that the post had a positive score before reaching r/all and being downvoted by non t_d users, and then it took a while to disappear from the listing). A similar thing happened with a [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bs8fo/and_they_reset_it_to_0_reddit_is_really_showing/). To my knowledge, the admins have not responded to these accusations.

>Today, a t_d mod stickied a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bx71r/announcement_we_keep_reddit_alive_but_reddit_is/) ( [mirror](http://archive.is/ysbVu) ) condemning the restrictions admins have placed on the subreddit and threatning that t_d users will leave. The moderator promotes reddit clone Voat, which yesterday announced it may shut down due to lack of funds. Another user is promoting [both Voat and his own site](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bz637/hey_centipedes_ceo_of_gab_here_why_are_you_still/) as an alternative.

OutOfTheLoop,What is up with Gen Z humor?,"Gen Z, please explain

I am a 35F millennial and my youngest sister is a 22F who I love with all my heart. She is the best marshmallow squishy ray of light I’ve ever known. When I see her I just want to connect in every way possible to get that sibling good good. 

She sends me some memes like this one (first link below) and I genuinely do not understand ANY of them. 

https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2133415-are-ya-winning-son

Here is another example that compares the different generations and their type of humor. I’d say it’s pretty dang accurate. 

https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/collections/15-reminders-that-gen-z-are-still-the-future-of-memes

My question is: can anyone explain to me, the definition of gen z humor in a way I could understand? I usually laugh at the memes she sends and she told me once that she loved how I understood it so I don’t want to ask her to explain since this is one of the only ways she has chosen to connect with me and my stupid pride caused me to not want her to know how clueless I am out of fear that my squishy will reject me. 

What I really don’t understand is the “why” of the Gen z humor. Boomer= low hanging fruit that is 25% funny, 75% putting down other people. Millennial humor is self deprecating jokes about wanting to be dead. Gen X humor is… idk, I never hear about them honestly. Then Gen Z humor (to me) is about taking acid, ending up on the astral plane and saying one to five words that vaguely represent the picture in the meme. 

This is not sarcastic or an insult to Gen Z, I genuinely want to understand.

I keep hearing how awful and unwatchable the final season is. And the creators are making a new Star Wars series (not sure if it's film or TV), and I hear a lot of complaining that these aren't the guys we're looking for judging by the last season of GoT.

Edit: WOW! This blew up way more than I expected. I had no idea so many people hated their “Smart TVs”. I’m glad this information was useful to everyone!

Also thank you for all the upvotes, awards and comments. Hopefully this becomes common knowledge and people can take back control of their TVs!

Edit 2: another link you can add to your block list is samsungads.com. Combined with the above link you *should* be entirely ad free.

Edit 3: So A TON of people are asking how to block ads on other TV’s/Devices. Ive compiled a few “How To’s” for LG, ROKU and Fire Stick. Hope this helps everyone struggling with these damn ads!

**LG**: To disable LG ads that appear in ""My Content"" tab, LG store etc. blacklist/block the following domains on your router: 

ngfts.lge.com

us.ad.lgsmartad.com

lgad.cjpowercast.com

edgesuite.net

us.info.lgsmartad.com


**Roku:** If you go into the privacy settings on your Roku TV you can turn these ads off, but it also turns off the more ways to watch feature. To turn this off go to your Settings and select Privacy. There you will find an option to “Use Information From TV Inputs.” Turning that off should disable these pop-up ads. (Not the best but its something)

**Amazon Fire Stick:**
This requires you to download an app but it will work. Go to downloader and search for (~~)&amp;amp;amp;lt;strike&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;s&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;“http://stop and.io”.——-Click “blocks ads now” and you will be taken to the download page(~~) ——Thanks to u/jtn19120 for the update! (See below)

Go to http://blokada.org via Downloader instead, scroll down, install the latest———That’s it!

Edit 4: Everyone’s router is going to be different when it comes to blocking/blacklisting domains (websites, etc) as far as i know there’s no “one size fits all scenario” BUT there’s hope.

Locate your router and flip it upside down (literally) on the bottom there should be a URL/website you use to login to your router and make changes (this is how you configure your WiFi names, create passwords, etc) within the same settings there should be a “security” tab or something along the lines (Netgear has the security tab under “Advanced”) from there you should see a block sites/block services tab. Click on the block sites tab (Netgear) and type in the domain (the ones I provided) and add them. That’s it. Let me see if i can locate the instructions for more popular routers and I’ll be back!

Edit 5: Ok I think I was able to find a “universal—ish” guide to blocking sites on your router.

1. Open your router's configuration page. If the sites you want to block aren't encrypted, you can usually block them using your router's built-in tools. To access these, open the router's configuration page in a web browser on a computer that's connected to your network. 

Common router addresses include:

Linksys - http://192.168.1.1

D-Link/Netgear - http://192.168.0.1

Belkin - http://192.168.2.1

ASUS - http://192.168.50.1/

AT&T U-verse - http://192.168.1.254

Comcast - http://10.0.0.1

**If you have a router that’s not listed, do a quick google search and you will find your router login information**

2. Enter your router's login information. If you never changed this information, enter in the default administrator account information. For many routers, this is usually ""admin"" or blank for the username, and ""admin"" or blank for the password. Check your router's documentation if you don't know the default login information. (THIS IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO SECURE YOUR ROUTER WITH A STRONG USERNAME AND PASSWORD FYI!)

3. Find the ""URL Filtering"" or ""Blocking"" section. The location of this will vary depending on your router. You may find this in the ""Firewall"" menu, or in the ""Security"" section. (SEARCH AROUND, ITS THERE I PROMISE)

4. Add the URLs that you want to block. Enter each URL that you want to block on your connected devices. (THIS IS WHERE YOU ENTER THE ADDRESS I PROVIDED)

5. Click save and thats it!


Edit 6: 

Sony/Android TV ad removal

1- Go into Settings &amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Apps 2- Find ""Android TV Core Services"" 3- Roll back all updates on it (will warn you that you're rolling back to initial version... skip over that... you don't want it.) 4- Return to the Home screen and remove the Sponsored ""channel"" by clicking far left on the row and using the minus (-) button. 5- Return to Apps in Settings and look for ""Android TV Core Services"" again. 6- Force Stop it and then DISABLE it.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK that Amazon has a serious problem with counterfeit products, and it's all because of something called ""commingled inventory.""","Anecdotally, the problem is getting *severe.* I used to buy all my household basics on Amazon (shampoo, toothpaste, etc), and I've gotten a very high rate of fake products over the past 2 years or so, specifically.

Most recently, I bought a bottle of shampoo that seemed really odd and gave me a pretty serious rash on my scalp. I contacted the manufacturer, and they confirmed it was a fake. Amazon will offer to give your money back if you send it back, but that's all the protection you have as a buyer.

Since I started noticing this issue, I've gotten counterfeit batteries, counterfeit shampoo, and counterfeit guitar strings, and they were *all sold by Amazon.com.* It got so bad that I completely stopped using Amazon. 

The bigger question is ""what the hell is going on?"" This didn't seem to be a problem, say, 5 years ago. I started looking into why this was the case, and I found a pretty clear answer: **commingled inventory.**

Basically, it works like this:

- As we know, Amazon has third-party sellers that have their products fulfilled by Amazon.
- These sellers send in their products to be stored at an Amazon warehouse
- When a buyer buys that item, Amazon will ship the products directly to buyers.

Sounds straight-forward enough, right? Here's the problem, though: **Amazon treats all items with the same SKU as identical.**

So, let's say I am a third-party seller on Amazon, and I am selling Crest Toothpaste. I send 100 tubes of Crest Toothpaste to Amazon for Amazon fulfillment, and then 100 tubes are listed by me on Amazon. The problem is that my tubes of Crest aren't entered into the system as ""SolitaryEgg's Storefront Crest Toothpaste,"" they are just entered as ""Crest Toothpaste"" and thrown into a bin with *all the other crest toothpaste.* Even the main ""sold by Amazon.com"" stock.

You can see why this is not good. If you go and buy something from Amazon, you'll be sent a product that literally anyone could've sent in. It's basically become a big flea market with no accountability, and even Amazon themselves don't keep track of who sent in what. It doesn't matter if you buy it directly from Amazon, or a third party seller with 5 star reviews, or a third party seller with 1 star reviews.  Regardless, someone (or a robot) at the warehouse is going to go to the Crest Toothpaste bin, grab a random one, and send it to you. And it could've come *from anywhere.*

This is especially bad because it doesn't just *allow* for counterfeit items, it actively encourages it. If I'm a shady dude, I can send in a bunch of fake crest toothpaste. I get credit for those items and can sell them on Amazon. Then when someone buys it from me, my customer will *probably* get a legitimate tube that some other seller (or Amazon themselves) sent in. My fake tubes will just get lost in the mix, and if someone notices it's fake, some other poor seller will likely get the bad review/return. 

I started looking around Amazon's reviews, and almost *every product* has some % of people complaining about counterfeit products, or products where the safety seal was removed and re-added. It's not everyone of course, but it seems like some % of people get fake products pretty much across the board, from vitamins to lotions to toothpastes and everything else. Seriously, go check any household product right now and read the 1-star reviews, and I guarantee you you'll find photos of fake products, items with needle-punctures in the safety seals, etc etc. It's rampant. Now, sure, some of these people might be lying, but I doubt they all are.

In the end, this ""commingled inventory"" has created a pretty serious counterfeit problem on amazon, and it can actually be a *really really* serious problem if you're buying vitamins, household cleaners, personal hygiene products, etc. And there is literally nothing you can do about it, because commingled inventory also means that ""sold by amazon"" and seller reviews are completely meaningless.

It's surprising to me that this problem seems to get almost no attention. Here's a source that explains it pretty well:

https://blog.redpoints.com/en/amazon-commingled-inventory-management

but you can find a lot of legitimate sources online to read more about it. A lot of big newspapers have covered the issue. A few more reads:

EDIT: And, no, I'm not an anti-Amazon shill. No, I don't work for Amazon's competitors (do they even have competitors anymore?). I'm just a person who got a bunch of fake stuff on Amazon, got a scalp rash from counterfeit shampoo, then went down an internet rabbit hole.",learning

YouShouldKnow,YSK that apologizing to your children and admitting when you're wrong is what teaches them to have Integrity,"There are a lot of parents with this philosophy of ""What I say goes, I'm the boss , everyone bow down to me, I can do no wrong"". 

This approach is detrimental to raising children who take accountability for their own actions. They need to see you admit to your faults, and you do owe them an apology when you mess up, even if you happen to think that ""seems stupid because they're just a kid"". 

Children learn by example, and they pick up on so many nuances, minutiae, and unspoken truths. 

You aren't fooling them into thinking you're perfect by refusing to admit mistakes - you're teaching them that to apologise is shameful and should be avoided at all costs. You cannot treat a child one way and then expect them to comport themselves in the opposite manner.

- My father modeled a wonderful example by always apologizing and admitting when he was wrong, and it did not affect how we viewed him as the boss of the household. I also experienced the opposite with my biological mother, who is a clinically diagnosed Narcissist.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK the easiest way to make sure your kid fights you on every chore is to avoid saying ""thank you.""","I'm a teacher. Every year, I get at least one parent who tells me that they just expect their kids to do their chores, and they won't ever say ""thank you"" for doing them. Then these parents wonder why their kids fight them on chores. 

These same parents often tell me they don't understand why their kids put so much effort into my class. 

It's really very easy. I thank them for their answers in class. I thank them for helping their classmates. I thank them for picking up after a lab. I thank them when they give their presentations. 

Every opportunity I have to do it, I say ""thank you."" 

My mom always gave me an enthusiastic ""thank you!"" when my sister and I did chores. As a result, we always did them, often without being asked. We said ""thank you"" when she made dinner. 

A home culture of saying ""thank you"" is a very easy and effective way to improve adult/teen relationships, and you'll have happier teens too.

YouShouldKnow,YSK that people dealing with depression can find it incredibly hard to maintain contact with friends and family. If someone hasn’t been in touch for months don’t assume they’re a bad friend.,"This is prompted by the comments on a r/Facepalm post with lots of people saying if someone hasn’t checked up on you this year they’re a shitty friend, there’s no excuse etc.

Why YSK: Over the years I’ve known friends and family withdraw from the world for months on end because of depression or other illnesses. They often carry a lot of guilt about this and it becomes a self perpetuating issue because they’re afraid of the response they’ll get when they eventually do make contact again. You often won’t know what’s going on with them, they’ll just drop off the radar. But these people will need your friendship and support more than ever when they begin to engage with the world again. So if someone goes quiet don’t write them off as a ‘shitty friend’. Be open minded about their reasons, give them space, time and understanding, and be ready to pick up the threads again when they’re ready.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK That it doesn't matter if you are skinny, fat, fit, or none of the above; DO NOT be intimidated by others in the gym.

It doesn't matter if you're in there trying to lose weight, put on size, or just maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle. Everyone in the gym is working towards a common goal; bettering themself.

There isn't a single person in the entire gym that knows EVERYTHING. There are so many different styles and techniques that it's nearly impossible. Don't expect someone to approach and help critique you because there is a fear of coming off as a know it all or a prick even though that's never the intention. But I guarantee if you ask someone who looks like they know what they are doing they would be MORE than happy to help. All you have to do is ask. Some of the nicest people I've met are the strongest guys/gals in the gym at any given time. 

I say this because I witnessed it happen at the gym today. Someone with not a lot of experience was in a workout room that eventually filled with 3/4 ""bigger"" guys. While it was just him and I in there he was just doing his thing. After they got there, he did maybe two more sets before putting his weight away and hastily grabbing his jacket to leave the gym. To anyone that knows how to read people, anxiety was written all over his face. I could be wrong, but I do believe it's why he left.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK if you randomly see a dryer sheet in the back of your mailbox, your mail carrier put it there for a reason","Why YSK: it could save your carrier from being stung

Letter Carrier here. 

We’re almost to the month of May which means nice weather, hanging out outside, school closing for the summer, and the return of those dastardly devils: Yellowjackets and Wasps.

I’m sure you’ve noticed. But just in case you haven’t, this time of the year wasps and Yellowjackets (especially Yellowjackets) like to make nests inside of mailboxes. In a lot of places this time of the year, it’s just beginning to warm up outside, but it’s still fairly cold at night. So mailboxes provide nice, easy shelter for them. 

I can’t tell you how many times, especially during this part of the year, where I’ve opened up a box to see a little nest with 3-5 Yellowjackets just chillin. If I’m really unlucky, they will have made their nest at the very back of the box so I wind up sticking my hand in not knowing they are there. We all know how temperamental these little douchebags are and merely existing in their presence is enough to piss them off. Last year alone I was stung 10 times on 10 separate occasions. 

Getting to my point. We’ve found that they hate scented dryer sheets. If we encounter a box that is a problem for nests, we’ll often put one in there and it does the trick.

So please, if you one day randomly see a dryer sheet at the back of your mailbox, just know that your carrier more than likely put it there to deter these Satanic creatures from building their home in it.

Edit: there’s been a lot of good questions in the comments and I’m having a heck of a time replying to them so let me just add an edit.

1. It really doesn’t matter so much what brand you buy, if it’s eco-friendly, or what scent it is. All that matters is that it is scented. The scent seems to be what deters them. So any scented dryer sheet should suffice!

2. This should only be used as a *preventative measure.* I’ve never tried when there’s a huge nest so I have no idea if it would work. I just immediately leave a note on the customer’s door letting them know they need to take care of the nest before I can resume delivering their mail. It would be best to get rid of the large nest and then put a dryer sheet in to keep them from coming back.

3. As far as when to replace them, just check it periodically to see if the scent is still strong or if it has faded. The scent, once again, is what drives them away. So if the scent isn’t as strong or it has completely faded, it’s time to replace it.",learning

Never made it lol, most things still terrify me). I can't tell y'all the number of times I've been told I'm just fishing for attention if i let people know. This has just made me more and more reserved on an emotional level and now i hate talking about feelings even when it's someone i can trust. My panic attacks have gotten worse and i have a hard time reaching out for help when when i know i need it. 


Please be mindful of people in general, regardless of whether they seem socially reserved or not. You NEVER know what they are going through. Making a judgement of someone based on their exterior personality only pushes them away.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK: Most drain cleaning/sewer services scam customers out of hundreds to thousands of dollars. This is a guide for anyone who owns or plans to own a house that will allow you spot the tricks they use, as well as tips to prevent you from needing to use a service at all.","Why YSK: I used to be a drain cleaner. EVERY SINGLE DAY I had people coming to me for a second opinion because they were told they had to replace their sewer line for 5 grand. In the two years I spent drain cleaning, I only came across a whopping FOUR people that actually needed their sewer line replaced and well over a hundred that were told they had to. Here are some of the many tactics these companies use:

-The most common one is that they couldn’t get their blades past a blockage so the line must be broken. If this were true, the blades would come back with either mud on them, or completely clean and shiny. Even then, there are lots of other reasons why they could be shiny so it’s not a definite break in the line.

-They clean the line with small or sometimes even no blades. If it’s the mainline, at least 3 inch blades should be used. Preferably 4 inch though. But some companies don’t do that. So they will poke a hole into the blockage, and everything will run just fine...for a few days. Shortly after, that tiny hole will close again and you’ll call them back out. They’ll try to convince you it’s because the line is broken when it’s not.

-They make you think roots in the mainline are a huge deal and the line must be replaced. Roots are the most common cause of sewer line backups. It’s incredibly common and should be expected if you have a tree near your sewer line. Some people will go ten years before their first root caused backup because it can take time for the roots to get through the pipe. Your sewer line is still in good shape. Just get it snaked every year and use root killer to slow the growth. 

-They scope the line and find bellies with sitting water or small offsets. While not ideal, most houses have them and it’s not necessarily a big deal. It’s something to keep an eye on, not waste 5-10 grand on.






Here’s some general tips regarding the trade:

-If the company doesn’t have the prices online, don’t tell them if you’re renting out the house. If you’re a landlord they’ll assume you’ve got extra cash and up charge you.

-If your basement has a floor drain, get a $10 water alarm. If it ever backs up, you’ll know immediately and stop the spread of water before it causes massive amounts of damage. This is particularly important if you don’t go into the basement often. I once went to an elderly lady’s house that had a foot of water in the basement. She was too old to go downstairs and didn’t notice the smell because she was hooked up to an oxygen tank thingy. Decades of memories stored in boxed were destroyed. 

-If you have a sewer line scoped, make sure you see them do it yourself. They like to swap footage with another house and act like your line is broken. Also make sure they use at least 3 inch blades on your mainline. Also make sure to get a copy of the footage. You can send it to multiple companies and they’ll usually give you their opinion for free so you don’t need it scoped multiple times!

-Clean out the p-traps to your sinks. I’ve had dozens of people call me to spend five minutes unscrewing their trap, cleaning it out, the putting it back. When I try to tell them that it’s easy to do yourself they say they don’t mess around with anything plumbing related. But seriously, watch a two minute video and do it yourself in 5 minutes and save a hundred bucks. 

-DO NOT FLUSH ANYTHING DOWN THE TOILET UNLESS IT CAME OUT OF YOU, OR ITS TOILET PAPER!!!! It doesn’t matter if your wipes say they’re “flushable”. it doesn’t matter if it’s “just a few tampons”. It doesn’t matter if you “didn’t think your kid was dumb enough to flush his cat stuffed animal”. Don’t do it! Just because it gets past the toilet doesn’t mean it gets through the whole line. If you’re flushing wipes or tampons, there’s a good chance your just collecting them and one day you will be met with a very unpleasant surprise. I’ve seen anywhere from a couple tampons clogging the line to filling up HALF OF A FIVE GALLON BUCKET with tampons. The only thing worse than spending 10 hours fishing for tampons is spending a thousand bucks for someone to fish for your tampons. 




There’s a lot more to it but I’m doubtful many will even read this. Which is a shame because I saw people getting scammed every single day and it’s easily avoidable. Most people don’t know much of this and these companies know that. And they take advantage of it.




Edit: I forgot to mention, don’t use any draino or anything similar. It’s very acidic. It can melt away pipes overtime and does a very poor job anyways. It usually only pokes holes into things. Save your pipes and clean out the trap yourself by hand, or call someone to do it.

Also, I highly recommend never using a snake yourself for the mainline, or even really a kitchen line. I have no idea how places like Home Depot are allowed to rent them out to just anyone. I know people that were trained to use them and still lost a finger. If you’re not incredibly familiar with it you can go from being just fine to missing a finger in literally a split second. Spend the extra hundred dollars and have a professional do it. It takes a long time to be trained to use it and messing up or not knowing how to use it properly can cost you a finger or two.

Also, if your toilets start to bubble/gargle when you run any water, your line is most likely going to be backing up. You could have a backup in one minute, or in a week. It’s best to have someone out ASAP!


People are asking why you shouldn’t use the snake yourself or how I could cause a lot of damage. [This is why. BE WARNED, THIS IS NSFW AND GOREY. And this isn’t even the worst that can happen!](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/ibdelp/got_a_piece_of_my_pinky_finger_ripped_off_by_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Also, drain cleaners love kitchen sink disposals because it keeps them in business. The more food you put down, the more likely it will get clogged. Especially avoid greasy foods, egg shells, and coffee grounds. If you’d like to avoid a backup, don’t put any food down the sink and use a paper towel to wipe off excess grease on dishes!

YouShouldKnow,"YSK that you’re probably picking snails up wrong. You shouldn’t lift them straight up as this can cause mantle collapse, which can cause the snail a very painful death. You should gently slide them until they detach from the surface, or poke them until they contract into the shell then lift them up.","The mantle is a muscle that holds the body to the shell and is responsible for keeping the shape of the snail inside the shell. It secretes calcium carbonate and is essential for healthy maintainence of the shell. The mantle encloses a delicate sac containing vital organs, including the lung and gills. Normally the mantle is expanded to meet the outer lip of the shell and you can see it encroaching and sometimes covering the columella. 

If you keep pet snails or are rescuing them from a pavement for example, you should either slide them and get lift them off a smooth surface, or poke the shell gently until they retreat then lift them that way. Pulling them directly up when the foot is attached to the surface can cause mantle collapse. The mantle can either tear away from where it is connected to the shell or collapse entirely. Tears can heal quite quickly, because the snails can seem largely unaffected. They can still move around and eat, so it isn't long before they heal.

However, if the mantle collapses the snail probably won’t survive. A collapsed mantle looks like a sock covering the body. You can see over the rim and right down into the shell. The snail (when extended) looks strange and struggles to pull its shell around. It also struggles to retract as it has no real cavity to invaginate into. The collapse puts quite a bit of pressure on the lung as the breathing cavity is restricted. The snail often suffocates, or starves. Mantle collapse can sometimes be healable, depending to the degree of collapse, but it takes much longer because it is difficult to get the snail to eat/breathe properly. 

If you keep pet snails and notice one showing signs of mantle collapse, you should use clove oil as an anaesthetic, then freeze it so it is safely and humanely euthanised. If you don’t, the snail will probably suffer a terribly painful death as it can starve or suffocate, and cannot retreat into its shell for comfort and protection.

[Edit: man, I’m speechless but pleasantly surprised this post blew up! I come back a couple hours later and I have hundreds of comments to sift through and upvote! I hope it saves a few snails :) I just wanted to say thank you to all my snail saving comrades, and please don’t feel guilty if you accidentally damaged them whilst trying to save them.

There’s no way I can respond to everyone, though I’d really like to, so I also wanted to address a couple points!
1) who picks up snails? Well, I pick snails up, and so do others! If I see one in danger of being crushed, I pick it up using this method and move it gently to the nearest patch of vegetation. 
2) do snails feel pain? Well, I don’t know for certain that snails feel pain, I can only imagine they do. This isn’t a pleasant way to die. Doctors didn’t think babies felt pain until they discovered they did, so just in case I try to treat fellow living creatures with respect. 
3) yes, people keep snails as pets! Check out r/snails for some inspiration and tips if you’re looking to get involved with keeping them :) they’re great pets. 
4) a lot of you are very violent and cruel. It makes me sad to know so many people out there take delight in causing a defenceless animal such hurt. As one user so helpfully pointed out, it’s ‘not a dog’, so why should we treat it kindly? Well, it’s still a living creature, and we should treat them with respect.
5) yes, I said invaginate. It means to be turned inside out or folded back on itself to form a cavity or pouch.]",learning

YouShouldKnow,YSK that both The channels “Puppy Love” and “Pets Kittens” purposefully put animals in dangerous situations just so they can film themselves “rescuing” said animals,"Why YSK: These people are abusing these animals, and many of them, despite getting “rescued” are likely actually dead because of the abuse they suffered. More attention needs to be brought to this so that Youtube can shut them down

Nick Crowley has a good video on this explaining the situation (Trigger warning, even though he blurs things out it can still be upsetting watching these animals getting abused)

In the video, he covered these two channels, originally called Happy Dog and Rescue Journey TV when the video was made. After the video both channels changed their names and turned off comments

Both videos will upload almost daily videos showing dogs and cats in almost impossible situations, just to pull them out, in some cases using the same dog or cat more than one time for multiple rescues and performing rescues that seem to garner the most views. 

It’s completely despicable and I have no doubt these aren’t the only two channels that do these things. There’s likely an entire plethora of channels with poor animals getting hurt just to gain internet fame. 

This needs more attention so that Youtube will finally step up and crack down on channels that do this, so that no more innocent animals need to get hurt just so someone can receive that internet clout

In the emails, the hacker claims to have hacked your device and used his new found privileges to record you while pleasuring yourself. To prove that he is legitimate, he tells you your ACTUAL password.

The hacker demands that you send cash to their bitcoin account or they'll send the compromising footage to your contacts list and your social media friends. They also threaten to publish all your private data (pics, documents, videos... etc) to the internet if you do not comply.

**These are all empty threats.**

What they do is find/buy stolen password lists from the dark-web and send these blackmail emails to the people on that list. The fact that they have a legit password is often enough to compel people into complacency.

This is a hot topic right now, but [here](https://youtu.be/VJhsjUPDulw) is a great visualization of how Bracketed Taxes works. 

Edit: These brackets are for all income, not just higher income. For example, the first bracket currently is from $0 - $9,875 and is at 10%. They increase from there. So all income is taxed using brackets. And EVERY person is taxed the same 10% on their first up to $9,875 of income. This also applies to your ~~adjusted income~~ taxable income, so after deductions. There are many who, after deductions, fall below or at $0 which would make them tax free. It's not a flat rate of income though because there are so many deductions that many different taxable incomes can qualify. 

Edit: it's been pointed out that the other or technical term for this is marginal tax rate. I believe the terms are interchangeable but there are much more qualified individuals that have clarified in the comments section so I'll let them take the credit!

For example: if you make $410,000 a year and you hear that taxes will be more for those making $400,000 it really means that taxes will be more on *income* over $400,000. The only portion you pay that higher tax rate on would be the last $10,000 - not all $410,000. This is how it works for all brackets.

Why YSK: it's important to understand how Bracketed Taxes work as some people will use a higher tax rate to spread fear. This may freaks someone out that makes just a bit more than the bracket that is being increased. While some think they will now pay a higher rate on all their income, they will actually only pay a higher rate on the income in that tax bracket.",learning

YouShouldKnow,"YSK: In the US, hospitals are required to help pay for your medical bills if you make under a certain amount of money (typically 200-300% of the Federal Poverty Level). This could potentially cover the entirety of your hospital bill.","Why YSK: You should be aware of the medical care that is available to you, as well as the potential costs. Knowing that your hospital bill may be covered if your financial situation is not ideal could make the difference between life and death.

A provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals must provide a “financial assistance policy” that must “must apply to all emergency and other medically necessary care provided by the hospital facility” in order for the hospital to maintain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit. Seeing as 57% of all hospitals are non-profit, this policy applies to majority of hospitals. If you are uninsured, these policies are most likely to apply to you. However, even insured people can qualify in many situations. 

Simply search "" \*name of hospital\* financial assistance "" and go to the hospital's financial assistance page. Somewhere on that page there should be a document called ""Financial Assistance Policy"", and inside of that it will tell you the qualifying income for total coverage, as well as qualifying income for partial coverage. Please read it thoroughly to understand what you may or may not qualify for. For the most part this only applies to emergent, non-elective, and catastrophic care.. otherwise known as ""medically necessary care"". 

As an example, the hospital closest to me covers my entire hospital bill if I make under 200% of the FPL, which would mean I have to make less than $25,760 if I was a 1 person household, or $53,000 for my family of 4. In addition they will offer partial coverage if I make under 600% of the FPL.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK that no matter how close you are with your children, you should not share the details of your marital problems with them.","Trust me. They may seem very intelligent, mature and understanding and they may be so too but you can do your children a very great favor by not blurring this line, or else, without you even realizing it can become an immense and distressing burden for your children.

Edit: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up like this but I am very glad it did. Thank you so everyone who is sharing their personal stories, the fact that you went through all this and it’s negative impacts on you is a testament to why this advice matters.

Also thank you so much for all the awards.

Some people seem to be missing my point or perhaps he I could’ve been clearer. So there are a couple of clarifications:
 
• this post in no way suggests that you should lie to your children and pretend like everything is okay when it is not
• there is a middle ground between lying to your children, pretending there is no problem, and evading any questions they may have and sharing way too much and even unintentionally putting all the baggage on them and feeling like it’s their responsibility to fix it.
• this post does suggest that you should not, no matter the maturity intelligence level of your children, you should NOT put the burden of your marital/divorce-related problems to the children, do not mistake them for your marriage counselor, or your best friend, or your confidante.
• you may be alone, go make friends or talk to a therapist, please
• not dumping every single emotional baggage on your children IS different than having a conversation with them  and talking with them about the issues that may affect them on a need-to-know bases 
• also, abuse is a human rights violation is different than cheating and smaller fights, and requires a separate consideration along with any other safety threats.

YouShouldKnow,YSK that the term “non-GMO” is essentially an advertising ploy. GMOs have no established health risks in humans.,"I expect comments might say this is common knowledge. I will point out that a lot of people don't know about GMOs or science in general, including some of my own friends and family. This post is meant to address those people.

The only legitimate controversies over GMOs involve ethical or environmental concerns. One example is Belgian Blue, a breed of cattle that contains extra muscles. Critics say it is unethical to create that kind of cow. Note that the issue here is NOT human health. The cows themselves are perfectly safe to eat.

I will repeat what I said in the title: GMOs have no established health risks in humans. In some cases, they are actually beneficial to humans. Consider golden rice, a modified version of rice that contains added precursors for vitamin A. This was meant to combat vitamin A deficiency in Asia, which can lead to blindness. The public’s perception of GMOs prevented golden rice from succeeding, as was addressed in a letter from over 100 Nobel prize laureates (discussed [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/)).

GMOs do not cause cancer. They are created by inserting a non-naturally occurring gene or mutation into an organism which is then consumed by humans. While it is established that genetic modification can cause cancer, that would occur in the original organism, *not the consumer*. Genetic modifications are not passed between organisms. If you find yourself questioning that statement, consider the fact that genetic diseases are not transmissible.

There is an article from a Harvard blog that reinforces a lot of what I have said. [Check it out](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) if you’re interested, and I encourage you to do your own research as well.

YouShouldKnow,YSK: you are entitled to a refund if an airline cancels your ticket. Not a voucher or credit — a refund.,"I spent all day on the phone talking to Spirit Airlines, which is notoriously bad with customer service. They’ve cancelled Northeast flights and I wanted my money back. The service member working with me refused to refund me several times until I did the research and quoted the US Department of Transportation, whose website says, “if your flight is cancelled and you choose to cancel your trip as a result, you are entitled to a refund for the unused transportation.” I also threatened to have my credit card company dispute the charge.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK that children should NEVER be forced to give hugs, kisses, or any other affection to anyone - including family members","Teaching kids about bodily autonomy from an early age is crucial, and giving them the tools to politely (but firmly) say ""No"" when they feel uncomfortable  performing affectionate acts is a great first step. 

Critically, this must include parents and other family members,  even if those people get their feelings hurt. The child's bodily autonomy and setting them up for their future as adults is more important than Great-Aunt Gertrude getting a halfhearted hug.


THIS ALSO APPLIES TO TICKLING. If a kid breathlessly asks you to stop tickling them, *even if they appear to be enjoying themselves and laughing*, it's important that you stop for them to catch their breath and do a quick check-in to see of they want to continue. 

 Almost every time I've done this with my own son, he will ask for more tickles after catching his breath.

 It's about letting them know that their body belongs to THEM. 

**WHY YSK:**

Because everyone has the right to decide whether they want to be touched,  and that includes children,  from as early as possible. 

There are countless examples of all the dark things that kids suffer through every day which I don't need to get into, we all know what they are. 

To be clear, it is NEVER the child's fault if they are  victimized,  nor is this advice meant to be some kind of protection against evil.

YouShouldKnow,YSK that the 'cheap' gifts that you receive from your employer might actually be paid out of the pocket of your manager.,"Why YSK: I know it's the season to shit on shitty corporate gifts, and I'm all for it in the event that the money does come out of the corporate budget, but before you light your torches when you get your present, consider that what you received was paid from the pocket of someone not too far removed from you.

25 years ago, when we all got our first 'real jobs' out of college, I remember many of my mates bragging about their company-funded golf games and company-expensed dinners and amazing Christmas bonuses. In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.

Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. 'Here's the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about', I thought to myself.

I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. 'That's it?' I thought to myself 'I bust my chops all day for $15?' I was livid.

I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.

Instead, she said ""That was nice of her, spending her own money like that."" That's when I realized that this wasn't a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn't realize that we were the only team to get something.

My manager - who wasn't getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.

I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.

The VA has developed [a bunch of mental health apps](https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/mental-health) that are free to the general public.  Some were designed with veterans as the target audience, but some were designed to be used by anyone.

Some highlights are:

[Mindfulness Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/mindfulness-coach), which offers a self-guided mindfulness course and some recorded mindfulness exercises similar to what you can find on Headspace

[Insomnia Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/insomnia-coach), which walks you through a treatment program for insomnia and has features like guided imagery recordings

[MOVE Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/move-coach) which can help with weight loss and exercise in a guided program

YouShouldKnow,"YSK When you have self-defeating thoughts, feelings or habits, it helps to ask what’s the story behind them - and revise it. Psychologists call this story editing and it’s an actually engaging, evidence-based way to improve mental health.","Note: From the discussion below, I realise it may be more appropriate to say **reframe** rather than **revise** the story.

**Why YSK:** There’s significant evidence that story editing can improve mood, reduce depressive symptoms, help you find clarity and achieve closure on upsetting experiences. Having studied the research on mental health and tried many approaches myself, I always come back to story editing. It’s accessible, works for problems big and small, gets your mind unstuck, you name it.

TECHNIQUES: You can do a sort of brain dump, where you write without stopping or censoring yourself for 15 min (a form of the[ expressive writing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/expressive-writing-for-mental-health) pioneered by James Pennebaker). Another effective way is to write about an upsetting event from a third-person’s perspective ( a form of[ self-distancing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201901/the-art-self-distancing)).

If you think about it, it makes sense - we are storytelling creatures, after all. Sometimes the stories we tell get us into trouble and the way out is to learn to take control and not get frozen in bad stories.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK: water heaters have an anode rod that prevents the tank from corroding. If you replace it every few years, it will extend the life of your water heater from ~10 years to potentially 25+ years.","Why YSK: Water heaters use an anode rod to attract and remove sediments from the water being heated. An anode rod will corrode and deteriorate over time until it’s no longer capable of functioning and has to be replaced. This part literally sacrifices itself to keep the tank in optimal condition. That’s why it’s also referred to as a sacrificial anode. Without it, the water tank would start corroding from the inside out which would eventually result in a severe leak at the bottom.

After the anode rod deteriorates, the tank will begin corroding. This is the reason water heaters typically only last 5-15 years. If you replace the rod every few years (cheap and easy), it will extend the life of water heater by decades.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK that if your dog eats cooked bones, give them bread. It could save their life.","Long story short, my dog got ahold of a cooked bone. A big ol’ ham bone. She obliterated it. After some Googling, I found that you should immediately give them bread. 

I shoved bread down her gullet until she looked like she was pregnant. My vet commended the move and said with how much bone she ate and how much had splintered, the bread saved her life. And if not her life, it saved me from having to pay $3k+ for surgeries. A $3 loaf of bread saved my dog’s life. Crazy to think about. 

Why YSK: From my understanding, the bread “absorbs” the bone and keeps it from puncturing anything by essentially padding it. They may still need surgery to remove any big or sharp pieces, but it’s better than needing additional surgery for a puncture. 

**You of course should still bring your dog to the vet asap**, but all she ended up needing was some x-rays and pain meds. A shitty situation ended better than it could have.

YouTube how to do it and you could save yourself thousands. People who sell cars can be sketchy and are good are hiding previous damage or mechanical problems.

YouShouldKnow,YSK that its illegal for a restaurant to make a server pay for a dine and dash,"Why YSK: Many servers do not know or understand their rights. With these tough times, I've experienced this myself as a Bartender and had my restaurant try this on me. I know other servers are all experiencing a huge increase in dine and dashers. Top it off with most people only tipping 10% and its miserable. 

My restaurant in California tried this on me recently. I showed them the law and told them it wasn't happening. They did not like that but they let it drop because to fire me over it would be an insane lawsuit. I'm going to quit soon but thats a different story. 

YSK also that every state is a little different. Some states do allow it conditionally, but if you know your states laws, the restaurant will probably not mess with you. A lawsuit can dig up a nasty past and nobody can afford back pay right now. Bassisically, if they make it a problem, and you make it a bigger problem (lawsuit) they will go out of business. Especially right now. 

This applies to a lot of things, like working off the clock, owners/managers taking tips, meetings / writeups off the clock, and many other small tricks they use to save money from you.

YouShouldKnow,YSK your outdoor cat is causing detrimental damage to the environment,"Cats hunt down endangered birds and small mammals while they’re outdoors, and have become one of the largest risk to these species due to an over abundance of outdoor domestic cats and feral cats. Please reconsider having an outdoor cat because they are putting many animals onto the endangered list.

Edit to include because people have decided to put their personal feeling towards cats ahead of facts: the American Bird Conservancy has listed outdoor cats as the number one threat to bird species and they have caused about 63 extinctions of birds, mammals, and reptiles. Cats kill about 2.4 billion birds a year. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists cats as one of the worlds worst non-native invasive species.

If you want your cat to go outside, put it on a leash with a harness! That way you can monitor your cat and prevent it from hunting anything. Even if you don’t see it happen, they can still kill while you’re not watching them. A bell on their collar does not help very much to reduce their hunting effectiveness, as they learn to hunt around the bell. 

Also: indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor cats! It keeps them from eating things they shouldn’t, getting hit by cars, running away, or other things that put them in danger

I love how a lot of people commenting are talking about a bunch of the things that humans do to damage the environment, as if my post is blaming all environmental issues on cats. Environmental issues are multifaceted and need to be addressed in a variety of ways to ensure proper remediation. One of these ways is to take proper precautions with your cats. I love cats! I’ve had cats before and we ensured that they got lots of exercise and were taken outside while on harnesses or within a fenced yard that we can monitor them in and they can’t get out of. You’re acting like we don’t take the same precautions with dogs, even though dogs are able to be trained much more effectively than cats are.

I’m not sure why people are thinking that my personal feelings are invading this post when I haven’t posted anything about my personal feelings towards this issue.

YouShouldKnow,"YSK: If you want to start lifting, you're going to feel weaker than you actually are for a couple weeks because your brain is lazier than your muscles and doesn't want to change.","Why YSK: I've heard a lot of stories from people who give up on working out because they feel weak, or they go for a month but don't look or feel any different. They get embarrassed because they feel weaker than they expected. Well, you aren't, your brain is just lazy!

I had never heard this before I forced myself to take things seriously and got a trainer a couple years ago after failing to make progress on my own and feeling terrible. This was what they told me and I wanted to share: Your body has likely never had to fire a single dedicated muscle to move something. Ever. You have almost always been able to ""cheat"" moving something by using your core strength, keeping your arms in close and ""putting your back into it"". You're making up for your weaker muscles by giving them mechanical advantages in every way you can. So your brain has literally no idea *how* to contract your bicep(for example) by itself and wants to cheat. If you're using a machine, you might even catch yourself trying to get under the weight, even though logically you know it won't help. That's your brain fighting back against what is basically just seen as a massive waste of effort and an inefficient way to move something. You are literally fighting yourself.

Your first few weeks, if not your first couple *months* depending on frequency can feel embarrassing because you don't think you're doing it right, or it doesn't feel right, or you feel like you're getting nowhere. Your brain has to literally build the ability to focus and fire a muscle properly, and that takes time, and it's frustrating. As we age, it hates building new neural pathways even more, and it fights against your conscious efforts. It can be done, though!

The only way forward is to do the motion, with a comfortable weight, over and over until it gets there. This can't be rushed, it just takes time and consistent form and effort. You'll notice when it does, because things will start to feel better. You might have gained little to no muscle mass but you'll be able to move a little more weight. That can be confusing, but it's just your soggy meat-hunk finally getting the picture. Machines are actually great for this because in most cases you can't cheat the motion, which would do you no good at all.

If you feel embarrassed because you think you look weak, or foolish in a room full of people who aren't struggling, just remember that they went through the same thing once. They're probably mentally supporting you because they know getting started sucks. I felt terrible and out of place for a long time, but then suddenly you don't.

So don't give up on working out. Don't give up on your body. Don't feel embarrassed because you're struggling to literally curl 5 pounds(me). Keep at it, and understand that your brain is just a stubborn bit of hardware that has to be trained and changed with you. Put that work in. Plus, then you can do the Terry Crews thing where you bounce your pecs around.

Edit: For the curious or concerned here's an [interesting read about this](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Fulltext/2003/04000/Training_Induced_Changes_in_Neural_Function.2.aspx).   
TL;DR:  ""Resistance training elicits adaptive changes in the nervous system as well as in the morphology of the trained muscles (Fig. 6).  In particular, neural adaptation mechanisms are important for the  increases in maximal eccentric strength and rate of force development  observed with training.""

YouShouldKnow,YSK that i.e. and e.g. are not interchangeable,"This happens all the time where people misuse these two expressions. 

When you want to provide examples, e.g. is appropriate. So it’s correct to say “There were many fruits (e.g. lemons and apples),” but not to say “(i.e. lemons and apples).” i.e. is correctly used only when the thing after the i.e. is exactly what you’re referring to. So “he ate his two favorite fruits (i.e. lemons and apples),” is correct. And “(e.g. lemons and apples)” would not be correct. Lemons and apples aren’t *examples* of his two favorite fruits, they *are* his two favorite fruits. 

I know this sounds pedantic but it can lead to a ton of confusion since the two expressions mean fairly different things.",learning

formula1,"If you could eliminate a race within the year, which would it be, and why?","From my perspective, and it’s not going to be a popular one, but it would have to be Monaco. As years have gone by, it’s become too much of a procession/parade than a race for me, not enough space or opportunities to overtake on the circuit, making it more of a team tactics battle rather than a race. I do like the addition of some of the recent circuits such as Singapore and Azerbaijan as they have great opportunities for overtaking with some smart planning on the driver’s part.

baseball,What if every team was named after the most abundantly populated animal in their geographical area?,"Given the recent controversies over certain sports team names and the imminent rebranding of the Cleveland Indians as the Cleveland Guardians, I can't help but wonder what animal mascots would best represent the cities or states their teams reside in.        
          
Take the Tigers for example. When you think of Detroit, you do not think of a jugle ruled over by apex feline predators. I don't know if the Detroit zoo has any tigers, or if Detroit even has a zoo for that matter,  but I am 100% certain that there is at least 1 species of animal in Detroit and the surrounding areas that is more populous than tigers. The difficult part, however, is determining *which* animal is the most populous.       
        
With that in mind, it also gives rise to the concern that some teams would likely share the same name in this scenario due to their close proximity. Both Chicago and New York each have 2 teams, plus the Angels like to pretend that Los Angeles does as well, so there is bound to be some overlap. I have decided that this is okay, primarily because there is no way around it. Just to avoid any confusion as to which identically named team is which though, I'll break up this list by divisions. Anyway though, this is what the MLB would look like if all the teams had to rebrand as the most common animal in their region.

baseball,Joe West is spending his retirement editing his Wikipedia page to remove things that make him look bad,"On January 31st, an account called [Crewchief22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crewchief22) made a series of edits to [Joe West (umpire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_West_(umpire\)). The [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=prev&oldid=1136748497) removed information about an altercation with Joe Torre, with an edit summary of ""my changes corrected the lies that were in the incident with Joe Torre"". The edit was not immediately reverted, so the next day, Crewchief22 returned, first making [an edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=prev&oldid=1136973061) which removed information about West's suspensions, next making [various changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=next&oldid=1136973061) including removing the entire ""Reception"" section (which is not complimentary to West), and finally making [a small edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=next&oldid=1136975679) summarized ""grammer"", which arguably made the sentence in question make less sense. These changes stayed up until February 3rd, when another user noticed them and rolled back the article to the version before Crewchief22 showed up. Undeterred, on February 8th, that account made [another edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=prev&oldid=1138140309) reinstating most of the previous changes it had made, and although that was reverted within 10 minutes, Crewchief22 made [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=prev&oldid=1138144176) [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=next&oldid=1138144176) similar edits quickly afterward. After these were rolled back, Crewchief22 made [one more edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_West_(umpire\)&diff=prev&oldid=1138209674) changing the details of the incident between West and Torre, which as of now is still up. 

As this is just circumstantial evidence, it's fair to ask, ""How do we know this is Joe West, and not just a fan?"" (if fans of Joe West are a thing...) The first thing that clued me into this is the account's name; West was a crew chief, and as we can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/zeHkzlA.jpg), he wore #22 on his sleeve. However, the real clincher is [this edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crewchief22&diff=prev&oldid=1138141886), made by a logged-out editor on Crewchief22's talk page after they were warned to stop editing disruptively. It says, 

> I constructively corrected the bullshit that was on this page... there was never a shoving match between Joe torre and West... I should know - I was there. 

> And the Federal Court order MLB to reinstate the umpires, just as I wrote. 

> If you aren't going to leave my page alone, please remove it completely. I don't need anyone knowing anything about me ... and I certainly don't need anyone reading things that are not true. 

> Either reinstate what I wrote or erase the entire page .... I'm tired of correcting your lies. 

This post is signed ""Joe West"". I can honestly sympathize to some extent with what he's doing, especially the bit about his wife, but Wikipedia definitely isn't going to ""remove it completely"", and I have to believe there are better ways for him to spend his time! 

Edit 2: Also note the edit u/OliverHPerry describes in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10x5nzf/joe_west_is_spending_his_retirement_editing_his/j7rj1da/), which contains the comment about West's wife that I referred to without explaining (sorry!). 

Edit: Crewchief22 has now been blocked from editing for [making legal threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Crewchief22&oldid=1138268800). 

Edit 3: A Redditor who wishes to remain anonymous pointed out that the IP mentioned above geolocates to Lake County, Florida, [where West lives](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-sp-joe-west-0525-20210525-umvycksdlfexngnoqeb73u7qse-story.html). (TBF u/rafaelloaa noted this as well [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10x5nzf/joe_west_is_spending_his_retirement_editing_his/j7rnji3/).)

Edit 4: Actually, it looks like u/mosol_rei was the first to notice the IP thing [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10x5nzf/joe_west_is_spending_his_retirement_editing_his/j7qpt3r/). Also, u/paulz726 noticed that the email Crewchief22 posted on Wikipedia (since removed) is the same formerly listed on West's website [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222014032/http://www.umpirejoewest.com/feedback.htm). 

Edit 5: [Now confirmed](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10x5nzf/joe_west_is_spending_his_retirement_editing_his/j7xpie0/) - we did it, Reddit! 

Edit 6: Apparently u/Michael__Pemulis [emailed West](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10xtkxx/general_discussion_around_the_horn_2923/j7ue9wo/) and confirmed it as well.",sport

Long-time lurker first-time poster here. I want girls to think I'm tough so I tell them I'm an MMA fighter. I don't have any MMA experience though so I'm just wondering if someone can link a fight where you can't really see the fighters' faces. Preferably one where a skinny white guy KOs someone. 

My plan is to send the video to girls I like and tell them it's me. First I'll edit the footage so that it cuts straight to a dick pic right after the KO. That way, I'll get them at peak violence-arousal. 

I'll come back here to thank you guys when I'm doing the backstroke through vagina. Like ""Scrooge McDick"" as our Lord and savior Brandon Schaub would say.

Peace

MMA,The UFC is going to be remembered in history for a long time to come - for taking 80% of the revenue while their fighters suffer from CTE and lifelong injuries,"The recent post about Nam Phan apparently suffering from CTE was heartbreaking to see. It becomes straight up disturbing when you consider this:


>Unlike the vast majority of sports leagues and organizations, where athletes receive anywhere between 47-50% of the sport’s revenue, the UFC has historically paid out between 16-19% of revenues to its fighters. In 2019, the promotion reported $900m in revenue, but only 16% was paid out to the UFC’s approximately 600 fighters.

>[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/11/nba-players-are-making-a-fortune-from-nfts-ufc-fighters-may-not-be-so-lucky)

The UFC will be remembered as one of the most egregious examples of unchecked corporate greed in modern American history. Fighters are taking serious, irreversible brain damage while businessmen take the lion's share of the revenue without taking a single punch. People are going to look back decades later and wonder how the hell something like this was allowed to happen.

Is this the historical legacy that Dana White and the owners of the UFC want to leave for themselves?",sport

He killed off the Jedi until there were only 2 Jedi and 2 Sith, so balanced in a way. Or, in a different interpretation, this action distabilized the Force since the Sith had more control over the universe. The action that brought balance to the Force was when he, as Vader, killed Palpatine. As u/Sarahneth mentioned, he also brought balance to his pod racer as well, if we're being very literal.",humor

Showerthoughts,Telling a dangerously overweight person not to lose weight because they're beautiful is like telling an alcoholic not to stop drinking because they're fun.,"Disclaimer: being ""overweight"" doesn't matter to me and I don't hate people who are.

Edit: Thanks for the gold! I didn't expect this to be so popular.



Edit II: the point I'm trying to make is that in both cases it is wrong to encourage unhealthy behaviors under the guise of support or because you enjoy the effects of the dangerous behaviors. 

Not only that, but you're basically saying they aren't fun unless they drink and they aren't beautiful unless they're overweight.  You're completely disregarding their health and quality of life. Body positivity should mean you're beautiful no matter what size and we shouldn't equate ANY weight with beauty. Weight should be about health only. 

You also shouldn't be a jerk to someone because of their weight. ",humor

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

Jokes,Still my favorite joke I ever made up. :),"A monocle walks into a bar. After a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). He reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. ""Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke.""

So the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

The bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""Hey you two!"" he shouts. ""Stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",humor

Jokes,My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",humor

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Jokes,"8 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. I reposted it 4 years ago. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",humor

Jokes,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Jokes,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

The C.E.O says ""I'll be a waiter. All you do is carry food back and forth. This'll be a breeze"" so he is teleported to a restaurant. After about an hour, all the annoying customers drive him insane, so he smashes his plates on the ground and gives up.

The janitor says ""I'll be an artist"" so he is transported to an art facility. He glues all the classroom supplies and shattered plates to a canvas, then sells it for a billion dollars. The fairy asks the janitor how he was so clever.

The janitor says ""I got a masters degree in art.""

Jokes,[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,"A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""",humor
Jokes,An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar,"The first mathematician orders a beer

The second orders half a beer

""I don't serve half-beers"" the bartender replies

""Excuse me?"" Asks mathematician #2

""What kind of bar serves half-beers?"" The bartender remarks. ""That's ridiculous.""

""Oh c'mon"" says mathematician #1 ""do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play along""

""There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.""

""But that's not a problem"" mathematician #3 chimes in ""at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-""

""I know how limits work"" interjects the bartender

""Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics""

""Are you kidding me?"" The bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?""

""HE'S ON TO US"" mathematician #1 screeches

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.

The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. ""But wait"" he inturrupts, thinking fast, ""if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!""

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""How did you know that that would work?""

""It's simple really"" the bartender says. ""I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",humor

Music,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",entertainment

Music,"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and especially the music we all love.","Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels, stifling independent voices

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said. ""We care about our hosts’ development and we want their future to grow because of love—not loans.""",entertainment

Music,"Taylor Swift's private jets took 170 trips this year, landing her #1 on a new report that tracks the carbon emissions of celebrity private jets","Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/

As the world quite literally burns and floods, it’s important to remember that individualism won’t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint — among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let’s not even get started on yachts.)

While private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year — and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 

Drake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they’re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift’s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift’s plane flew today, July 29.)

“Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.”

To create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (“the world’s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,” according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for “radiative forcing,” which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas’ book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. 

Coming in behind Swift’s plane on Yard’s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay — the creative director for Puma — reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.

While Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, “We attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet’s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z’s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.”

The rest of the celebrities in Yard’s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it’s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can’t be using both at once.

So, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard’s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez’s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). 

Reps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard’s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for comment. 

As for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard’s study: Kylie Jenner’s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake’s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn’t do him any favors.

“This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics… nobody takes that flight,” Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for further comment.)",entertainment

Music,TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.,"(inb4 /r/TitleGore)

According to the website itself: Boil the Frog lets you create a playlist of songs that gradually takes you from one music style to another. It's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.

I'm using it right now for the first time, so I can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. I'll give an update if my ""from Maya Jane Coles to Boris"" mix actually worked out.

science,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

askscience,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

askscience,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",technology

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot. Please spread the word, and message me if you want to learn more or get involved. ",technology

***[PART 3 is here, since we hit the comment cap on this thread: https://reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/jv6f78/part_3_im_giving_away_an_iphone_12_promaxmini_to/]***

Hey,

I'm the guy who builds [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), an alternative iPhone app for Reddit that people on r/Apple have been really kind to in loving. I had a lot of fun working on the iOS 14 update with a ton of cool, customizable home screen Widgets, Picture in Picture video, and a bunch of other Reddit meets iOS 14 goodness, and now that all the new iPhones are out I wanted to celebrate it with a giveaway. (Who said those YouTubers get to have all the fun?)

I did this giveaway [last year for iOS 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/d7ejpn/im_giving_away_an_iphone_11_pro_to_a_commenter_at/) if some of you remember and everyone seemed to have a great time, so I figured making it an annual thing could be fun. ([Proof of winner](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/e085k1/apollo_iphone_giveaway_i_won/)) Plus the people who use Apollo are all super nice and give me awesome suggestions all the time for making it even better so consider it a thank you as well. 

# What Do I Win?

The winner gets their choice of any iPhone 12 model (Pro or non Pro, Max, normal sized or Mini) in any color and 128 GB capacity. Are you a BLUE person? RED? GOLD?! When this post is 24 hours old, at 11 PM GMT ([countdown](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+until+11+pm+gmt)), I'll post in r/ApolloApp who the winner is, I'll also DM you for details and people will probably spam you as well. 

# Rules

Simply check out this thread and comment and you're entered! Don't spam jibberish though please, and no multiple comments. If you're looking for an idea for a comment, tell me your favorite iPhone model of all time, or the first third party app you remember downloading. Account must have been created at the time of this post to prevent creating accounts just to enter. You do not have to download Apollo to enter, but it may give you extra luck who knows.

# Apollo? iOS 14 update?

Apollo is an alternative Reddit app for iOS with a focus on clean design and feeling right at home on iOS with a native design and adopting all the best, newest features, like Widgets, Picture in Picture video, super fast media viewer, and more. I started building it after finishing working at Apple in 2015 and have been working on it full time since. It's free to download and has over 100,000 five-star reviews, so [you should really check it out](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)! It's built solely by me, and I built it closely with community input to craft the best Reddit experience out there. 

Even if you're used to the official app, I think you'll really like the improvements Apollo offers to your browsing experience, even if it just [prevents you from getting Rick Roll'd](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/79jjlx/just_realized_that_apollo_has_built_in_rick_roll/). 

# Do you have any pets?

Yeah I have two cats named [Hugo](https://i.imgur.com/zlbhVQg.jpg) and [Ruby](https://i.imgur.com/uWU4Kfc.jpg). They're great, I also get to pet my neighbor's dog Leonard sometimes who is really cute. Sorry I don't have a picture of him but picture a big black shaggy dog.

# Thank You!

Seriously, have some fun and best of luck! My whole job exists thanks to the kindness of this subreddit and community, so thank you and I'll do my best to continue to impress you with some more sick updates. :) 

\- Christian

Hey!

I build a Reddit client for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). In a sentence, it's an iOS-focused Reddit app (not crossplatform, iOS only) that's an alternative to the official app with the goal of being speedy, comfortable to use, great media browsing, and just the best iOS has to offer in general. I loved Alien Blue, and wanted to build something as powerful and awesome as it, but with the goal of feeling even more like an iOS-first experience. [Here's a link](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)

I started working on Apollo right after I finished working at Apple in the summer of 2015, worked on it through 2017 when it finally got released, and it's been my full time job since.

I love that I can build such a fun and exciting app every day, and no bullshit, it's only because of the support of the Reddit Apple community that I've been able to. There's no ads, no investors, only optional support from you guys to sustain the app. It's built solely with the goal of making Redditors happy and I do my absolute best to be active in the community and base the app around its feedback.

So as a thank you, and to celebrate many sleepless nights working on the iOS 13 update that's now live, I wanted to do a lil giveaway open to anyone in the community. I'm not Unbox Therapy so it's not a pick up truck full of iPhones, but I thought giving away an iPhone 11 Pro (or Pro Max) could be a fun way to say thanks (or a regular iPhone 11 if that's what you want).

### How do I enter?

Just comment and you're entered. If you want something to comment about, uhh, help me name [the Apollo mascot](https://apolloapp.io). You have [24 hours](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+long+until+4+pm+september+22+2019+halifax%2C+nova+scotia+time).

### What do I win?

An iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max or regular 11 (maybe you want that nice red). 256GB. Color of your choice.

### Any rules?

Your Reddit account has to have been created before this thread was posted to prevent a bunch of duplicate accounts posting. Also I'll PM you if you win, you have 48 hours to respond to the PM (will go out Monday) or it'll go to the next person. All countries accepted so long as it's not impossible to get it to you.

### What's in Apollo's iOS 13 update?

Like I said Apollo's really focused on being the best iOS has to offer and really feeling at home on the platform. iOS 13 brought a bunch of really cool stuff, so I wanted to support as much of it as I could on day 1. So Apollo has support the (finally) system dark mode, the new haptic touch context menus, super fast launch times, there's Siri Shortcuts support so you can say [""normie garbage"" and have it open r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/90b66h/yo_is_apollo_gonna_support_siri_shortcuts/) or just build cool systems in the Shortcuts app in general. There's also multi-window support on iPad which is super cool. Hell, iOS 13 even supports PS4 and Xbox One controllers now so I added support for those. I really wanted to build something that didn't feel like a cross-platform, half Android /Material Design mixture, but instead feels like it was built from the ground up for iOS.

### Should I give Apollo a try? I don't mind the official app tbh

The official app's really cool, built by some super smart people, I even got to meet some of the engineers at WWDC this year. Utmost respect. It's kinda like a car though, you might use your car, it might get you from point A to point B fine, it's a solid enough car, why switch? Well, you might sit in a friend's car, find it just a bit more comfortable, maybe a bit speedier, sportier, appreciate some of the design choices better, and overall just find it a more enjoyable experience. Apollo Car has a really awesome media viewer, fast swipe gestures, speed, GIF scrubbing, a subreddit Jump Bar, really great comments view, and much more that you really have to see first hand. On top of this, in this analogy the competing car is free, [so why not try it](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575). :P 

Oh here's a quick album of screenshots I put together: https://imgur.com/a/UO2J10s (There's light mode too if you're into that!)

### I have an idea for your app!

Sick, that would make for a great comment, please do. :D I genuinely build the app solely planned around community feedback, so I'd greatly appreciate it!

apple,I Fought Apple and Won.,"I purchased an iPhone XS in September of last year. The first week of December I accidentally dropped it in my sisters swimming pool at the shallow end - a depth of approximately 1.10m. Immediately, I jumped in an pulled the phone out, switched it off and let it dry for a few hours (as indicated in the steps of what to do when your phone gets wet on the Apple website). A few hours later I turned the phone back on and all was good. Fantastic! 

A few weeks later, the Sunday before Christmas, my phone started bugging out restarting itself every 3-5 minutes. I restore it to an old backup from June 2018 to no avail, I restored it as a new iPhone which seemed to work. 

Jump forward 4 days and it starts happening again. I go through the process once more. It seems to be working fine for now. I was at my parents place for a week over Christmas so I wasn’t able to get to an Apple store until around the 29th. 

I went in and explained what happened to the genius tech, told her that it seems to be working fine now though. She agreed it may have just been a software issue, but made a case note so if it happened again then they would know it’s got a history. 

Jump forward another 2 weeks and it starts happening again, this time worse. The restarting is less frequent, maybe once every 8 minutes, but the screen is flickering from bright green to dark green. I take it back to Apple and they say they need to open it up and see if there is any internal damage. 

Two hours later I come back and they say the Liquid Contact Indicators have been activated, which means there is internal liquid damage and they won’t cover liquid damage under warranty. 

I spoke with the store manager on duty for about 45 minutes because I disagreed with this policy given Phil Schiller, head of worldwide marketing for Apple, literally said [you can drop it in the pool and it will be fine (jump to 40:40)](https://youtu.be/wFTmQ27S7OQ). It was not fine. This was the only time my phone had been in or near water. 

I continued the conversation with the store duty manager and she said the best she can do is take 25% off the replacement handset price of AUD$800 (or close to it). I was not about to pay an additional $600 for my phone after paying $1600 for it not too long ago. 

She gave me a few other options but the outcome of those would most likely be no replacement due to liquid damage. 

I was completely honest with her and said “I understand this isn’t  you making the policy, but I feel misled and like there is a bit of false advertising going on here. You can’t just make a statement and then choose not to cover it under warranty” she apologised again and I said that’s fine, I understand it’s not her. I told her I would be filing a complaint with NSW Fair Trading (consumer protection department in my state) because of the misleading statements made by Apple. She said that’s good and she hopes I get the outcome I want. 

I file the complaint. It goes to a complaints and compliance officer named Sharron (thanks, Sharron!). I spoke with Sharon today and she told me Apple Australia passed her through 6 different people before the complaint ended up on the desk of the Vice President of Executive Relations at Apple Australia. This woman conceded in agreeing to replace my phone at no additional charge. 

Sharron said that in situations like this large companies will replace the item in the hopes that the consumer won’t make a scene. But I’m making a scene, because I beat Apple and their shitty selective warranty clauses. 

I’m glad Australia has strong consumer protections laws that we have because there is no way in hell I would be paying an addition $600 for my phone. No phone is worth AUD$2200. 

And for any other Australians here who feel like they’ve been slighted by Apple and their selective warranty clauses then I suggest you gather your evidence and lodge an official complaint. 

**edit** 
I have no ill will towards Apple. I love their products. I have a Watch, an iMac, a MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and a very old unused iPad. 

I just didn’t agree with their bullshit policy. Don’t make a claim if you aren’t going to cover it when things go wrong. Yes, I understand that the seal can degrade over time, but 6 weeks? Come on. 

**double edit**
All of you commenting and private messaging me saying

>> it’s water-resistant not water-proof. 

Cool. Thanks. I fucking get it. Did I once say I thought my phone was water-proof? No. I understand IP ratings are for resistance levels not proofing levels. 

The whole crux of my argument is that the WORLDWIDE HEAD OF MARKETING FOR APPLE said “dropped your phone in the pool? No problem just pull it out and it’s ok” 

They claim water-**resistance** for up to 2m for 30 minutes.

Move along. 

**triple edit**
This blew up far bigger than I had ever anticipated it would. 

Everyone messaging me telling me I’m a crying baby, a moron, a dickhead who doesn’t know when to back down, and whatever else, please keep it coming. You fuel my internal fire for justice and vindication. 

The simple fact is that Apple have claimed in their advertising and through public statements by their senior executive staff that the phone can withstand the conditions my phone experienced. 

Now, was my phone defective since leaving this factory? Who knows. If so, I can accept that this is a very rare occurrence, and happily take my replacement. 

Did I some how break the *internal* water seal in the 6 weeks I owned the phone which then caused this problem? Who knows, maybe. If that *is* what has happened here then Apple need to look at how they’re sealing the phones so something as simple as everyday use of the phone doesn’t cause the seal to be breached as easily. 

**quadruple edit**
Thanks for the gold everyone. I don’t need it. Donate to a charity. 

Everyone saying I’m an idiot for continuing to buy Apple products, I’ll have you know I have had zero warranty issues with Apple previously. If I have ever needed something replaced or repaired they have always covered me for no additional cost (even without Apple Care). 

All of the Apple products I own have been purchased over the last 8 years. And to be perfectly honest, I’ll probably buy more in the future as the need arises. ",technology

Just leave a comment to enter! 🎉📱","# UPDATE: Winner has been announced! https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/xwjpof/apollos_iphone_14_pro_giveaway_winner_has_been/

**This thread has hit the 100K Reddit comment limit, comment on this new thread now:  https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/xu8zct/part_2_hey_developer_of_apollo_for_reddit_here_im/**

Hey all,

Years back I worked at Apple, and now I took what I learned there and build an app for Reddit called Apollo. It's a free alternative to the official app, built specifically for iOS (almost like if Apple created their own Reddit app), with lots of customizability, and being built in the open with community feedback. 

Download link: https://apps.apple.com/app/id979274575

I worked my butt off this summer so you'd have a Reddit app with all the best iOS 16 features on day 1:

- A ton of awesome Lock Screen Widgets for Reddit, so you can keep tabs on your favorite subreddits, or how your posts are doing, total distance scrolled, etc. right from your lock screen
- Live Text analysis, similar so the Photos app you can now directly select, share, and translate text just by selecting text in pics and videos in Apollo
- Subreddit weather for hundreds of subreddits, so when you go to one you can see the weather there, as well as the local time!
- Scroll Distance Tracker, so as you use Apollo you get live stats on how many miles you've scrolled in total, synced between all your devices, with comparisons to common distances like the height of Mount Everest, or 48 Shaquille O'Neals, and you can even set distance goals like a true athlete!
- Pixel Pals, so if you have an iPhone 14 Pro, you can have [a little Tamagotchi-style buddy above the Dynamic Island](https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1570863225234923520) while you browse Reddit, and even if you don't have the newest iPhone, you can pin them to your Lock Screen as a widget!
- More fun Dynamic Island stuff to come!

Really proud of this update, so to celebrate it I wanted to do like I've done in the past, and have an iPhone 14 Pro giveaway! Just leave a comment (no spam pls) and you're entered, and I'll draw the winner in 24 hours.

apple,"Introducing Apollo, a brand new Reddit experience for iOS. Gorgeous, iOS centric design, an incredible Media Viewer, fully customizable gestures, a full Markdown editor, and sculpted by thousands of Redditors.","Hey!

For the last almost three years, I've been developing a brand new Reddit app for iOS called Apollo. I used to work at Apple, and since then I took what I learned and built Apollo from the ground up to look and feel like a gorgeous Reddit experience that is distinctly iOS, following the design guidelines Apple put forth, to almost envision what Reddit would look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app, with all the power, speed and flexibility you could possibly want.

**Trailer:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKbPZVDg-Z8

I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/) a few years back, and literally thousands of awesome Redditors joined the beta program to help sculpt the best Reddit experience possible and form Apollo into what it is today. So much of the feedback fundamentally transformed Apollo beyond what I could have done or foreseen myself.

It's available for download for free, and I'd love for you all to check it out if you have the chance (and send me feedback over in r/ApolloApp if you have any!). Fundamentally, I focused on giving it a gorgeous iOS design, with a really powerful Media Viewer, incredible comments experince, a full Markdown editor, fully customizable gestures, and so much more. It's insanely powerful, while also maintaining a really clean, simple design.

Again, your feedback would be monumental. This is just the beginning for Apollo, and really hope I can keep building onto it for a long time coming with even more incredible features.

### Questions

##### Why build it? There's already Reddit apps.
While there are some nice ones, nothing exactly scratched my itch as to what a Reddit client could really achieve on iOS. Alien Blue came close, but still had a UI that especially once iOS 7 launched felt outdated and somewhat out of place on iOS. Android also has some really great clients, but I just think the experience on iOS has been lacking and is due for something to really show what Reddit on iOS can be. I built Apollo with the goal of not just being the best Reddit experience on iOS, but the best Reddit experience *period*.

##### What's wrong with the official Reddit app?
Nothing, if you're happy, great! Reddit has a lot of really smart people on it. For me, however, I'm not a fan of how they're trying to get one central look across iOS and Android, I really think an iOS app should look and feel like an iOS app, and an Android app should respect Material Design. I think designing for the middle results in a clunky experience where the potential of both platforms is never realized to the fullest. Apollo is an iOS app period, built to take advantage of iOS features and feel like a beautiful, familiar iOS app. I also think they discontinued Alien Blue without incorporating the best parts of it that people loved the most, such as the minimal, uncluttered UI (Alien Blue was much more compact and concise), as well as powerful features like swipe to collapse comments, full screen, inline previews for links in comments, etc. Apollo has all that and more, because I think it's essential part of browsing on iOS.

##### I'm still using Alien Blue, why use Apollo?
I can say without question Alien Blue was an incredible app, I loved it. But it's very clearly not being taken care of anymore. If you plan to get an iPhone X, it won't even display properly and will have black bars at the top. For everyone else, it's simply not getting updates or being maintained properly, and it's obviously got worse and worse. Imgur links don't work that well anymore, Reddit's own content links certainly don't, more and more things are stopping loading. Lots of new features of Reddit are missing (and even some old goodies, like multireddits) too. I really built Apollo with the power of Alien Blue in mind, I think if you're a fan of Alien Blue you'll feel right at home in Apollo.

##### It's free? How do you make money/expect it to survive?
I more or less just copied how Alien Blue did it, where it's free to download and use forever (with no ads), and you can unlock a ""Pro"" version in the app for $2.99 that unlocks some extra features like submitting posts (same as Alien Blue did), automatic dark mode, customizing gestures, customizing the app icon, and a bunch more. I mean, I'd love to give out everything for free, but I can't afford to compete with a billion dollar company like Reddit. I'm just one guy in an apartment with an awesome girlfriend and [two cute cats](https://i.imgur.com/7dKJs2n.jpg), and obviously need some form of revenue in the app to sustain me being able to build the app at all and give it a healthy future. Choosing *which* features to include in Pro is obviously hard, but I thought Alien Blue [set a good standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1i2fe4/im_trying_to_convince_a_friend_to_get_pro/) with its unlockable features, which allowed it to have a healthy, long-ish life. I hope that's understandable, I just really want to be able to keep building onto this app for a long time coming.

##### Does it have ads?
No, no ads anywhere.

##### iPad app?
Yep, it's a universal app! I have awesome plans to really bring it further and to the next level on iPads as well.

##### Available everywhere?
Yes! International, baby!

##### What are your plans for Apollo for the future?
A lot. :) I have a ton of things I want to build for Apollo, from an even better, super-powered iPad app, to even more powerful content filtering, more moderator features, full comment search, etc. My plan is to have users vote on which features they want to see the most, and I'll work on those, so it'll become even more of a Reddit app for Redditors, by Redditors.

If you have any more I'm more than happy to answer them! I'll be at my keyboard all day until I've answered everything or my wrists fall off. EDIT: Oh boy, you all are hard to keep up with. I will answer every question though if it takes me weeks!

apple,"So... Apollo made $5,087.23 yesterday. Yeah no joke. Just sent it to the local animal shelter. THANK YOU SO MUCH! (Animal pics inside)","Yeah that was one hell of a way to wake up.

Long story short yesterday [I made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/953nqz/i_built_the_apollo_reddit_client_and_im_donating/) saying I'll donate all the proceeds from my [Apollo Reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) for the day to our local SPCA animal shelter (an awesome Canadian non-profit, no-kill shelter) because they said they were really low on supplies and well cats and dogs are awesome and need our help. I wanted to make a donation but I figured the awesome Apple/Reddit community might want to get in on that and give them something for it in the process so I made a post about it and sweet mayonnaise did you guys ever.

$5,087.23 is the total amount raised. Yeah seriously I'm not joking, I wanted to raise like a few hundred bucks but 5 freaking grand is just absurdly beyond what I thought. All the amounts below are in Canadian dollars at today's exchange rate because most things came in in US dollars and it's a Canadian charity.

### Breakdown

- $4,038.55 in proceeds from Apollo sales. 
- $500 ($653.16 CAD) approximately from a ton of [direct donations](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298), hard to keep track but going off of a general tally from the comments and PMs I received I can honestly say I think that's undershooting the amount donated directly if anything 
- $50 worth of bitcoin donated ($65.31 CAD)
- $25 from a kind friend
- Someone awesomely gave me Reddit gold so I'll donate that too ($5.21 CAD)

That brings the total to approximately $4,787.23 but I really wanted that over $5,000 (plus there's some still some people commenting here and there about donating through Apollo even though the day's over and I want their money to count) I'll throw in another $300 of my own for a clean total of $5,087.23.

### Proof

As I stated around $500 ($653.16 CAD) of that total was donated directly to the charity (not through Apollo) from some amazing people so they already have those funds awesomely, so the amount remaining is $5,087.23 - $653.16 which is $4,434.07.

I wanted to try to figure out the best way to donate that, so I [posted asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/95c0cs/if_i_theoretically_had_about_5000_to_donate_to/) and then called their fundraising line to make sure and they said it would be best to donate it directly, which makes a lot of sense.

Of course it would have been cool to throw open the doors of the shelter with $5,000 worth of pet food and music playing but the goal is the animals (and not to be flashy) and fact is they can do a lot more with that money directly than through one of us buying stuff (bulk supply discounts, they can put it exactly where needed, etc.) so I donated it directly per their advice and now they can do the best possible things with it to help out the kitties and puppies and turtles and rabbits and whatnot of Nova Scotia. :)

- Proof 1 from online form: https://i.imgur.com/katRyYv.png
- Proof 2 from confirmation email: https://i.imgur.com/VWy46Ja.png
- Proof 3 from bank account: https://i.imgur.com/sa7L7r7.png
- Proof 4 from thank you email from them (wow!): https://i.imgur.com/WcGmh7Y.png

If you need more proof and can think of a way to provide it please just say so.

### Pics

A bunch of people were curious to see pics of the animals in need so we stopped over on my girlfriend's lunch break and took some pics for y'all. It's the same shelter [we got both of our cute fuzzballs from too](https://i.imgur.com/IaZqLDm.jpg).

Here's an album of a bunch of the pics (it was really hot out so I couldn't take any of the dogs out for a walk to take some pics they're really cute and I took a pic of the adoption board): 

Album of cute animals animals at the shelter: https://imgur.com/a/kYEoI5y

### Thank You

Seriously everyone thank you so much. It honestly blew me away, I was hoping for a small something but I really think this is going to make a massive difference to a lot of needy animals, y'all are the best. And if anyone missed the chance yesterday and still want to you can donate directly to them here: https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298 Or even just to your local shelter, they surely need the help as well! My two little furballs thank you too.

Definitely won't be the last time I do this with Apollo, I'll try to do something like this again someday since it went so well. :D Anyway, back to work (and obligatory if you wanna check out a cool Reddit app check out [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)!)

If you have any questions or anything too I'm happy to answer.

apple,The Apple Watch feature I once thought was a throwaway novelty is now crucial to me.,"Not sure how many people frequently use the digital touch heartbeat on their Apple Watch, but I wasn't one of them until a month ago. I bought my Apple Watch when it first came out, and my wife and I exchanged heartbeat messages maybe two or three times and then never used it again. Last month, my sister passed away from a rare form of cancer. While she was on her deathbed, my wife suggested taking her pulse with my Watch, just to see how she was doing internally. I gently rested the watch on her wrist, took the pulse, and, in the process, remembered the heartbeat feature. I sent her heartbeat to myself, so I could easily keep track of where it was. She passed away a few hours later. Today, whenever I need to feel as though she's with me, I just bring up that heartbeat and let it pulse. I wanted to share this with fellow Apple enthusiasts, as a use case I never thought about when I bought my watch, and one I hope you'll remember going forward if you're ever in a similar situation.

TL;DR my sister passed away and I use the digital touch heartbeat to keep her with me.

Edit: I had some people asking what kind of cancer (and others pointing out the potential to raise awareness), so I'll share it here. She had Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary Hypercalcemic. My family was told it affects 1% of women in the world, but I don't have the link to back that up. If you want to donate to something that helps people in her situation, consider [The Ballard House](https://www.theballardhouse.org) (They provided my sister with temporary housing while she was going through radiation treatments), or any cancer-fighting/support non-profit.",technology

She instantly said ""Well you should have had a case."" That's the same kinda crap that people here and other places say any time there is any kind of crap design choice Apple makes. It's down right infuriating to hear. The front glass of the iPhone X hasn't scratched at all from going in and out of my pocket. So they clearly CAN put glass on the back that would protect from that. The Apple Watch uses a higher grade coating on it's stainless steel which is why it won't begin to shed, or possibly never will. Me not using a case isn't an excuse when Apple already uses stronger methods on other products and sometimes on the same product. For a $1000 phone. 

I saw the same thing about BendGate and some people STILL refuse to admit that the phone's were structurally compromised. My 6 bend from just being in my front pocket. I replaced the rear case and that one ALSO bent. People gave shit to JerryRigEverything for showing how easily the new iPad Pro bent. I will agree that the iPad Pro is a bit more of an edge case but how easily some people are to just blame those that have issues for not using a case is just insane. These are $1000+ devices.

apple,"I'm a former Apple engineer and I build the Apollo Reddit client! Today for my birthday I'm donating 100% of Apollo's proceeds to my SPCA Animal Shelter who really need the help. If you've ever had a passing interest in Apollo (or even already have it, secrets inside) there's no better day! 🐶🐱","EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!

Hey r/Apple!

I'm decently active in this community, but for those of you who I haven't said hi to, I'm an iOS app developer, I used to work at Apple and now for the last several years I've built [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), an awesome Reddit app for iOS that I built with the goal of ""what would it look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app?"". 

### What's going on today?

Today it's my 27th birthday, and I want to raise a bunch of money for the SPCA Animal Shelter and a bunch of animals that are going through some rough times. Heck, I want to go a step further and break the all-time single day donation record. **So for today, 100% of Apollo's proceeds are going to the SPCA.**

If you buy literally anything in the app like Apollo Pro, I'll donate 100% of the proceeds to the SPCA, so it's a great day if you even have a passing interest in Apollo. If you already have unlocked things in Apollo, boy do I have a treat for you! A lot of people have been asking for an ""animals/pets"" style homescreen icon option for Apollo, and today I released a ""stealth update"" that has an all new SPCA themed icon commissioned by the absolutely incredible [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/). It's so gorgeous, [I love how it turned out](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png). Not only today, but literally for every day forever, 100% of the proceeds for this will go to the SPCA. You get the icon, some wallpapers, and even an exclusive Apollo Community Pets Photo Album included. There's even another Easter egg if you unlock it. 

If you want to go the direct route instead (or in addition) that would be amazing too! I created a direct fundraiser page: https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/apollo-app-2020-spca-fundraiser/ This is doubly awesome if you have an employer who donation-matches to charities. Seriously, I know a lot of people are like ""hurr durr every dollar counts"" but no bullshit, it **really** does here. Think of the size of this community, 1.6 million people. If even a small percentage of them gave a single dollar we could make a massive difference. 

### What's an ""Apollo""? It's a different Reddit app?

If you're happy with the official app and have no idea what Apollo is, that's totally cool. I wasn't really perfectly happy with any of the iOS Reddit app offerings out there (especially with Alien Blue's passing). The official app in particular (while built by some insanely smart people whom I have a ton of respect for) I think tries to toe the line between a single experience across their Android and an iOS apps more than I like, so I really wanted to create an iOS-first Reddit experience that felt at home on iOS, built for speed, power features, and insanely great media consumption. It's free to download and use!

It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer, Smart Portrait Lock, and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/24/apollo) as well as [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/), with over 2 million downloads and over 100K 5-star reviews.

### Why right now?

These warm months are dubbed ""[kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/)"" by shelters, because it's the time of the year that all the cats like to give birth. So the shelters get a sudden massive influx of a ton of orphaned and surrendered (and sometime left to die) kittens and it massively drains their resouces like food. This is amplified by the COVID pandemic where a lot less people have been able to gets their pets neutered, and adoptions have lessened due to people staying inside. So it's a really, really hard time of the year and they (and the animals they're helping) are really in need of the help.

They're also special for me because it's where I rescued my two cats. Pet tax photo album: https://imgur.com/a/q9cL7t6

So yeah, if you enjoy my work at all, or like animals at all, or want me to have a good birthday, or just want some happiness in this otherwise crappy year, it would really mean the world to me if you could check out any of the above links and help out the shelter. The donation record for a single day [is $27,355 that we set last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cg11x7/i_dont_even_know_how_to_title_this_typing_from/), but I really really want to beat it this year! I think with the combination of the new icon, Apollo having more users than ever, and the direct donation option, we can do it.

I'll of course keep you all posted once I find out how much Apollo raised by tomorrow! In the meantime I'd love to hang around and talk if you have any questions or insights or just want to share pet pics haha.

\- Christian

EDIT: Only a few hours left! When this post turns 24 hours old the donations will be totaled! If you're considering Apollo now is the perfect time! 9:30 AM PT is the time mark! Thank you so much everyone!

Android,Chinese Spyware Pre-Installed on All Samsung Phones (& Tablets),"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.",technology

Android,"I hope Pokémon GO will stay around for years to come. Not because of the game, but because it demands a good battery.","A notable amount of people already bought new phones just because they wanted to get to play Pokémon GO, so that's something.

But the thing is: that shit requires a good battery. My 3 year old S4 drains its self empty really quickly if I keep the game open while walking, and I know that's an issue with newer phones aswell. The big difference between Pokémon and other mobile games is that you'll play the game in places with no way to recharge your phone, and you often play for extended durations at once (instead of just log in, 2 min taptaptap, turn off).

Now in theory, if someone plays that game and is going to buy a new phone, it's more likely that they'll add ""need a really good battery"" on their list of ""features I want""... and as such, in the long run, phones with great batteries will sell more.

Which will, hopefully, lead to companies spending more time developing battery technologies since it's now a bigger selling point than before.

Or maybe they'll just start marketing portable chargers for Pokémon players and nothing else happens because the players will already have their extra battery with that, and they don't need a better phone battery anymore.

I don't really know what I'm talking about, just a showerthought.

TL;DR Pokémon drains battery. Players will buy more phones that have good battery. Companies start focusing more on battery power.",technology

>YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO. I'm not trying to take risks with my Google account that I've been using for over a decade, and I doubt others want to either. Sorry if that's ""misleading"".",technology

Android,How Apple removing the charging port scares me as an Android user,"Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it. Otherwise, there is a high chance history will repeat itself.",technology

Android,My Galaxy S7 Edge exploded last night.,"Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/0EtwkRU

I had it in my back pocket before taking it out to take a picture, but it froze and shut down. After trying and failing to turn it back on for a minute or so, I put it down on my countertop and figured I'll just try again later. Literally no more than a couple seconds after putting it down the whole thing spontaneously went up in flames. I had a couple nearby towels catch fire too, thought my kitchen was gonna burn down for a moment.

I took the phone to Samsung's local customer service this morning and was told nothing can be done since I bought it two years ago and it's no longer under warranty. I'm glad I'm safe and all I lost was the phone considering how close I came to getting severe burns, but I'm pretty bummed. This was an expensive phone that I expected to last me longer, and certainly didn't expect to almost start a fire at my place. 

I contacted them on twitter, but I don't really expect anything considering how bad customer service is in Morocco. I loved my S7E and my previous Galaxy phones, but I think I'm kinda done with Samsung after this.

e: a word

Edit: Samsung support USA got in touch on twitter and requested some info. I'm not sure what can be done considering where I am, but I'm glad someone at least reached out. I'll update if there's any news.

Edit 2: I got a call at work from Samsung Morocco this morning. They apologized and said the issue should have been better handled by the store, and that they'll be back in touch later today. I went back to the store to see if they'd salvaged my microSD and sim card (tray slot is stuck) and was told they also got a call about the issue and the device will likely be sent in for investigation.

Edit 3: Hi guys. I got another call asking me to drop by the store to sign some paperwork and pick up an S9. The lady over the phone sounded genuinely apologetic about the whole incident, I was relieved and thought you know what, it took some pressure, but they came through and maybe we can start mending this relationship. I get to the store and I'm presented with a document to sign that requires me to delete all social media posts about this without delay and cease all further comments. This is doubly disappointing. My conscience isn't worth $900, so I guess this is it. Thanks everyone who helped me get my issue heard.

Android,"The new step by step guide detailing how to get started developing Android apps, with no prior experience necessary. Includes every resource I used, simple explanations and an interesting first app tutorial. Everything you need to get started in Android Development is here.","A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I’m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience.
 
[Here is a link to the old post, in case you’re interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1w3woc/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and/)
 
##There are two ways of approaching this post:

1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you’ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.
2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills.
 
**What is Java?**
 
Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable. 
 
**Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language**
 
This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.
For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:
 
    String name = ""Dennis"";
 
    String surname = ""Cometti"";
 
    String FullName = name + "" "" + surname;
 
 
After this runs, the variable FullName will equal “Dennis Cometti”.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0).
 
I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)

Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a ‘Quote’ Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person.
 
**A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English**
 
All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:
 
    String name = ""DENNIS"";
 
    name = name.toLowerCase();
 
 
It couldn’t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted “DENNIS” (""dennis"") to the 'name' variable.
After you have typed ‘name.’ Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance.
 
**Classes, methods and objects in Java**
 
•     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain “Dennis” and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89.
 
•     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView.
 
•     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car.
 
•     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects.
 
**So what is the difference between classes and objects?**
 
A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car).
 
A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be a ‘name’ (containing the String “Dennis”).
 
If you are confused, don’t worry, once you have followed the instructions you’ll understand it much clearer.

##How do you get started making an app? 
 
**Get Android Studio**

Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don’t let the words confuse you – it’s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You’ll come across many things you don’t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn’t need them for this exercise).
 
#Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don’t open it yet.]( https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 
**Strings in Android**

Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.
[Here’s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html)
 
**How Android Studio works**

Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won’t be using many. When you create a new ‘Project’ (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.
[This screenshot shows what it generates](http://i.imgur.com/HOX9B7S.png)
This looks quite complex but it’s actually quite simple. For example the ‘layout’ folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you’ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.
 
 
 
 
 
#####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.

>

 
#Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button.

 
#Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http://imgur.com/a/o7NdR)

 
#Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http://imgur.com/JM4BIMV.png)

 
#Instruction #6:
The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http://pastebin.com/pRisAsPF

This has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from “Tap the screen to begin” to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color.
 
#Instruction #7:
Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http://imgur.com/a/3I7v9

You’ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.
You will see ‘public class Quote{}’, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http://pastebin.com/VhHbWwSN 
Just click OK to any popup boxes.

What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you ‘instantiate’ the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon.
 
#Instruction #8:
Click on the Quotebook class here: http://i.imgur.com/bG2d0VD.png
Then copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http://pastebin.com/wz8gbWWA

You’ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable/line: int count = 0;

This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http://pastebin.com/3FXi14XZ
 
 
 
 
 
#Explanation time!
 
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);
 
    RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);
    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);
    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);
 
 
The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.

____________________


     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();
 
     Quote quote1 = new Quote(""You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck."", ""Troy Barnes"");
     quoteList.add(quote1);
 
     Quote quote2 = new Quote(""Cool Beans"", ""Rod Kimble"");
     quoteList.add(quote2);
 
 
The first line here creates an Array/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called ‘quoteList’.
 
The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person’s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.

____________________


This is where it gets a little tricky:
 
    touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
 
                if (count < quoteList.size()) {
 
                   Quote q = quoteList.get(count);
                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());
                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());
 
                   count = count + 1;
 
                } else{
 
                    count = 0;
 
           }}});
 
 
This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.

*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.
If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*

If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.
 
 
 
#Instruction #9:
Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled ‘values’ and ‘values-v21’, they should both contain a file called styles.xml
In the ‘values’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar""
 
In the ‘values-v21’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar""
 
This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes.

To do this next step, you have to:
- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed.
 
- [Enable Developer Settings](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2457986/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging.
 
- Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio/ADB)
 
Then, you have to click the [green play button](http://i.imgur.com/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app!
 
If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers/android studio.

**Libraries**
 
Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.
For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.
There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.
 
Android Arsenal is a great site for finding Android Libraries:
https://android-arsenal.com/
 
And here is how to add them to Android Studio:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16588064/how-do-i-add-a-library-project-to-the-android-studio
 
 
**More advanced Pro-Tips**
 
- Stack Overflow is a fantastic community if you have any development questions - but Google it first.
- Check out /r/androiddev
- Follow Google Design Guidelines.
- If you don't really understand some code or how to do a particular task, Google it, comment what you are trying to do and ask around.
- Use libraries wherever you can.

Android,The direction Google is heading in is frustrating as a consumer,"Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. 

The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.

Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. 

Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just ""guidelines"" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. 

I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. /rant

Android,"Samsung ""space zoom"" moon shots are fake, and here is the proof","**This post has been updated with several additional experiments in newer posts, which address most comments and clarify what exactly is going on:**

**[UPDATE 1](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11p7rqy/update_to_the_samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are/)**

**[UPDATE 2](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11r7dwk/last_update_on_the_samsung_moon_controversy_and/)**

Original post:

Many of us have witnessed the breathtaking moon photos taken with the latest zoom lenses, starting with the S20 Ultra. Nevertheless, I've always had doubts about their authenticity, as they appear almost too perfect. While these images are not necessarily outright fabrications, neither are they entirely genuine. Let me explain.

There have been many threads on this, and many people believe that the moon photos are real ([inputmag](https://www.inverse.com/input/reviews/is-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-using-ai-to-fake-detailed-moon-photos-investigation-super-resolution-analysis)) - even MKBHD has claimed [in this popular youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6P1VRs68Cqo) that the moon is not an overlay, like Huawei has been accused of in the past. But he's not correct. So, while many have tried to prove that Samsung fakes the moon shots, I think nobody succeeded - until now.

**WHAT I DID**

1) I downloaded this high-res image of the moon from the internet - https://imgur.com/PIAjVKp

2) I downsized it to 170x170 pixels and applied a gaussian blur, so that all the detail is GONE. This means it's not recoverable, the information is just not there, it's digitally blurred: https://imgur.com/xEyLajW

And a 4x upscaled version so that you can better appreciate the blur: https://imgur.com/3STX9mZ

3) I full-screened the image on my monitor (showing it at 170x170 pixels, blurred), moved to the other end of the room, and turned off all the lights. Zoomed into the monitor and voila - https://imgur.com/ifIHr3S

4) This is the image I got - https://imgur.com/bXJOZgI

**INTERPRETATION**

To put it into perspective, here is a side by side: https://imgur.com/ULVX933

In the side-by-side above, I hope you can appreciate that Samsung is leveraging an AI model to put craters and other details on places which were just a blurry mess. **And I have to stress this**: there's a difference between additional processing a la super-resolution, when multiple frames are combined to recover detail which would otherwise be lost, and this, where you have a specific AI model trained on a set of moon images, in order to recognize the moon and slap on the moon texture on it (when there is no detail to recover in the first place, as in this experiment). This is not the same kind of processing that is done when you're zooming into something else, when those multiple exposures and different data from each frame account to something. This is specific to the moon.

**CONCLUSION**

The moon pictures from Samsung are fake. Samsung's marketing is deceptive. It is adding detail where there is none (in this experiment, it was intentionally removed). In [this article](https://mspoweruser.com/fake-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-moon-shots-debunked/), they mention multi-frames, multi-exposures, but the reality is, it's AI doing most of the work, not the optics, the optics aren't capable of resolving the detail that you see. Since the moon is tidally locked to the Earth, it's very easy to train your model on other moon images and just slap that texture when a moon-like thing is detected. 
 
Now, Samsung does say ""No image overlaying or texture effects are applied when taking a photo, because that would cause similar objects to share the same texture patterns if an object detection were to be confused by the Scene Optimizer."", which might be technically true - you're not applying any texture if you have an AI model that applies the texture as a part of the process, but in reality and without all the tech jargon, that's that's happening. It's a texture of the moon.

If you turn off ""scene optimizer"", you get the actual picture of the moon, which is a blurry mess (as it should be, given the optics and sensor that are used). 

To further drive home my point, I blurred the moon even further and clipped the highlights, which means the area which is above 216 in brightness gets clipped to pure white - there's no detail there, just a white blob - https://imgur.com/9XMgt06

I zoomed in on the monitor showing that image and, guess what, again you see slapped on detail, even in the parts I explicitly clipped (made completely 100% white): https://imgur.com/9kichAp

**TL:DR**
Samsung is using AI/ML (neural network trained on 100s of images of the moon) to recover/add the texture of the moon on your moon pictures, and while some think that's your camera's capability, it's actually not. And it's not sharpening, it's not adding detail from multiple frames because in this experiment, all the frames contain the same amount of detail. None of the frames have the craters etc. because they're intentionally blurred, yet the camera somehow miraculously knows that they are there. And don't even get me started on the motion interpolation on their ""super slow-mo"", maybe that's another post in the future..

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes (and awards), I really appreciate it! If you want to follow me elsewhere (since I'm not very active on reddit), here's my IG: [@ibreakphotos](https://www.instagram.com/ibreakphotos/)

**EDIT2 - IMPORTANT**: New test - I photoshopped one moon next to another (to see if one moon would get the AI treatment, while another not), and managed to coax the AI to do exactly that.

This is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons: https://imgur.com/kMv1XAx

I replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this: https://imgur.com/RSHAz1l

As you can see, one moon got the ""AI enhancement"", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor.",technology

Android,'Swiping' to delete a song is ruining my Google Play Music experience,"EDIT: Here's a better example: https://streamable.com/l6hvq

I know I don't scroll 100% vertically but I don't think anybody does. Doing the same in other apps does not result in 'ghost swipes' like this. Also, notice how the last ""undo"" button disappears really quickly.

We all know that the google Play Music Android app is not very aesthetically pleasing or very user friendly but you can get used to these things and I have done so over the past 3 years.

However, there is one thing that is now making the app even more annoying: You can swipe songs to delete them from playlists - at it is very easy to do so without trying.

I can't remember how long this has been going on but I can say that I've deleted a bunch of songs from playlists without know which song it was. And exactly this happened right before I decided to record this video. The 'undo' button disappears as soon as you touch anywhere else on the screen so when you're quickly scrolling through a playlist this happens very often.

Here's an example of how you can scroll quickly through the playlist you've created and accidentally delete songs:

https://streamable.com/wz9h9

I compare it with another app, 'Relay for reddit', where you can also swipe left or right on tiles to do an action. 
In Relay you don't get accidental swipes left or right like you do in the Google Play Music app. How hard is it to fix this, Google?

Edit: I know the video isn't the best example but I was being a little cautious since I didn't actually want to delete any songs because it's a hassle to find them again sometimes.

And while I'm adding to the post I want to let you know that I just deleted a song because I wanted to scroll all the way down to the bottom of one of my playlists 😢",technology

Android,"NFC is the most Underrated technology on planet earth, and I blame apple","I remember being super mind-blown by NFC tags when I got my galaxy S3 many years ago. I thought, ""This is going to be the future! Everything is going to use NFC!"". Years later, it's still very rarely actually used in the real world aside from payments. I was thinking to myself, ""Why dont routers come with NFC stickers for pairing your devices? Why don't car phone mounts come with NFC for connecting your phone to your car stereo? Why doesn't everything use NFC to connect to everything else?"" 

One of my favorite features was the ability to easily Bluetooth pair things. No more ""what's the device name?"" ""Why isn't it showing up yet?"" ""What's the connection pin?"" Just.. *touch* and you're done

Then I realized because if manufactures started pushing NFC, only android users would be able to take advantage of it. Even tho iPhones have NFC chips, they have them restricted to payments only. It's really frusterating to me, our phones already have the chips, it already only costs cents to make the tags, yet the technology goes mostly unused

EDIT: I know iPhones can pay with NFC. That's not the point. I'm saying they should be able to do more then just payments.",technology

cats,My cat has severe separation anxiety. I combat this by taking him EVERYWHERE with me. Am I doing the right thing?,"Hi everyone!
I got Mushroom as a small kitten around June
2022. He was very confident and seemed to take a liking to me. I was dealing with some quite severe health issues at the time so I was quite homebound save for trips to the shop.

After about a month, I was going out more.
When Id leave the house, he would meow (well, wail) through the house, after a bit of time hide under my bed. He refused to eat, hissed at my mum and sister, and generally seemed worried and scared.

When I got back, he would be back to his cuddly self. He didn't/doesn't like my mum and sister much, but he sits/sat near them and plays/played with them.
After two more times of this happening and Mushroom shitting on the stairs due to nerves, my mum took the operative decision to insist I took the cat out with me. So, I did. He loves it.

He gets nervous sometimes, but never runs, never hisses, and mostly just sits on my shoulder when we're moving and parks himself near me when we're sat on the train/ indoors at a coffee stop or friends house. He rarely shows signs of being scared, purrs on buses and plays like a kitten on the sodding London Tube.

Unfortunately, during a shopping trip in Ikea, a lady came up to me and told me Mushroom was in obvious distress and I was a terrible owner.
This was quite upsetting to hear, but from my observations incorrect - his eyes were slit like and tiny, he was slow blinking at me and my friend, and tucked his paws under him on my lap when we sat down and groomed himself while on my shoulder.

So, Id just like some input from you guys. He goes quite literally everywhere that allows him - even most shops, due to my autism it's a very cheeky excuse as to why I've a cat with me;)
I work freelance so he can come with me on job sites (networking stuff, nothing loud or scary for him or me)

Is this the right way to help my little boy with his separation anxiety?

Thanks for any thoughts x",animals

keto,1 Year on Keto: Over 500lbs Down to 229lbs,"39/m 6'3, 229lbs

A bunch of pictures:

[https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/)

So I lost a lot of weight in one year.  Maybe that's an understatement.  I've been going back and forth on whether to post my update or not.  I'm not trying to brag or show off.  I'm posting more for motivation for people who haven't started Keto or are just beginning. If i can do it, so can you.  

  
Quick story:

Life was not great Pre\-Keto.  I was over 500lbs.  I don't know my exact weight because no scale I had could weigh me.  I had problems getting around. I couldn't stand for long periods of time. I constantly was sweating and always hot.  I'm still upset that I let myself get so bad.  When people say i look great I'm more embarrassed for how I looked to begin with.  

It took me ruining a family vacation to Universal Studios to begin the process in my mind that I have to lose weight.  I was looking forward to going to the Harry Potter area for years.  I was so excited when we got there.  However, I could barely get around.  Walking around was nearly impossible.  I would have to strategically plan my steps and look ahead for a bench to rest.  I ended up seeing a fraction of the Harry Potter area and instead went to an restaurant w/ AC just so I wouldn't have to walk around.  One day, I will have to make it up to my wife and son and take them back so we actually enjoy Universal Studios.  I wish I could say I went home and began Keto. It would take me another 8 months before I actually decided to start this 'journey'.  

Like I said, I don't know my exact weight when i started.  It took me about 5 months before I actually got on a scale.  I was frightened to see the number that would be staring back at me.  I can guesstimate it was over 500lbs as the first time I weighed myself I was @ 386.  I have to figure in 5 months I lost over 114lbs.   

My diet regimen: I went right into One meal a day.  For me it was really easy.  I stayed in a calorie range from 800\-1100 a day.  I know that is VERY low and definitely not for everyone.  However,  I never felt like i was starving or famished.  I quickly got into a groove and never looked back.  It helps that I'm stubborn and not a quitter. If I commit to something I'm not going to give up. I never had a cheat day or meal (nor will I).  I know cheat days are not bad but I would feel awful if i ever went off the rails.

I only weighed myself once a month.  I dont want to do live and die w/ the scale.  At Halloween I was 386, when I last weighed myself on June 1 i was 229.  I think the secret for me on Keto was meal planning and cooking in bulk.  I'd smoke a pork shoulder or some chicken on Sunday and have food for the next week or longer.  

These items made Keto easy for me:

\-Cauliflower rice was a god send.  There is so much I have done with it.

\-Shirataki noodle. They are not for everyone but I love them.

\-Butt Rub. It's a great spice and it's very Keto friendly

\-Rao's Pasta sauce.   I love that stuff.  Low in carbs and so tasty.

I started out wearing 7xl and 8xl tshirts.  My shorts and sweats were 4xl.  

Today, i'm wearing an XL shirt and L shorts.  Yes, there is A LOT of hanging skin.

 When I reflect on my weight loss and where I came from, I think of a movie line from Apollo 13.  It's when Tom Hanks is talking to Kathleen Quinlan after their party looking at the Moon and what it took to get there.

""It's not a miracle.  We just decided to go.""   

I just decided to go. ",foods

keto,WE DID IT!!!!!!!! 200 POUNDS GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!," So, I woke up this morning and thought that I might weigh myself and see how things are going.  I did my normal step on the scale three times to make sure that what I was seeing was correct.  This is the highest of the three:

200 POUNDS IN ONE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      
      
I am proud of what I have done over the past 363 days.     
I am happy about what I done over the past 363 days.    
I am...a little ""misty"" about all of this right now.    
        
I promise everyone here I have worked hard for this.  I promise everyone that I have earned this.  I promise everyone that YOU are as responsible for this as I am!  I promise you that YOU made me work harder.  YOU made me want this even more.  I thank each and every one of you for your kind words, for just being nice to me, and even your words of admonishment.  I honestly feel like I can conquer the world.  I know I have a bunch more work to do, but right now, I just feel good.  I feel powerful.  I feel AWESOME!!!!  
   
Before and so far:     https://imgur.com/hEdJ7wK       
   
I will take a few days off--not from keto, but from being so focused.  Maybe a little vacation from the intensity.  Maybe just enjoy this for a few days.  I have many many many more goals.  I now have one year to get to 270 pounds.  One year to lose 123 pounds.  I will make a post about what I will accomplish over the next year some day next week.  But right now, I just want to enjoy my win!!!     
      
Now for the best part of this:  I try my best to show my gratitude to all of you keto friends, and I am afraid I fall short.  NOTHING I say can properly convey to you just how grateful I am to each and every one of you.  And I know I have said this twice already this week, but I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE!      

Thank you so much my friends.

keto,My Watch has ended - 345 lbs down.,"I wanted to make this post for anyone that's looking to start, has started but has fallen off or stalled or for anyone that's in the tail end of their journey to show that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. I'm just an ordinary guy and I was able to hit my goals. Not always with ease but I was able to get through them.

This is a day that until recently I thought I wouldn't never see. I'm officially under 200 lbs.

I started at 545 lbs in January 2016 and today, in June 2019, I'm 199.8. If you would have told me 3 and a half years ago that I would be here, I would have laughed in your face but here I am. I went from a 7XL to wearing this nifty Medium Tall jacket. 

It wasn't always the easiest of things to do but instead of letting any setbacks or obstacles slow down or ruin my progress, I chose to use those as motivation to get through those times. 

I think I can honestly say that I've gained a life. I went from having trouble fitting into an airline seats,to as of recently being able to jump out of one to skydive. Im grateful for all the support along the way and for those that have supported be since the beginning.

After going through all this, I'm a firm believer that there isn't anything that can't be achieved by myself or anyone else as long as you put in some time, dedication and have a little determination (or stubbornness). Whether it's losing weight, finishing school, jumping out of a plane, getting that promotion, finding your dream job, asking that cute girl out, wrestling a bear, or climbing Everest. If you want something, go after it! ""God placed the best things in life on the other side of fear"" 

At 6'3 and 199 lbs, I think I'm finally at my stopping point. Now the challenge of maintaining. But for the mean time, to quote Jon Snow, ""My watch has ended"". #keto #weightloss #lowcarb #atkins #bacon

Under 200 lbs! https://imgur.com/gallery/jXfAOAM",foods
keto,I’m 69 and keto made it possible for me to climb Mt Fuji,"From 265 to 140 pounds. I’m 69. I’m 5’8”. Never in a million years could I have done this two years ago. But now after being keto since May 2018, I dropped 125 pounds and conquered a mountain. 

Don’t let anyone tell you Keto doesn’t work. It does. Don’t let anyone tell you your metabolism is bad and you can’t lose weight anymore. You can. Don’t let anyone tell you you can eat all the bacon. You can’t. CICO still matters. 

125 pounds!

I’m now a size 8 and too skinny. Figuring this maintenance thing out. Want to get back up to 145 lbs.

Never give up on you.

Or, include the recipe at the top, and the rambling, long-ass storytelling till after the recipe. I just want to cook a damn Keto casserole, not hear a story about how your nana lovingly raised hens to lay eggs and raised her own pigs to slaughter for her breakfast after trekking five miles uphill both ways in the snow and this is her vintage recipe passed down generations.

keto,I'm a loser (-325 lbs) ... And couldn't be happier,"Alright keto family, I'm going to keep this one as short as possible. I started out at 545 lbs in January 2016 and as of this morning, I am 220 lbs. That's 325 lbs in a little over 3 yrs and it's all thanks to low carb /atkins /keto. My goal is to lose 10 more lbs and settle at 210 lbs. 

I'm a firm believer that anyone can lose weight, you just need to find something that works for you and stick to it. Sometimes it just takes a little determination and a little stubbornness because I'm just an ordinary guy that wanted to make a change, nothing special.

Commonly asked questions:

• SW: 545 at 25 yrs old, now I'm 220 at 28
• I'm 6'3
• I did atkins for about a year and a half, keto the rest
• I really don't go to the gym. I'll go for like a week, every 6 months but I need to in order to bulk up
• Yes there is loose skins. It's not the prettiest but it's there. Maybe one day I'll get it taken care of but paying and finishing school take priority 
• Yes my health was super shitty, it's much better now. Don't know of any permeate damage, but hopefully not. 

I really hope this post helps encourage someone that is wanting to start, has started and is having issues, or is a vet but had stalled. I can't tell you how many times I've stalled but I kept it going because I refused to give up. *Que stubbornness*. Like I've said, I'm just an ordinary guy.

keto,Keto since 1972,"I'm 73, female, Atkins since the first book came out in 1972. For the past 3 years I've been strict LCHF + IF.
Have no diseases, take no prescription drugs and have been walking 3 miles before dawn every morning for 4 years. Do yoga and swim laps. I have basically the same body shape as in '72 when I was 28 years old. 

Not only the body benefits from Keto and Intermittent Fasting, but the BRAIN health as well. I encourage you to take care of yourself, even while the people around you are busily scolding you and telling you your WOE will kill you. I'm still alive and running around all healthy while others my age are riding scooters in the super market.

We are the next wave of good health. Read the works of Drs. Dale Bredesen, Jason Fung, and others who are doing all they can to overcome the obesity/diabesity epidemic.

keto,Rant about the standard American diet and my family,"So I'm fat.  So are mom, dad, brothers, sister, cousins and grandparents.  And then there is the diabetes.  Diagnosed, grandma, dad, mom, 3 uncles, and both brothers.  Dead from diabetes, grandma and oldest brother. Incapacitated from stroke dad and uncle. 

Ok so knowing this history you'd think we would as a group change the way we eat.  Research, read, study, try something so we all don't die.  But no it's just pills and doctor visits and death.  

About a year ago I started eating Keto.  I've been to the doctor.  I've lowered my  blood pressure, cholesterol, and my a1c is a 5.  I feel better mentally than I have my entire life.  The constant pain and depression is gone.  I only lost 35 pounds.  I'm still fat, but I feel so damn healthy.  I sleep better, when I'm awake I'm actually awake.  I get stuff done.  Being alive feels good. 

So to continue with my family story, I went to a wedding shower for my niece.  They had a ""pasta bar"" and a ""dessert bar""  Holy shit, it was carbs as far as they eye could see.  Being the rude bitch I am (according to people who think it's rude not to accept the hospitality) I didn't eat anything.  I drank black coffee and watched my mother eat. And eat she did, penne Alfredo, lasagna, breadsticks, and cake.  20 min later she was in my car literally crying.  Sweaty, cold, red, nauseous, dizzy.  I probably should have taken her to the hospital.  She was crying ""my body has betrayed me!""  It was horrible.  And I was angry.  Why does she do this to herself? Why do my family think this is ok? She texted me a day later and said ""for some reason my blood sugar spiked""  Really mom?? For some reason?

She's 28 years older than me.  I'm going to eat low carb for the next 30 years and enjoy the next 30  years of my life.  I fucking refuse to do that to myself.  I am NOT going to die like that.  I'm going to change my family.  My son is not going to be fat and diabetic.  Hes not going to have to watch me suffer in 30 years.  I am going to break this cycle.  Watch me.",foods

Made the call from a hospital bed in Sept 2017 to change. Prior to that had the mindset that life worked around me.At that time I wasn't sure if I HAD time, I was slated to go to a care center to learn how to walk again after a severe back issue. Avoided that, and left on a walker with an oxygen machine,A year of diet later, I had slimmed down a chunk and got a spinal stimulator implanted which helped with pain - was able to get into the gym in January of this year - it's become a daily.

After a body scan a couple weeks ago, I realized that I hit goal. Loss of 215 lbs, and a body fat of 13%.  Intermittant fasting, Keto, and being stubborn absolutely saved my life.

keto,-300 lbs milestone 545 to 245,"I think this is going to be the most honest thing I've ever shared on here but at this point, I'm proud to. It's a day I had hoped for but never thought I would ever see. On the left, we see me before caring about my health and in the middle and right, we see a picture of me from today (with terrible bed hair).That my friends is a 300 lb difference. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom in order to really make a change. My rock bottom was me going to the doctor because my heart was palpitating and the doctor telling me I was pre-diabetic and that he was putting me on pills. At 25, I fucking refused  let this be my life. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that this time, I was going to lose weight. Luckily I found Atkins /low carb and later keto and here we are. I went from a 7XL shirt to now being able to pull off an LT. Thanks to a little dedication (stubbornness more than anything else), 300 lbs is gone that will never come back. I refuse to ever go back to how I was. It hasn't always been easy. Even though the diet itself is straight forward there's times where I've over thought ever single I've eaten because I was afraid in the back of mind that it would cause me to go back to the me on the left (scared to have that piece of pizza, or bite of cake, etc) . I've gotten alot better but it still sometimes lingers in the back of my mind. But I ultimately know that if I ever do have a set back, I won't let it undo everything I've worked hard to do these last few years. My best piece of advice for anyone that does want to lose weight is just to start somewhere. Go for walks, count carbs or calaries, go to the gym, find a diet that works for you. I feel like diet plays the biggest part of losing weight. Not popping some bullshit pill or drinking some bullshit shake, it has to come from you. I'm still not quite at my final goal, I'd like to lose 25 lbs more but I can honestly say, I'm so glad I hit this milestone. I'm grateful that according to my most recent labs, I'm in good health all around. And more importantly, for my family and friends that have been there since the beginning and never encouraging me to continue. #lowcarb #keto #atkins #diet #bacon

When I first started Keto, I used to think about writing a post when I hit my goal weight all the time. Now that I'm doing it, it's completely surreal! I started Keto on 3/29/17 at 180 pounds (short girl here - 5'3""). It was the heaviest I'd ever been. As of 1/15/18, I surpassed my 125 goal and hit 123.8! 

&nbsp;

I am like most of you. I've spent the last 15 years + (my entire adult life!) trying to lose weight. I had tried every diet in the book from shakes, to juicing, to low calorie, to vegetarian bordering on vegan/raw. I tried spinning, running, weight lifting, HIIT, workout videos, everything! No matter what diet or exercise routine I tried, I just could not find anything that stuck. I was a major emotional eater, which led to binge eating. Food was pretty much my solution for everything. People would tell me that I just needed to eat in moderation and that if I deprived myself, I would never be able to sustain it. But I literally craved binging more than the actual foods I was eating, so I didn't know how to not binge and not feel deprived. On my last attempt at losing weight before Keto, I was in a weight loss competition at my gym. I counted calories and worked out like crazy, but it seemed like my body would just not lose weight. I finally started alternating between juice fasts and egg fasts in order to lose the weight and win the contest, but obviously that was not anything sustainable and I gained it all back (plus some) as soon as the contest was over. I felt completely hopeless and I thought that all of the years of dieting had finally screwed up my metabolism like everyone said it would, and now I would no longer be able to lose weight. On top of that, my mind was completely burned out on the constant dieting and I just had no willpower or determination left. I was to the point of pretty much just resigning to be overweight. 

&nbsp;

I don't know what made me start Keto on 3/29/17. It's the first time I ever just started a diet out of the blue. Normally I would have waited till Monday and binged on anything and everything the weekend before. 3/29 was a Wednesday and I had already eaten a high sugar breakfast that morning. It was completely out of character for me to start a diet in the middle of the day, but for some reason, I just decided to make a healthier choice and eat a salad rather than go get fast food for lunch like I normally would have. From there, I just made another healthy choice for dinner. Then the next day I started tracking in MFP and watching my calories and carbs. After that, I used the Keto Calculator to calculate my macros and I was all in. Keto has been life-changing for me. I still love food and I enjoy everything I eat on Keto, but I don't need it the way I used to. It doesn't run my life anymore. I am so proud to say that I have not binged once since I started! 

&nbsp;

Just like everyone else, I had stalls, weeks where I didn't lose, weeks where I could tell my body was holding on to water, etc. While that can be tough, I just stayed consistent and kept going. I tracked everything religiously and didn't cheat (aside from a planned splurge on Christmas day - 9 months into my journey). I am definitely Keto for life! It makes me feel great and I still get to enjoy food without sacrificing how I look and feel. I am still debating whether I want to lower my goal weight a few more pounds, but I'm going to eat at maintenance for a bit and shift my focus to building muscle. I've been lifting since October, so I am going to continue that and see if toning my muscles will get me where I want to be. If not, I may go back to a deficit and lose a little more. 

&nbsp;

I wish I had tried Keto so much earlier. I wasted all of those years on bad diets that made me feel terrible. Almost as soon as I started Keto, it just felt like this is what I was supposed to be doing all along. If you're on the fence about starting, just do it!

keto,UPDATE : I made a basic visual representation of foods that are part of the Keto diet.,"[https://i.imgur.com/FcPXHAv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FcPXHAv.jpg)

Hello! I updated the flawed previous image!Sadly, as i am not a graphic designer in any shape or form, i could not foresee the many problems i encountered. This lead to the final image being a bit hard to read, but oh well. I sank 15 hours into it, and redoing everything would take the same amount so, this is it for now.

I like to believe that i took the advice from the previous thread and fixed the problems that it had. It became a more informational and more correct image, but then again i am repeating myself, it became hard on the eyes and a bit complex. Also, with the introduction of categories, the text became harder to read (yet still readable on modern displays). During the making of this, i noticed that the site i used for the nutritional information probably isn't the best choice, but i hope and believe that it is close enough for it to not matter.

Anyways, its resolution is 12,000 x 7,000 so zooming shouldn't be a problem. I will provide a link to the full image (40mb) in the comments as posts get tagged as ""spam"" if they have more than 1 link in them.

I hope that you like it and find it useful despite its flaws!

Edit : :OOOOOO I forgot to rearrange the chinese cabbage. Since there are like 3 different types, i summed them up between raw and cooked and i got a new value. Then i forgot to move it and now the carbs go from 2,1 -> 1 -> 2,7 . Ooft.

Edit 2 : The grams of carbs are \*net carbs\*.Edit 3 : I should've added a flame symbol next to the meat category + possibly consider making a version with grams of protein/fat instead of %.Also, obligatory thank you for the silver and gold. Not really sure what they do but hey! Thanks again!

Edit 4 : This is not an ""eat only these"" guide. Its purpose is to cover the basics. I might have missed a thing or two but i will never be able to fit every food in it. You can always check the nutritional values of items you like but are not in this image.

Also, the values are not per serving size, they are per 100 grams across all items. Yes, for example, you arent supposed to eat 100g of nuts, but you can always calculate from the numbers i have provided. 100 grams are 0.220lbs.

Edit 5: Thank you to all for the kind words! I try and respond to the more interactive comments but upvoting really isnt enogh for the people who are thankful. Thanks to you for taking the time to check this out and write me a comment! Cheers!  


Edit 6 : The eggs' values for protein and fats % are reversed. There is a possibility that there are 1-2 more items that have the same issue. It is not a gigantic problem, but i will fix them and post an updated picture with other small tweaks needed to be done. Sorry for the inconvenience!",foods

keto,PSA From a Starbucks barista,"Frappuccinos CANNOT be made keto. If you swap whole milk for heavy cream and sweetener for sugar free vanilla, all you've done is consume half a cup of heavy cream and ~40g+ carbs from our emulsifying frappuccinos base, which is a thick sugary syrup. (Yesterday I clocked in and someone managed to gulp down a large frappuccino like this and tell the person at register she was on a LCHF diet and it was delicious and wanted a second. I was busy taking orders in the drive thru and couldn't help the poor woman.) ALSO please do not try to drink a grande heavy cream latte. Even a tall, has 10 oz of milk (2 oz espresso and the rest milk for 12 oz). If you would like an espresso drink, order a hot or iced americano with heavy cream, which would be espresso + water + milk, and you can add any of the sugar free syrups if you like. 

If you are unsure if we put heavy cream in your coffee (you can usually tell because heavy cream can leave small undisolved particles in your drink which go away when stirred, or if the color seems too dark) then ask us. We understand dietary restrictions and want to make sure you get what you are paying for!

Our ice coffee and ice tea come sweetened, as instructed by our recipes. Our cold brew ice coffee does not, but ask for all of these unsweetened anyways, then substitute whatever you like, out of sugar free vanilla or sugar free cinnamon dolce (mixing them together is heaven for me). Our skinny mocha sauce contains few carbs depending on the size, if it fits in your macros it can help curb a mean chocolate craving. Our hot coffee and hot tea do not come pre-sweetened and you have the same syrup options as above, or your own. These are the safest options for getting what you want, esp. a nice dark roast pour over... 🤤 anyways.. We use Kerry gold butter squares you can ask for on the side if you like as well. 

Lastly, if you have any questions AT ALL, do not be afraid to ask your register person or a barista that doesn't look too busy. We also have a designated person that can help customer needs, they can usually be found wearing a timer attached to their apron, restocking and cleaning things, if your register person is busy. Whether it's for how to order a drink, or what have you, don't be afraid! It took me at least a month to be able to remember even most of the menu, it can be daunting.  The only thing we wouldn't know, is the nutrition info for your drink, because most of these require some math. 

I know for most people Starbucks is unnessecary, but for those who regularly get their energy fix here, I thought this would help as these are some of the things I notice LCHF customers seem to have confusion with. I'm open to any questions you guys might have! KCKO!

Edit for clarification: The recipes for our ice teas and ice coffees, by default, say to add pumps of sweetener. However, they are brewed with plain tea leaves/plain coffee grinds. :)

Edit 2: it's also worth noting our egg bites have 9g carbs for bacon ones and 11g carbs for egg white ones, they have added rice starch sadly. On frappucinnos; you can ask to get your drink blended without base emulsifier, but the flavor and texture will be no where near the same and some stores will say no. On drink recommendations; everyone's taste is different so I recommend googling some Starbucks keto recipes and trying what you think might be good :)

Edit 3, the edit to end all edits: if you guys are unsure if you're drink is ok, the safest thing you can do is log it, and that goes for any food or drink you might have going past your lips. Nutrition info for half and half, 2%, most almond milks, etc. are all online, again I don't know for your specific drink, so it's safer to look it up! Second, *frappuccinos are not keto.* you can attempt at a keto ""frappuccino"" but by standards it's not a frappuccino, the baristas *can and might* say no, the consistency is not the same, and they might put in the emulsifier base anyways. Third, I'm not gonna tell you not to drink a whole cup of heavy whipping cream, I'm just warning everyone that it's not smart to drink 6, 10, 14, or 18 oz. of heavy whipping cream in one go (short, tall, grande, and Venti respectively). If you can't live without your grande heavy cream flat white then don't. Lastly, thanks for the gold!! 💕",foods
keto,I. Just. Lost. It. At. Kohls.,"I went to buy Christmas gifts for my 2 girlfriends. As I was getting ready to go to the register,  my dear husband says, ""You'd look great in that top."" I rolled my eyes because I haven't bought anything off the rack in a store in over 15 years. I have been wearing 5X-6X and buying online. So I quietly said to him that even though the Keto lifestyle has been working on us for the past 7 months, I doubted that anything there would fit me, especially a pretty fancy fitted party top. He picked up the biggest size on the rack... a very small looking 2X and handed it to me.
I reluctantly tried it on... O.M.G. Yup... I fit into a 2X & it looked good!!!
Now, my butt still demands a 3-4X... but it's progress!
I showed him.
He smiled and gave a thumbs up. 
I broke down in tears in the aisle.
Over 15 years......... and he bought & picked my 1st new wardrobe item off the rack.
I'm 90# down in 18 months but 73 of them are Keto in 7 months. I've skulked around here for months.
Yall make me laugh.
And hope.
And believe in myself after decades of failures.  I've learned that my PCOS and cancer background, etc hindered my success.
Oh and today my hubby saw his Dr.
His numbers were all in normal range. His A1C for T2D showed 6.8 -- under the Dr. Target of 7.
He was taken off Lantus/insulin. In a few months the doc is considering removing the metformin too.

keto,50 years ago The sugar industry paid off scientist to point blame on fat. (Article in text),"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=food

In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to ""refute"" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.

The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.

The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.

""It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,"" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.

keto,During my recent doctor's visit he sighed at me...,"Got a routine check up and blood test this week. Last time I was in the office was early January and I weighed in at 290 pounds and my blood pressure was 156/100. The doctor told me to check back mid-year and if my blood pressure was still high I was definitely going on meds. I agreed with him on that, even with White Coat Syndrome that blood pressure was way too high. So I promised I would be in better shape the next time I came in. He just nodded while writing in my chart and said ""uh huh..."" Granted, I'm sure he has heard that a million times with no real outcome. But I was dead set on changing my ways.

Cut to this week's appointment. I step on the scale and it was 243 pounds. The nurse then took my blood pressure and it was 145/100 (shit). She took it a second time, but this time she had me talk about my kids. I told her some funny stories and when she finished she said ""see, much better"". The second measurement was 128/85, higher than it should be, but not terrible. The doctor came in, asked me how everything was, did a quick examination, then sat down looking at my chart and sighed. He turns to me and says ""With that blood pressure you have two options: I can put you on blood pressure meds or you can lose weight and exercise"". I had a slight smile under my facemask and asked, ""you mean like the fifty pounds I've lost since I saw you last?"" He furrowed high brow at me, then scrambled through my charts while saying ""YOU DIDN'T LOSE FIFTY POUNDS!!"". Then his eyes lit up and he said ""You son of a bitch. Wow. Good job! Let's keep you off the meds for now and see where you are in 6 months. I'm impressed."" He didn't ask how I did it, but said to keep on doing what's working and we'll meet again in 6 months.

keto,Simple Starbucks Keto Guide - From A Barista,"As a Starbucks barista doing Keto, I've had to improvise a bunch during my time here! Here are some of the tips I've picked up along the way.

**Drinks**

Here are some of the drinks that I order

* Iced Tea w/ an Infusion and no Liquid Cane Sugar.
   * This is my go\-to order! In terms of teas, we have Black, Green, White, and Passion tea \(an herbal tea\).
   * We also have our infusions! In these guides, I always see the Iced tea mentioned but never the infusions. The infusions are really just herbal teas and they can completely change the flavor of your drink! We have Pineapple, Peach, and Strawberry \(some locations may vary\). You can combine and of them with the teas and it will likely turn out amazing! \(I personally haven't tried any of them with the passion tea\)
   * When ordering, just ask for your tea with the infusion and unsweetened. For Example, ""Venti Iced Green Tea with the Pineapple Infusion and unsweetened""
* Hot Teas and Coffee
   * Our hot teas and drip coffee come unsweetened by default. You can get whatever you want. You can also ask them to steam a little bit of heavy cream on top. Make sure to specify a little bit, otherwise they might make it a ""misto"" Which is half coffee/tea and half heavy cream.
* Iced Coffee/Cold Brew
   * There is a lot you can do with iced coffee and cold brew. Our Iced coffee get classic syrup by default, so be sure to specify that you want it ""unsweetened.""
   * We currently have two sugar free syrups, Cinnamon Dolce and Vanilla. I personally recommend the vanilla \(not a big fan of the cinnamon dolce\). We also have a ""skinny"" mocha. The skinny mocha is sugar free, but it is sweetened with sucralose, which can affect blood sugar levels, so it’s best to consume this in moderation. By the way, it can successfully kill a chocolate/mocha craving. :\)
   * If your are getting a sugar free syrup/skinny mocha, make sure to specify the number of pumps you want depending on the size. I recommend 2 for a tall, 3 for a grande, and 4 for a venti of sugar free syrups and 1 of skinny mocha in a tall/grande and 2 in a venti.
   * You can also ask for light Heavy Cream or light Almond Milk on top.
* Keto ""Pink Drink""
   * Now, let me start this by saying this taste absolutely NOTHING like our normal pink drink, so don't expect it to. Although it is a close color and tastes very intriguing. In order to order it, ask for this:
   * \[Tall,Grande,Venti\] Iced Passion Tea with No Liquid Cane Sugar, \[2,3,4\] pumps of sugar free vanilla and light heavy cream on top.
   * If you want it to look more like the Pink Drink, You can ask them to add the Freeze Dried strawberries to it.
* Keto Carmel Macchiato.
   * This drink will likely be higher in carbs than the previous options, coming in around 5\-6 grams of carbs. Also, I wouldn't recommend anything bigger than a grande. A grande would probably have 6\-8 grams of carbs in it, a tall would be around 3\-6. Also, the hot version will have more carbs than the iced version because there is more milk. Ask for it like this:
   * \[Tall,Grande\] Skinny Caramel Machiato with almond milk and no caramel drizzle.
   * if it fits your macros, you can ask for light caramel drizzle, which will add about 2\-3 carbs to your drink.
   * Our almond milk has 5 grams of carbs per cup. A tall iced will likely have about 5oz of almond milk while the hot will have around 10oz.
   * You can ask for heavy whipping cream \(around 7g of carbs per cup\) but it will also have over 800 calories for a cup. Additionally, you can go half heavy cream half almond milk if you'd like.
* Keto Mocha
   * This is a great option for those occasional Chocolate cravings. Half and Half steams a lot better than heavy cream, so if you can spare the carbs, go with ""breve"" over heavy cream \(it will also have significantly less carbs.
   * How I order it: Short mocha with three pumps of skinny mocha. Breve
   * You can adjust the pumps of mocha to your taste.
* Keto Doubleshot.
   * One of my go\-to drinks that I still enjoy every time. I love this drink. A venti doubleshot will have five shots of espresso shaken with ice in a shaker then topped off with 2&#37; milk. Simply substitute the 2&#37; with light heavy cream or almond milk! I like to flavor mine with sf vanilla, but play around with the recipe to find what you like!
   * How I order: Venti Starbucks Doubleshot on Ice Unsweetened with almond milk and sugar free vanilla.
* Keto Chai
   * This one I get only occasionally because im not positive of the amount of carbs in it, but it should be relatively low. Its just like our chai tea latte with little compromise \(not watery like the chai tea back\) I also usually get more pumps of the chai because I like the spice. here's how I order:
   * ""Grande Iced Lightly Sweet Chai Latte, NO liquid cane, 3 Splenda \(or sweetener of your choice\), breve.""
   * The sweetener is optional, bUt I think it adds a lot to the taste.

**Things to Eat:**

If you ever have to eat at Starbucks, im sorry! We don't have that many options. Here are some of my go\-tos though

* The inside of a panini! I usually get either the turkey pesto panni or the chicken and double smoked bacon and eat the insides of it. The turkey pesto is relatively filling if you combine it with a drink from above.
* Most Starbucks will have almonds, some sort of cheese, or a cheese and salami tray.
* The Egg and cheese protein box. leaving the fruit.
* The new meal sized BLT Turkey protein box. I leave the bread off.
* On occasion ill get the Bacon sous vide egg bites, but very rarely. I usually rub a pat of butter on them and eat them. Beware that they do have 9g of carbs for both \(11g from the egg white bites\)
* Edit: **Moon Cheese!:** These crunchy little cheese balls are amazing and are 100&#37; cheese! I eat these every time my store gets it in but we always sell out! It truly is a godsend when you miss that ""crunchy"" texture! Also great in salad and other foods

**General Tips:**

* If you think your Iced Tea is too watery, ask for no water! We usually put 50&#37; tea and 50&#37; water and then add ice! I personally never get water in my teas.
* If you want Splenda or another sweetener in your tea, ask the barista to shake it into the tea, it will usually taste better because it will be more dissolved/incorporated in.
* On that note, always make sure your tea is shaken! All us barista SHOULD shake the teas but sometimes we forget \(and some baristas don't at all\) but it definitely WILL make it better! Especially with the infusions.

**Things To Note:**

* Our Almond Milk only has 5g of carbs per 8 ounces, making it one of the lowest carb milk options we have.
   * Coconut milk has 8g per 8 ounces
   * Soy has 13g per 8 ounces
* Our Teas and Iced Coffee's come with syrup in the recipe, but we can remove it upon request!
* We have two sugar free syrups currently available: Vanilla and Cinnamon Dolce
* If you're feeling fancy, we can make you a pour\-over, which is where we brew a coffee fresh for you using the ""pour\-over"" method. You can choose any of our coffees \(some stores have more variety than others\)
* Our whipped cream is Heavy Cream and regular vanilla syrup, so it does have a good amount of carbs. However, it is fresh and delicious, so you can ask for just a little bit on top of your drink if it fits your macros.
* Your barista is willing to help you! Just be nice and let them know you cannot eat sugar and ask them for a suggestion!

**Things To Avoid:**

* Frappuccinos. It doesn't matter if you get it ""light"". The light base has 50&#37; less sugar than the regular one, but it still have enough sugar to knock you out of ketosis. While you can ask for any drink blended, They won't stick together and the liquid will separate from the blended ice.
* Refreshers: Bottom line, our refreshers have a lot sugar. making them not suitable for Keto.
* Stevia: Our stevia is mixed with fructose and has 2g of carbs per packet.
* Breakfast Sandwich ""Insides"": The eggs inside the breakfast sandwiches all have carbs due to the mixture used. This includes the wraps.
* Any regular syrup: This one is kind of self\-explanatory, But you'd be surprised how many people say they are low carb and ask for ""only three pumps"". On average, each pump of our regular syrups have 4\-6g of carbs.
* White Mocha: There is no skinny version of this.
* Matcha: Our matcha is a mix that comes pre\-sweetened.
* Chai: Our chai mix has a ton of carbs. Even the lightly sweet chai has carbs. However, our chai tea bags have no carbs.

Be sure to drop any questions in the comments! I'll try to answer them all! I hope your guys found this helpful. Ill try to update this as I remember more details. Additionally, please feel free to comment what you get at Starbucks, I can add it to this guide to help other users!

keto,I am dying,"According to the nurse.  Who sat across from me at two dinners last weekend.  Most people who were at the dinners hadn’t seen me in years and didn’t know I lost 110lb from 2018 to 2019.  So they were a little shocked.  She asked how because she and her husband have been unsuccessful.

She immediately told me I was going to die from liver failure.  I couldn’t help but let out an immediate laugh and then catch myself (thanks bourbon).  She told me she sees young people go into liver failure and die from keto all the time her hospital.   

She really didn’t like when I told her my doctor has been taking advanced labs every time I see him and is scratching his head.  All measurements have improved.  Everything related to heart, liver and kidneys.  She said the lab must be wrong.  I just smiled and said “The proof is not in the pudding. Pudding is what the labs say was killing me.”

So, the Reddit keto saying proves true again.  No one worries if you eat cake for every meal,  but eat clean and people freak out.",foods

Even though 99% of the replies have been super positive and supportive I thought I'd come address the ones that think this is fake or demanding a body shot. Look I never claimed that we are super skinny models now because we 100% aren't I'm still not happy with my body and I've got some more to lose, probably 10-15 kgs more I'm still reasonably big but no where near what I used to be. My gf still wants to lose weight as well so our journey continues. Yes the after picture is a great angle and it capturing all the right things, literally every single person that takes a picture of themselves does this, its still us... that's still what we look like... its not fake.

keto,A plea to all the seasoned Keto-ers on this sub to be kind to the noobs.,"I started Keto over a year ago when I was diagnosed as ""pre-diabetic"", insulin resistant, and had other health problems.  EVERYONE in my life was against me doing keto, always telling me that it was a crazy fad diet and unhealthy, etc.  I had ZERO support in my life and relied on this sub as my support system.  It takes a while to synthesize all the information, and I found mostly great support on here.  All it took, however, was the occasional meany (telling me I was an idiot or making snarky comments) to get me down.  Many of us on here are trying to make a healthy change to save our lives and don't know all the information right out of the gate.  Please be kind to the noobs who are here looking for information and have questions.  If you have some information to share with a poster, just be kind (or at least just matter of fact) or just don't comment at all.  I've just introduced a friend to Keto and this sub, and going through it today I saw a few really snarky comments to noobs, and remembered what that was like when I was a noob.

keto,Finnally got on a scale... It wasn't at all what I expected.,"So, my life was kind of at a rock bottom. I had a spouse who regularly threatened me, controlled me, and manipulated me. So, I ate. 

Now, I'd always been a big guy all my adult life (over 300 lbs), but when I was eating to cope, I ate so much, that one day when I stepped on a scale, I realized I had ballooned up to almost 350 lbs. 

I had done Keto once before, very successfully, so I wanted to start again. The last time I only stopped because my spouse demanded it. 

Well, this time I stopped listening. Not just about the food. I took my life back, filed for divorce, and ate what I chose to eat. 

I didn't even buy a scale. After moving out, I had very little. I slept on a folded up blanket on the floor for the first month. I had to make sure my child had everything he needed, first. A scale just wasn't a priority. I was eating Keto because it made me feel better. The number didn't matter. 

I don't track my carbs or my calories. I just stick to low carb foods and I eat when I'm hungry. That's it. 

So, in an effort to get some sort of furniture together, I went down to the Salvation Army store. And on the shelf there, there was a bathroom scale. 

I thought, ""I've never been under 300 lbs, in my adult life. It would be awesome if I was down to 299 by now."" 

So I got on the scale, just to see, with clothes and shoes and everything. 

I was convinced it was broken. I ended up having to ask someone else to stand on it (someone who knew what they weighed) to make sure it worked. 

I'm 279 lbs. I don't even know how to process that. 

I'm getting my life back, slowly, and it is hard to think about all the time I wasted not doing the things I needed to for myself. But this is one I will stick to.

Edit: Omg, gold? Thank you. The outpouring of support from this community has been heart-warming. Thank you all. I'm replying to everyone I can. It might take a while but I'll get to you all!",foods
keto,250lbs lost with keto. One week post skin surgery.,"Hey keto friends! I wanted to share over here what I shared in another similar diet subreddit, because it was just as much your community and support system here that got me to where I am today!

**TLDR: Picture album at the bottom.**

Things start pretty fast if you are scheduled for a morning run. You get to the hospital and into the surgical pre-op staging room. Here you get to meet all the wonderful people like your nurses, assistant anesthesiologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon and more. Each of which you will end up forgetting. They ended up putting the IV in my foot, which I hear is rare, as they would be flipping me around like a short order cook making pancakes through the procedure. One of the final things that happened is my surgeon came along with his purple crayons and did some impressionistic art on me. Anyways, shortly after this I was wheeled away and honestly taken to what I assume was the surgical theater, after this photo was taken, I don't remember a thing that happened to me.

It's one of the most jarring things I can think of in life, coming out of a fog where you just feel lost and cheated of your time on earth. Before you open your eyes you can think of nothing but a void, no dreams or thoughts happened. To me, I just ceased to exist at this time. I was pretty out of it, but I remember my mom telling me that things didn't exactly go as planned. The surgeon said he wanted to do a perfect job, and to do so required him making the planned surgery go from 3.5 hours to 7. And in this time he took away 10lbs of skin, repaired my abdominal muscle wall (OWE), relocated my nipples, and gave me a brand new belly button. I later found out that scheduling was pretty upset at him because there was another procedure lined up after me. He ended up buying the nurses for me and the patient after a bunch of pizza to make up for the long hours!

Due to the time I had been out and under anesthesia, and the amount of work he did on me and took away from me, the doctor ordered that I remain overnight. Normally it's a same day surgery, unfortunately not for me. He was worried I'd have some severe pain as well as a lot of recovering to do from the trauma I incurred (thankfully, I only lost 1/2 unit of blood. How do they measure that by the way?). Next thing I remember from my brief moment of existence in the surgical recovery room was waking up in the main hospital. It was here I spent the next 20 or so hours where I thankfully had some of the best nurses looking after me. Here actually my main pain was from the gas that was building up inside my gut, and my inability of being able to use my abdominal muscles. I didn't care about the pain, they just plain would not respond to me! Also, after countless IV's and cups of water with out output on my end, they gave me an ultimatum. Pee in this hand held urinal sometime soon, or we are going to have to catheterize you. That got my body working it's #1 pipes again at least.

As nice as it is to be waited on and taken care of by professionals, I wanted out of that place. I despise IV's and the burning they leave in your hand, and the thought of the infection found there just gives me nightmares. Though, they did prepare a pretty solid clam chowder. While my blood pressure kept dropping on each vitals readings, it finally stabilized as long as I kept my compression binder on (within those first 24 hours I would very nearly pass out, get clammy, go def/blind if it got taken off). Walking a bit with the nurses and getting a brief checkup from the surgeon though I was finally discharged! The ride home was full of cursing each bump and pothole my wonderful city takes pains to maintain. But I made it, and into what ended up being the most wonderful recovery bed/recliner that I lived in for about three days.

Since then I've thankfully progressed enough to consider myself more or less independent and moved bad at my own apartment, just needing assistance here and there from my roommate. I'm surprised by the pain to be honest, if I'm not up and about I'm really quite comfortable if not for the er, well severe (medically worrying constipation), I'd be quite content. I thank my surgeon so much for his expertise and the techniques he says he uses to minimize the pain the patient feels after the ordeal. On my first week appointment with him my JP drains on three of my sites had discharge low enough for a removal, and I was ordered to get milk of magnesia and if that does not work, magnesium citrate for the constipation, they seemed worried about that (Thankfully MoM got stuff flowing again). I wanted to try out ibphrophin, and that actually seems to be doing the job instead of my hydro's and tramadol. After just one week of recovery, I feel like I might actually be able to make it through a day at my desk IT job!

I still feel like I am pulling my skin tight when I stand up straight, like I am wearing a bodysuit a size too small for me. But it'll stretch in time. Pain is there yes, but it's something I'm fighting through. And my compression binder is helping out. From what I understand, the scars themselves will be ugly and weak for up to six weeks, and the swelling and final body shape might take up to four-six moths to come together. But it made me cry. Finally, I am seeing a body of a person who I feel like was on the inside, and not some costume on the outside. There is a long way to go, and this does not mean I'm done, this journey is life long. But for now, it's a bit check in the win column.

I'd love to answer questions people might have about this whole process! It's a side of the story that not all choose to take, but those that do don't seem to see much support for.

keto,Lost 260 pounds on the Keto diet in a little over 2 years.,"I've been a longtime lurker here and when I initially started keto around 3 years ago, it really helped me out. Seeing all your success stories and advice helped me push through. I wanted to thank everyone with this post and maybe help anyone who's having doubts or feeling down with my own story.

&#x200B;

3 years ago I was 500 pounds at my absolute worst. Went through a traumatic experience when I was 17 and afterwards the weight just seemed to add on over the years. I'd always been a big guy but it got really bad. Decided to start the keto diet after looking into healthier lifestyles and fast forward two years later (with intermittent fasting and gym training) I had lost 260 pounds. I kept under 1200 calories a day and the best feeling was not constantly being hungry. The last year has been more of a maintenance but with keto cycling.

&#x200B;

I'm at 240 now and actually weigh less than I did in high school. Have a decent amount of excess skin that skews my actual weight. Thankfully the government of Canada pays for plastic surgery in my case because it could lead to health problems in the future. Surgery is in about 8 or so months and I'm quite excited to start a completely new chapter of my life once it's done.

&#x200B;

I never really planned this out and did the whole progress photo thing but I'll share some photos of me around my worst and some current photos for comparison. 6'3 if it means anything. I actually had photos of me bigger than these but my old phone is finished and cost too much to fix but this is still me NEAR my absolute largest.

TW: Eating Disorder

For years I had lied to myself and thought that going to the gym once a week and Eating a salad that day was making me lose weight. I thought that me gorging on 4 burritos and 2 quesadillas every night and then purging after would stop me from gaining any weight. All lies I told myself to try and provide myself happiness. My first 2 years of college I suffered from an eating disorder and gained an astronomical amount of weight (100+ pounds).

*Flash forward to spring 2020*

20 years old on May 18th of 2020, I weighed 527 pounds, and started keto as a joke. When I saw I had lost 20 pounds in a week and a half, I knew this was my shot and I had to take it.

Keto began, started walking a mile a day and now I’m running 6 miles a day and lifting weights, kicked my eating disorder, and now my life has never been better. I can’t believe I let myself get so disgusting and have sworn to never EVER look back.

Weighed in when I took the update picture at 419 pounds! I weigh less than I did my senior year of high school! It hasn’t been easy, and I’ve only had one cheat day on Christmas Day to celebrate losing 100 pounds. Needless to say after the carb side effects I won’t be doing that again for a LONG time haha.

I still have a long ways to go, and I’m trying to lose about 70 more pounds by August in order to walk on to my college’s football team. To some, this may sound impossible, but I now know that anything’s within reach if you just put your mind to it! If anyone has any questions I’m more than happy to answer them! Just wanted to share my update with you all!

EDIT: Forgot to add it but I also do OMAD fasting, every day at 545 PM!

[Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/rRrp44P)

I started keto in May of 2019. I was over 400 pounds at the time. I had a hard time doing a lot of very basic things. I got out of breath easily, and I was too big to fit in booths, standard chairs, and closed MRI machines. I became prediabetic and had alarmingly high blood pressure. I was afraid that I wasn't going to live long enough to see my four-year-old twins grow up. I felt hopeless and sank into a deep depression.

After some therapy to deal with the depression issues, I decided that I wanted to improve my life, and that meant getting my weight under control. I lurked here for a month or so, reading and re-reading the FAQ, researching keto, and getting inspired by all of the success stories here. So as I hit my first major milestone, I wanted to share my story with you as thanks.

My blood sugar, A1C, and blood pressure are now all back within normal ranges. I look better and feel healthier than I have in years. I can play outside with my kids! I still have a ways to go for my goal weight, but life is already so much better than I ever imagined it could be again.

If you're thinking of giving keto a try, go for it. Your health is worth fighting for. And for everyone in the middle of their journeys, keep strong and I hope you crush your goals in 2020!

Today, June 2nd, makes 9 months since I began Keto, and I weigh 250 lbs.","I've posted on here before about my progress, but I'll retread my history and context. I've grown up big. I've been a fat guy my whole life. I've dealt with it, been depressed about it, and cried about it. I'm a 29 year old man, and I've cried because of being fat. I've tried to lose weight many times in the past, unsuccessfully. I went to the hospital last May, and I wasn't really weighing myself because I knew the grim reality. Mentally, I had accepted I was huge and I'd probably be dead before I reached 60 as my family's genes are known for heart issues. The nurse told me I had **weighed 350 lbs**. *Yikes.* As the summer went on, I realized how lonely I was. I saw someone I looked up to lose some weight and it really inspired me to TRY to lose weight (shouts out to Rocco from Mega64 for that one). I tried to get out more but I just was never happy. And then I started to exercise a little and saw no change. Then WoW Classic came out and I wasn't leaving my room and eating Zebra Cakes all day. I was watching a streamer who began to talk about their experience with weight loss and they truly motivated me to get to work and change my damn life around (shouts out to GreekGodX). 

So on Sept 2nd, 2019, I got rid of the Zebra Cakes. I dumped out the carb-filled drinks. I began anew. I had some bumps in the road to start, and realized I was eating WAY more strict than I had to, counting TOTAL CARBS instead of net carbs. But the ball was rolling. I learned a lot and lost quite a bit in a small amount of time. My coworkers were constantly telling me I had looked great. But I wasn't seeing it myself. I don't know what it is about the human brain, but I can't see it when I look in a mirror. It's like a phantom that haunts me, I can't unsee myself as huge. I was wearing 4XL shirts and now I'm wearing a XL shirt. From size 52 waist jeans to 40 waist jeans. But I can't see it still. I have a jawline now. But unless I see a photo side by side, it's almost like it doesn't matter. It's the worst feeling. But I know I'm succeeding. **I now weigh 250 lbs.** I have been stagnant for about four weeks total now, despite meeting my macros. But, that comes with the territory. I'm still very pleased with my progress. I can RUN again. I go for jogs sometimes now!

On the left, was May 2019 at 350 lbs. On the right, was March 2020 at around 270 lbs. I currently don't have a better one at 250 lbs, but this was one of the first photos where I truly saw change, so I'm sticking with it here. Coronaszn has made it so I haven't really had much interaction with others, so no opportunities to take a photo! 

For anyone thinking about starting keto, do it. I loved pizza more than anything, but fat head dough and chicken crust pizza have been saviors. There are so many delicious things (and I don't even mean just vegetables, despite loving asparagus now) you can have! 250 lbs, or 100 pounds lost, in 12 months was my original goal but here I am 3 months ahead of schedule. Now I'm aiming for 200 lbs by January. I hope to make it! 

I've had two really eye opening, revealing moments that got me emotional: 

1. I take an annual photo at a gaming convention with my friends, and with a group I follow online. These were my first ""comparison"" photos to last year. It wasn't until I saw these photos side by side with last year's photos that I could see a drastic change. I told my friends how incredible it felt to me, but I don't know that it was understood. People may think I'm exaggerating when I say I can't see the difference, but when I saw the photo...I had such joy I cried in the bathroom for a bit. I felt so accomplished finally...

2. I've been wearing 4XL shirts forever. They've gotten really loose on me so I started wearing my 3XL shirts from back in the day...and then I bought a single 2XL shirt and it fit pretty well. That felt nice! And then, there was this T-Shirt I REALLY wanted, but was only available in an XL size. I took a chance, thinking, at least maybe in 6 more months it would fit. It arrived, and damn it, it fit well. It's a little SNUG but it FITS. I haven't worn an XL ANYTHING since I was in 6th grade. This felt AMAZING. But now it's time to start replacing my wardrobe and make my pockets hurt. 

I hope if nothing else, perhaps someone can get some inspiration or motivation from this. Keto will help. And I feel like it's saved my life.",foods

keto,The Way She Looks At Me.,"I have been doing Keto and lifting weights for about two months. I lost about 30 pounds (50 overall) in those two months (SW:270 KSW: 252 CW: 222). It’s all been a really great experience. One experience stands out from the rest though. 

My wife and I were arguing. It was my fault and I was just letting her vent (if you make a mistake you have to take the punishment). She was really passionate about what she was talking about. I was standing there shirtless and in the middle of her talking I crossed my arms across my chest. She immediately got red, a little flustered and kind of just stopped talking.  I asked her what was wrong? She said “you can’t just stand there shirtless with your chest and big arms, I can’t concentrate on being mad at you.”  

I have never felt so good about myself as I did in that moment. My wife thought I was hot to the point of getting flustered. What an amazing feeling.

TLDR: I have been working out and doing Keto. My wife was “yelling” at me, I crossed my arms across my chest and she got flustered, saying I can’t do that because she can’t concentrate on being mad at me.",foods
keto,Tips for Super Fat People (Like ME!) Just Starting Out,"I wanted to write something specifically to those of us who have 100, 200, or even 300 pounds to lose, from somebody who has been there. These are things I would like to have read 75 pounds ago when I started out at 415. If these offend anyone, my bad. Feel free to add your own two cents.

1. **Everything you know about food is wrong.** I'm a reasonably intelligent, educated professional person, but I didn't know shit about food and nutrition. I thought I was eating ""healthy"" this whole time because I would get ""organic"" chips or I would eat sweet potato fries. Unfortunately, there are a lot of corporations out there that benefit from misinformation, and lots of food being touted as healthy that isn't. RESEARCH keto, HFLC, insulin, IF. YouTube, Keto subreddit, books... Google that shit, because most of what you know is wrong, or we wouldn't be this size. You're not stupid, you're mis-informed and you've been fed a lifetime of bullshit by a lot of bullshitters.

2. **You're exhausted. Push past it.** Being super fat is exhausting. You have no energy. It hurts to put on shoes and go to the store, muchless walking around reading labels. START eating right and the energy will come. When I was 415 pounds, literally even walking *killed* my lower back. It was SO much easier to get starchy, carb-filled take-out with a pint of ice cream and check out after work. Because again, you're exhausted. Don't do that. Start eating right and the energy will come, and it will come faster than you expect it to. But seriously, just fucking start. Most people who have lost a shit-ton of weight wish they'd started earlier. The literal earliest point you can start is now. Don't wait for a health scare. Don't wait to get the energy. Don't wait until your first triple bypass to finally get the motivation. The motivation will come when you're eating HFLC and the scale is going down. That shit is super fucking motivating.

3. **You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time.** I'm down 75 pounds, I still have a LONG way to go, and I'm BARELY noticing changes. All my clothes were stretchy (because I was a fucking 5x) so yes, my clothes are baggier than they were, but I'm still wearing my 415-pound clothing. Because it's all leggings and verrrryyy stretchy material. Learn to appreciate the non-""noticeable"" NSVs, like ""my back hurts less"" or ""I can walk longer distances"". Don't get discouraged if nobody notices for a while because, and I hate to say this, skinnier people spend a lot of time trying to not comment on or notice fat peoples' weight. They may feel like they're offending you by pointing it out, or they genuinely can't/don't notice a difference.

A skinny person can lose 30 pounds and it will be DRASTIC. If you're over 300 and you lose 30 pounds, you might not even be able to tell. Keep going. Keep fucking going. 

4. **The biggest battle you'll face is against hunger.** At my heaviest, I *lived* to eat. I'd eat everything I could, and I'd still always be hungry. Because of how our bodies store fat, I've heard it described something like this: ""Obese people are surrounded by layers of fat, but they're nutritionally starving inside."" Really the *only* solution I've *ever* found is keto. Before I did keto 100% I would try and up my fat intake to stay full longer, but if you're eating extra fat and still eating a shit ton of carbs, that's not gonna work. Get rid of the fucking carbs (except for vegetables, veggies are dope).

5. **Your friends will sabotage you.** Look, you're the fat friend. You're the friend your friends call when they want ice cream, pizza, cake, and they don't want to feel guilty about it because you're fatter than they are. It's shitty, but it's happened to me. Misery loves company, and the people around you will doubt/question/criticize or flat-out berate your lifestyle change. Find new friends or get real fucking good at setting good boundaries.

6. **TRACK YOUR MACROS** When I wasn't tracking my macros, I was genuinely confused about how I was so heavy. It seemed to defy physics. I would eat fruits and vegetables, and it didn't *feel* like I should be as heavy as I was until I started tracking my macros. Fuck, I was eating a lot of food. Like, a lot. A pastry with coffee. Coffee with loads of sugar. Free food. Drive-ins. So, so many calories (thousands!!!) came from source I didn't even CONSIDER until I stopped eating shitty food. If you think you can eye-ball your keto journey and ""guess"" about keeping your carbs under 20 g, congrats, you're wrong. 

One of the things I realized was that I was eating way way too much food to counter-balance the constant fatigue I felt, which actually turned out to be crazy blood sugar spikes from, ironically, all that food. It's such a vicious cycle.

7. **Stop eating out** Just stop. Restaurants and fast food joints have zero stake in your health. In fact, they benefit greatly from your dependence on them and your repeat business. Cook your own food. It sucks, it's a learning curve, but you'll save all the money and you'll *actually* see results, instead of eating fast food ""low carb"" and still ingesting 3,000+ calories a day. Keto doesn't really work if you're still eating giant, giant meals that just happen to be the *right* food. Keto is great, but it's not going to replace actual physics. Trust me, I tried living on blocks of cheese every day at first. 

8. **Figure out what works for you, and fuck the rest.** My well-meaning friends are full of advice that seems good in theory, but absolutely doesn't work for me. I've gotten good at saying, ""thanks for the advice!"" and then just doing whatever the fuck I was already doing. My advice now comes from this subreddit, YouTube videos from doctors and nutrition experts, and science-based articles and books that genuinely know how the body works, NOT from my dear, sweet older co-worker who insists that fruit is the key to true weight loss. 

Please feel free to add your own! I'm always looking for more advice from big people who've been there! KCKO!

keto,I did it. I lost 100 pounds in 6 months. Holy sheep. [PICS],"Today is my 6 month keto anniversary ... and I did it. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months.  Yikes!  

I've tried every diet under the sun.  Weight Watchers, Seattle Sutton, Nutrisystem, juicing, Slimfast, Adipex ... and I just got fatter.  I was thisclose in January to getting bariatric surgery - an obesity specialist told me (very nicely btw) that my only hope of losing weight was to have a gastric sleeve or gastric bypass.  I decided to give losing weight one last go, fell into keto and learned SO MUCH from people here on this sub.  I still have a ways to go ... BUT HOLY MACARONI I'VE LOST 100 LBS IN 6 MONTHS.  (And I ain't no spring chicken either - I'm 47.   If I can do this - with zero exercise mind you - it is entirely possible for anyone to be successful with keto.)

keto,I bought a bikini for the first time in my life!,"If you asked me a year ago if I would ever and I do mean EVER post a picture of myself on the internet in a bikini I would have laughed in your face. That would involve me wearing a bikini which would never happen... but yet here we are.

Before/After pic: (probably slightly NSFW) Side note: I’ve lost almost 100lbs so I have loose skin and stretch marks etc. but fuck it. If you don’t want to see that then fair warning to you before you click.

https://i.imgur.com/BgMIptU.jpg

If you’re thinking of starting keto...hopefully I can help convince you that it works. It worked for me, and in all honesty if I can do it then you most definitely can do it as well because I’m just a normal person who used to love carbs until I realized carbs do not love me back.

Now on the real, my body is not ‘perfect’ and there is still a big part of me that feels like I shouldn’t be posting a picture in a bikini. I’ve always been overweight and it’s really hard to get to a point where I don’t feel like I am and am always going to be the ‘fat girl.’

Ive started to realize now though that perfect is a myth though and this has helped me go from hating my body to finally giving it the love and acceptance it deserves. Jiggly parts and all!

Keto has changed my life in so many ways that I never expected and it can change yours too. It’s not going to always be easy but it will be 1000 % worth it.

Bikini pics 👙 on r/keto are optional, but highly recommended if you’re looking for a liberating but some what terrifying experience.

P.S I’m off to the Philippines tomorrow. Please wish me luck in avoiding carbs. If anyone has any keto friendly local food recommendations send them my way.

She often offers me homemade pie, bread, etc.  which I used to accept and then give to someone else.  A few weeks ago I finally told her about keto and she's been cordial but seems slightly concerned.  This morning she was planting  potatoes and she said, ""Are you still on that crazy diet?""  ""Yes.""  ""So I imagine you don't eat potatoes.""  ""No.""  ""Or my pie.""  ""No.""  ""So it's more like a lifestyle now.""  ""Exactly.  I really don't even have any cravings anymore.""  She asked exactly what I did eat.  And we got into a discussion about the food and only eating when hungry.  About an hour later she came knocking on my door.  She made me a completely Keto broccoli, ham and cheese omelette and almond flour muffin.  She had gone out on the internet to find out what I could eat and get recipes!!!!

I have two boys who were 3 and 8 months when I decided to give Keto a try for health reasons in addition to weightloss. 

Just a year later and I’m “normal” weight range for the first time since I was about 14 years old. My IBS is almost entirely resolved (still some issues related to gallbladder removal). Last month I reapplied for life insurance and qualified for top tier. I’m in perfect health! I’m 6 weeks out from running my first half-marathon. I quit my day job and make a living weightloss coaching people with my program and website. Can’t wait to see what the next year brings!

I always used to hate my body and struggled a lot with self-esteem. Yeah, I look better now, but most importantly I am just in awe as to how much one's body can change when you take care of it. Most other times when I have lost weight on crash diets and what not, I never really gained any self-esteem. I still felt terrible physically and mentally. A diet is so much more than just losing weight. It really does impact almost every facet of your life. I finally found a way of eating that really permeated my life in a really positive way.

So I have been Keto for about a year now. I definitely have not been really strict, and I have been on and off of it. But I have lost about 33 pounds (which is a lot for us short girl!). And I have absolutely fallen in love with the process of getting healthy and cherishing the beautiful thing that is my body. 

NSVs: My sciatica is mostly gone; my low blood sugar is gone; the numbness and tingling in my limbs is gone; My energy is back; I've learned how to cook pretty proficiently, and now cook 99% of all my meals; I feel confident in my body; I care about the actual health of my body; my libido is back; i fit in all of my clothes again (closet shopping FTW!)...the list could really go on for a long time, but I thought those were the most important and relatable ones. 

This sub has really been my rock during this process--seriously love all of you guys. I still want to lose about 10-15 more pounds, but I don't care as much about that anymore. I just want to keep feeling great and not get diabetes.

keto,[Pics] Surgery update! From 300 to thigh gap,"Update is finally here!!

[PICS](https://imgur.com/a/HuxSR)

Journey has been 4.5 years with the almighty keto. 
I lost 130lbs and recently had tummy tuck surgery to remove excess skin from my abdomen. This is my update. 
Here is link to original post [fuck Friday this can’t wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7g4he9/fuck_friday_this_cant_wait_today_is_the_day/?st=JC8BEF5E&sh=94a5e6ec) 

I have recovered with flying colors. 
Going for my 6 week final post op appt tomorrow. Feels great!!
I am so happy with my results!! My surgeon did an exceptional job. 
With keto, I finally gained control of my life and lost 130lbs. I’m so happy to be finally reaping the full benefits of my hard work and dedication. 
Many details a lot of people never even think about: For the very first time in my life I have a waist and hips!!! Also, I now have a lap. My twin niece&nephew were able to climb into my lap comfortably together on Christmas. I don’t have to worry about my stomach making weird skin slapping noises when I move or exercise. No more wearing deodorant under my belly.  
Warning!!! NSFW details: When reaching between my legs you feel fun bits instead of just belly. And...I feel cute in panties! A seemingly small detail of femininity I was never privy to which is really a huge challenge (now addition) to self-confidence. 

A literal and metaphorical weight was lifted off me. I feel like I have a second chance at being the healthy and happy person I’ve always wanted to be. 

Surgery details: My surgeon removed 10lbs of excess skin from abdomen. He did not need to tighten my abdominal muscles. And he did not do any liposuction. Both were “possibly needed” pre-surgery but deemed unnecessary once in. It was a 2 hour outpatient procedure.  I had 2 drains afterwards. One removed after 6 days, the other removed after 20 days. I had a novocaine pump in me for the first week.  

For those curious about the recovery:
I went to hell and came back. The pain was surprising honestly. I was under the impression I would feel most pain around the incisions. Boy was I wrong. Incisions are numb. Even still, lots of numbness along there as my nerves are reattaching themselves. The pain was the shocking feeling of tendons and fascia stretching, tugging, and pulling across my abdomen. After the initial surgery drugs wore off, I couldn’t stand up straight for almost 2 weeks. It was hell. At the time I said to everyone I wouldn’t recommend this surgery to anyone who does not need it drastically. It’s very painful and debilitating. You will not be able to work for at least 2 weeks. And after that it will be challenging and often painful for 2 more weeks or more. And that’s coming from a healthy 27 year old who healed fast. 
On the other side of recovery, im ECSTATIC with my results. My surgeon did an exceptional job!!!

keto,"Got a skydiving ticket for Christmas and was over their weight limit, so I couldn't jump. 7 months and almost 70lbs later, I've scheduled that jump for this coming Sunday!","The limit in their jumps was 220, I started keto shortly after the first of the year not as a ""New Years Resolution"" but more out of general frustration, unrelated to the jump.

I started at a little over 260, at my heaviest I was 286 but some recent work had brought me down a bit.  As of writing this I weight 196 which is the lowest I've been in almost 4 years.  

I had forgotten about the ticket and limit until recently on my birthday, when I remembered I had it and went to check.  I saw their weight limit and thought ""Thank god I followed through with this"", I feel so relieved that I can participate in those sort of activities now.  It's even motivating some of my other family to do it too!

I did strict keto, no alcohol, no cheats for 5 months.  I've relapsed a bit into ""lazy"" keto since then and I've started to allow myself a cheat meal once or twice a month, but I'm still losing weight and hitting the gym 3-4 times a week so I've got no problems with that!

Stick to it!! It's worth it!  The amount of opportunities that open up for you can be endless, It's liberating!",foods
keto,My goal dress finally fits!!,"Hey all! 

It’s me again..

Just wanted to show y’all that my goal dress actually fits now! I bought this about September  2019 3 sizes too small to use as a goal dress and to see over time how it starts to fit easier. 

Well I tried it on last night and she fits!! 
I pulled it off the hanger and just held my breath while slipping it on, I was just not wanting to get my hopes up. 

I’m so happy and surprised that it finally fits and I just wanted to share with everyone!

Getting a goal outfit was my main motivation. I bought this dress because my size (3X) was always sold out. So I decided to get it 3 times smaller and held onto it until I reached that size. Such a motivational thing for me. 


Here’s my goal dress (:

keto,As of this morning I've lost 101 lbs in 8 months!,"**Edit/update a couple of months later for those that stumble on this post: Since making this post I have completely cut out my pudding treats at night, and most sugar alcohols, because they were causing cravings. I've also started to add vegetables into my diet via sauteed spinach, drenched in butter and salt. It's delicious and I love eating it. I also started taking multivitamins.**

First, [the photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/1n4cfhS), because that's what we all care about the most! (There are 3 images in the gallery.)

So, I was *not* expecting to reach this milestone this morning! I was still a couple of pounds away when I weighed in 2 days ago, so I figured I still had another couple of days to go. Coincidentally today is my 8 month keto anniversary! 

I started at 375 on Feb 26, and this morning the scale read 274!

**My story**

I have struggled with my weight for around 2 decades at this point. I've tried so many different ways to lose weight, but ultimately I had difficulty sticking to anything I tried. Much of this has to do with my ADHD -- I get excited about new things and can stick to them for short periods of time, but as soon as the newness wears off, or I get bored, I'm back to my old habits. 

The only time I had success was in 2003 when I started Atkins. It seemed to really work with my body and the weight melted off. I lost 52 lbs that go around. I eventually fell out of doing Atkins because I allowed myself to fall into the low carb product craze. I would eat a ton of low carb ice cream or candy and the cravings for sweet things would come rushing back. Eventually I found myself saying, ""I can have a little bit of real ice cream"" and then would finish off the tub. 

Over the next 14 years my weight [continued to climb](https://i.imgur.com/q2XzJLH.png). I had mild success, but would always gain the weight back, and then it would keep going up. 

Eventually I hit a point emotionally and mentally that I was done being fat. I mean, I had hit this point many times, but it was different this time. I didn't want to die prematurely and leave my two young kids without a father. I was tired of waking up with my back in pain. I was tired of being unattractive (I had also gotten divorced about a year and a half before starting keto).

So, I started keto, and that was the day my life changed forever. 

For some reason I was able to stick to it this time. It was easy. I love the food I eat, and I no longer crave sugar and carbs. I can turn down cookies and ice cream and candy with ease. For me, Keto was the answer. 

**How did I do it?**

Consistency, mostly. 

*Carbs* - I eat 20 grams of net carbs or less most days. The days I go over it is never more than 60 net grams, and I always get back on track the next day. 
    
*Tracking* - I track every single thing I eat. And I do it immediately after eating it, otherwise I'll forget about it and forget to track it. I've tracked 227 days in a row at this point. (Early on there were 4 days in a row where I didn't track right away, and eventually forgot what I had eaten those days, which is why my streak isn't a long as I've been doing keto.)
    
*Water* - I drink a ton of water, and I use Mio water enhancers to make it palatable. This helps keep me full when I'm in between meals. And keeps my hydrated. 
    
*Gum* - I chew a ton of sugar free gum. This helps when I'm craving something to chew on but am not hungry. 
    
*Simplicity* - I eat pretty much the exact same meals every single day. This makes it easy for me. Yeah, I could use more variety, but I enjoy what I eat, so it's not so bad. And I do add some variety on occasion, when I can afford a steak or when I have the time and motivation to make something more complicated. 
    
*Cravings* - I try to stay away from sweet things. I still indulge in sweet treats like sugar free Jello, as well as sugar free pudding, but if I eat these too often the cravings come on strong, and I go overboard -- especially on the pudding, since it has carbs. Now, I try to stay away from the pudding, because I know it's hard for me to eat just one. 
    
*Calories* - I keep my calories within a reasonable range. I know this one is a tad controversial here, since the idea is that with keto and high fat you naturally don't eat as much, so you shouldn't need to track your calories. That's how I did it for the first half, but I decided I wanted to speed up the process a little, and started keeping my calories below 2000 per day, on average over a week. Eventually I started lowering this number, and now I'm pretty consistently below 1800 per day on average. 

*Fat* - I try to eat at least 60% of my calories in fat. This keeps me more full throughout the day.
    
**What do I eat?**

I've found that sticking to the same meals every day is the easiest way for me to be successful. This is what a typical day looks like for me.

*Breakfast:*
- 8 strips of bacon
- 1 premiere chocolate protein shake
- mixed with 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk

*Lunch:*
- 1 quarter lb hamburger patty from Costco
- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt
- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce

*Dinner:*
- 1.5 quarter lb hamburger patties from Costco
- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt
- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce
- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk

*Snacks:*
- 2 polly-o string cheese
- 2 cups sugar free jello
- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk

I hope this was helpful for those of you just starting out, or those of you finding yourself in need of some extra motivation!

I was going to wait another five pounds so I could do my 100 pound celebration, but today was just too awesome not to share. See, I fit into a pair of size 12 jeans for the first time in eight years.

In the first photo I was 232 lbs, 18 pounds shy of my eventual max of 250. The after is today about 60 seconds after I accidentally slipped right into a pair of size 12's. Today I weigh 155.

I bought them to tuck away into my bottom drawer as my 'one day' pants. When I got home and held them up I snorted. ""Oh, these are little girl pants! Maybe if I ever lose twenty pounds."" I just wanted to try them on to see how far I had to go. I haven't worn jeans since I grew past my size 22's years ago.

They slipped right up! I actually froze when they easily cleared my butt and hips. Paused for a moment, then tentatively tried to button them. They buttoned and zipped up like they were made for me.

Three minutes later I was sitting on the floor of my closet blubbering happy, snotty tears of joy into the phone with my daughter on the other end. She sent me this 'before' pic - that I'd totally forgotten existed - in response. ""Stop telling me you don't see a difference!!""

I think I can safely say that I'm not fat anymore. I'm really not fat. Not even 'chubby'. I dare say, I think I actually look good! Everything from here on out is gravy.

I'll do a better write up and after photos when I hit the 100 pound mark and then I'll tell the story of how my body fell apart and how I found my way home again. But for today I'll just say...

So I tried the keto diet, but working at fast food.. I broke it so many times since January. However, I started talking to this girl from U of T who I really had a huge crush on immediately. I was so excited to meet her in 3 months back in late May. I told her I was out of Canada and had to post pone until August. This gave me enough time to lose some weight, so I was determined to go back to my old weight of 170 lbs by the time I met her. I used her as motivation for weight loss & I decided to stick with the diet and fight the temptation of eating sugar/carbs. I was losing weight for her, and not entirely my self.

keto,"Here's a detailed list of keto-friendly foods I eat on a regular basis with pics, tips and recipes [Pics, FP]","Full Disclosure:

* I don’t have extravagant or complicated cooking sessions.
* I keep things as simple as possible to help save me time so the things I eat daily are not complicated.
* I’m also not a picky eater at all and enjoy the taste of everything.

#1. An ~~apple~~ avocado a day keeps the doctor away

* I used to avoid avocados because of their high fat content, but now I often eat one avocado a day, usually as the first thing to break my fast (“breakfast”) and it’s shockingly filling. They are quite literally, the perfect low carb, keto-friendly food. They have very few net carbs, lots of fiber, and it’s mostly just fat. Not just any fat though, it has a magnificent fat profile of mostly monounsaturated fats. (This is the stuff olive oil has a lot of too.)

* I eat avocados with some...
 * [Salt & Pepper \(pictured here\)](http://i.imgur.com/Ewk66FF.jpg) or
 * Soy Sauce or
 * Lemon Pepper

**How to buy and rotate avocados so you always have some ripe ones:**

* I buy 6-8 avocados at a time because it takes several days for them to ripen and I like to have a good supply.
* An easy way to check if they’re ripe without having to smash the skin is to simply push down on the brown stem (if there is one). If it goes down, it’s ready.
* If too many avocados are ripening and you want to slow down the process, throw them in the fridge! As simple as that.
* With that trick in mind, I usually have 5-10 avocados in the fridge and 5-10 over the counter so that I have a constant supply.

**If you have too many avocados that have ripened, make guacamole! Guamacole is super easy to make!**

* Mash up all the ripe avocados together
* Add some lime
* Add some minced up cilantro and you’re good to go!
* If you’re at a (mexican) restaurant and they serve chips and guacamole, tell them you don’t want the chips, but order some chicken or steak with it and dip it into the guac! Delicious.

#2. Eggs

Normally I eat 2-3 eggs, a few times a week. They too, like avocados, are a very keto-friendly food. They have zero carbs and are highly nutritious with an excellent amino acid (protein) profile.

[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/VsZZOxX.jpg) are some fluffy hard boiled eggs with some salt and pepper. Simple and delicious. If I’m boiling eggs for the day, I will boil some extra ones at the same time to keep for egg salad (recipe below).

**Other keto friendly ways I prepare eggs?**

* Scrambled or sunny side up, fried with coconut oil.
* Omelette with cheese/veggies
* Poached eggs (w/ Hollandaise sauce) (Basically “eggs benedict” without the English muffins.)
* Egg salad (below!)

#3. Egg Salad

This makes for a nice lunch idea that’s easy to customize and takes barely a few minutes to make because you just mash the ingredients together.

* [Before (Just soft boiled eggs and avocado)](http://i.imgur.com/ujs445F.jpg)
* [After \(mash up eggs, avocado and mayonnaise\)](http://i.imgur.com/fOPn4Th.jpg)

**Recipe: Mash up all these ingredients together:**

* 1 Avocado
* 2 Soft-Boiled Eggs (hard boiled works too but soft is creamier)
* 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
* Optional: add garlic salt and pepper
* Optional: add some shredded Cheddar Cheese
* Optional: add cayenne to taste for spicyness

#4. Simply Delicious Vegetables

The following are common, non-starchy vegetables that I eat regularly:

* [Asparagus & Brussels Sprouts](http://i.imgur.com/xsMIkd6.jpg)
* [Broccoli & Cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/kyR51l4.jpg)

**How do I prepare these guys? Easy! I bake them!**

Don’t be scared of ovens, people, it’s stupid-easy to bake things! Just follow the simple steps below:

* Preheat the oven to 400F.
* In a small bowl, mix a few tablespoons of **Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Soy Sauce together.**
* Optional: add some minced garlic, maybe some ginger depending on the veggies used.
* Put the veggies in a big bowl and pour this small bowl of oil and soy sauce into the veggies and mix it well.
* Put the veggies on a pan with Parchment Paper for 400F for 15 minutes.
* And that’s it! Ta-daaaa! See how easy it was?
* I personally like the EVOO and Soy Sauce, but you could also just put it all with BUTTER, too. That’s keto friendly, too. Oftentimes the veggies are actually there to act as a carrier for the butter.

#5. Blueberries! The Keto-Candy.

[Frozen blueberries are my favorite little snack!](http://i.imgur.com/GTbRzYg.jpg) I love the crunch they provide and since they’re so cold, I can’t eat a bunch of them because then I’ll get brain freeze. This also reminds me to treat berries like candy, so I eat them sparingly and usually NOT daily. When they’re on sale, I stock up on a bunch of them, wash them and keep them in the freezer. (I eat raspberries and strawberries sometimes too, but blueberries are my jam, without the jam.)

#6. Baked Fish

Fish is something I have ~3x a week that I’m always trying to eat more of. On the days that I don’t eat fish, I take a fish oil capsule to get more Omega 3’s in my diet.

* [This was a fillet of Alaskan Salmon surrounded by potatoes for the non-keto guests.](http://i.imgur.com/R686JDM.jpg) :)
* [I was at a friends and I suggested we bake some fish \(tilapia\), brussels sprouts and mushrooms and they didn’t even know we were eating a totally keto-friendly meal!](http://i.imgur.com/UmZV8cJ.jpg)

**Here’s how I bake fish (you could do this to fillets or whole fish):**

* Preheat the oven to 375F
* Rub salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon and blackened fish seasoning on both sides of the fish.
* Bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes.
* Done! How easy is that!

**Other fish choices:** I don’t eat tuna anymore because Wild Sardines in Olive Oil and Smoked Sprats are superior in every way. They are lower on the food chain than tuna and don’t accumulate toxins (such as mercury) and have a superior Omega 3 to 6 ratio! (Btw, I used to buy Riga Sprats but turns out they are stored in rapeseed oil, which is a terrible vegetable oil to eat, not only cause rape is bad, but it’s mostly bad fats… so no more of that brand!)

#7. Salmon and Cream Cheese (And Avocado!?)

* [In this photo I put salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions and some aleppo pepper on a big piece of lettuce to make a dank meal.](http://i.imgur.com/jH2zTVF.jpg) 
* Normally people eat the above ingredients sandwiched between a bagel. But you can’t have a bagel on a keto diet. Bagels are just bread. Fuck bread. Why would I want that stuff getting in the way of the deliciousness in the middle?

**Ingredients:**

* Smoked Salmon Lox
* Cream Cheese
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Optional: Chopped Green Onions (Scallions)
* Optional: Capers
* Optional: Avocado
* Optional: If you want a “carrier”, you could put it all on a piece of lettuce.

#8. Cheese and Olives

I’ve been eating [this Kerrygold Dubliner Irish cheese](http://i.imgur.com/p4De4mo.jpg) as a standalone snack. I love to get a big knife and make extremely thin slices of these. The taste is so complex and satisfying. (They are available on Costco. And speaking of Kerrygold brand, by the way, their Irish butter tastes really good too. All their products come from grass-fed cows.)

I may or may not eat this cheese with some olives. Olives have almost no net carbs and have a great fat profile, so they are a great little keto-friendly snack. I love the ones in brine.

#9. Cream Cheese and Bastirma (seasoned, air-dried cured beef)

One of my favorite dairy things is to get [cream cheese and mix it with some Armenian cured deli meat called Bastirma.](http://i.imgur.com/PRGjonz.jpg) This is one of those foods that are not well known if you’re not familiar with the culture, but it’s highly spiced, the slices are extremely thin and delicious with some cream cheese.

**Here are some other Middle Eastern Foods that are keto friendly:**

Since my father is Lebanese-Armenian and my mother is Armenian-Armenian, I know about some foods that others may not know about that are very low carb and these are my random faves:

* [Lebni / Labneh \(Strained yogurt\)](http://i.imgur.com/CHfi64w.jpg)
 * This is a type of kefir cheese, made in a similar process as Greek Yogurt, but it tastes much more tart, like sour cream. Traditionally it’s spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and topped with some dried mint.  I personally think it’s dank as fuck.
* [Sujuk / Soujoukh / Yershik](http://i.imgur.com/kTZKT95.png)
 * This is type of highly spiced, dried beef sausage that you could find at your local international market as well, probably in the deli section. I love to eat them with cream cheese.

**Note:** One of the main drawbacks of deli meat, or highly processed meats is that their protein becomes inferior and a lot of important minerals (like potassium and magnesium) are lost as well, so I don’t make them my main source of protein.

#10. Nuts: Macadamia’s and Almonds

* As you know, when one is on a low carb diet, they should replace those calories with fat and nuts are predominantly high in fat. The top two nuts that are very low in carbs AND have a very healthy fat profile are macadamia’s and almonds!

* [Macadamia Nuts that are Dry Roasted with Sea Salt](http://i.imgur.com/BQSWxxn.jpg) are one of my favorite snacks. They taste like butter balls that are perfectly salted. (~20cals each)
* I *love* [these Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds.](http://i.imgur.com/5R4Huha.jpg) I always get a pound of these that last me the month.
* [These Marcona Almonds with Rosemary](http://i.imgur.com/fOgGA9G.jpg) are a bit pricey, but have an incredibly luxurious taste. Marcona almonds are fried in olive oil, by the way.

* **Warning for those trying to lose weight:** Nuts are high in calories and it’s easy to “accidentally” eat a few hundred calories of these if you are just munching mindlessly. Even if you practice severe carbohydrate restriction, eating more calories than you need can result in fat gain. (I still use MyFitnessPal when I want to ensure weight loss even on keto, but that's just me, YMMV)

You could have other nuts too, like cashews and peanuts for example. But as dank as they are, I can’t go to town on them cause they’re somewhat higher in net carbs, so I eat them very sparingly and infrequently. If I’m going to have peanuts, I usually opt for peanut butter, actually. And on occasion, I go for cashew butter. [\(relevant peanut butter related meme\)](http://i.imgur.com/GZO0Hfu.jpg)

#11. Milk Alternatives for when I want a creamy drink

**[Unsweetened flax, coconut, soy, hemp, cashew, almond milks.](http://i.imgur.com/FajoKSy.jpg) (We live in good times to have access to such variety!)**

* Note that ALL of these must specifically say **“UNSWEETENED”** on their label. The beauty of these are that they are only 30-45 calories per cup.

* **Coconut Milk:** In the summertime, there’s something so brisk and refreshing about coconut milk. (It reminds me of summer, probably thanks to all those dark tanning products that smelled like coconut oil.)
* **Hemp and Flax and Cashew milks:** I have only tried these a couple times, they are a bit more fatty, creamy, thick and I like them.
* **Almond milk** is my favorite. Some people don’t like it at all and that bewilders me, but… I like it and it’s a yummy drink to me. I sometimes will heat up a cup and drink it *hot.*
* **Soy Milk** is my go to when I’m looking for a more hearty drink (clocking in at 100cals/cup), I really like unsweetened soy milk. It’s also great to add to your tea so it’s like a chai-latte. Protip: If you live near some Asian stores, you can find unfiltered soy milk which tastes like the real thing. But you must make sure it’s not sweetened.

#12. Arugula Salad

[This is stupid easy to make.](http://i.imgur.com/GdU98Eg.jpg) I just added arugula and avocado and salt & pepper and olive oil. How easy is that? Really easy.  You could also do something similar with spinach. Loves me some spinach.

#13. Keto-Friendly Foods On The Go

If I’m on the go, I usually don’t have hunger and can get away with several hours without eating but… if I do...

* I like Quest Bars, specifically the Choc Chip Cookie Dough flavor. They are the only truly keto-friendly bars that I know of. (Edit: Costco carries Kirkland Protein Bars that are similar to these apparently and much cheaper!)
* Sunflower seeds (I love the cracked pepper version) found at most gas stations, are quite a good snack if you like spitting sunflower shells.
* If you’re not a fan of spitting sunflower shells, already-shelled-for-you roasted and salted sunflower seeds/kernels are also pretty delicious too. These also are found at gas stations. Just make sure they don’t have added sugar.

**I also take an avocado with me sometimes. Here’s how to eat a ripe avocado without any tools:**

* Bite the skin at the top to remove it and spit it out.
* Squeeze the avocado out from the bottom up. Eat it as it comes out the top hole.
* Eventually the seed will come out as well and you just keep squeezing it out into your mouth and into the trash or straight into the trash.
* **Fair warning:** Keep the avocado in a place that won’t get mashed in your bag by other things or else it will make a mess. Ask me how I know. :P (Maybe even put it in its own zip lock bag or something)

#14. Mineral Management and Daily Supplements

Mineral management is especially important on a ketogenic diet to prevent feeling fatigue (especially before strength or endurance training) or if you’re not feeling well while in ketosis. These are the following things I take:

* **Multivitamin:** I supplement with a daily one-a-day multivitamin to cover my bases.
* **Sodium & Potassium:** It’s no coincidence that many foods I eat are somewhat higher in sodium overall, and that’s because the kidneys excrete more than usual while in ketosis and so I make up for it with the higher sodium intake. But, to not get too much sodium, I use “LoSalt” instead of regular salt because it’s more potassium in it and half the sodium (salt) which makes for a better balance. I also drink bone broth almost daily.
* **Magnesium:** Two of [these magnesium pills a day](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Absorption-Magnesium-Elemental-240-Count/dp/B000BD0RT0/) (400mg) for 20 days will help stabilize magnesium levels. This improves almost every cellular process in your body (especially important for sleep and muscle cramps). This is doubly important on keto due to the kidneys excreting faster than usual.
* **Fish Oil:** If I did not eat fish that day, I’ll take 1-2 capsules of fish oil which has lots of omega 3’s in each capsule. 
 * **Advisory:** Many fish oil brands will say “1200mg” but really, only 300mg of it will only be Omega 3 fatty acids. So read the labels to make sure you're getting one with high DHA/EPA!
* **Protein:** If I haven’t ate much protein or I had a particularly hard strength training day, I will drink a scoop of [vegan protein powder](https://truenutrition.com/p-1169-vegan-protein-optimizer-formula-1lb.aspx) and add raw cacao and chia seeds in a blender bottle. The unflavored one tastes really blah but the chocolate or french vanilla flavored ones are a good powder that gets the job done with minimal fuss.

#15. Special mention for Fiber

If I’m feeling like I ate too many things that don’t have any fiber (read: meat, cheese, etc) and feel constipated, then I will have 1-2 teaspoons of organic psyllium husk mixed in water. It’s pure fiber which causes me to poop gloriously sometime later that day.

**ProTip:** Nowadays, if I’m going traveling or camping, I will take a zip lock bag of this stuff with me and my bowel movements won’t feel disrupted from the traveling and it works incredibly well. ([relevant meme](http://i.imgur.com/OAgPvtS.jpg))

###Well, that wraps it up

* Now you know what I eat on a regular basis. All this info above was from a blog post that I published yesterday titled [""What I Actually Eat""](http://antranik.org/what-i-actually-eat/) but since self promotion is not allowed on this sub, I took the hour here to make it reddit-friendly.
* If you're missing an ingredient or curious to know exactly which product I use, there are a billion links (mostly on Amazon) in the official article.
* If you like my writing style, here's a link to the [beginners guide I created for the keto diet](https://redd.it/4vhrv5) that was very well received. Hope that helps!

keto,Keto Changed Me. It’s My 18th Birthday and Prom’s Tonight. Dropped 82 lb,"I’ve been doing keto since September 1, 2017 and have lost about 82 pounds. Originally my goals were to lose >30 pounds by the end of 2017 and >50 by my birthday. Beat both of those goals by about 50 pounds. I did it with keto, intermittent fasting, and extended water fasting (longest I’ve gone is a week). It’s not been super easy, and man I’ve had some real bad setbacks (2 of which were >10 pounds gained), but I’ve just about made it to my goal. Once I get under 200 I plan on hitting the gym hard and putting some carbs in my diet (and a lot of protein) to gain muscle quick. Do that for 5ish months, then shred the rest of the year with keto. I might post again on New Years or something. 
Also a tip: find close friends who can keep you accountable. One of my best friends has kept track of my progress since I started and boy I couldn’t have done it without him. Find people who really want the best for you. 
It’s funny... me and my friends had a running joke “lose the weight for a hot prom date.” Obviously not my only motivation but it gave me something to look forward to. If you asked me then who I’d like to take out of anyone, I would have told you this girl Rachel. Just a few weeks ago me and those friends did a big promposal for Rachel (from me), she says yes, and we’re gonna go on a date after. I don’t think keto has nothing to do with this. Hmmmm. 
But anyway thanks for reading this, KCKO! I’ll respond to all the comments as soon as I can, but today is my birthday and I do have a hot date. 
P.S. I know I look like an idiot with my tongue out in the first pic. And in the other one it looks like I have a really pointy nipple. That’s my arm. Also my hair looks bad cuz I ain’t washing it until right before I pick Rachel up. 

Edit: I’m not gonna just pig out on crap when I hit my goal. I’m talking like a cup of brown rice or sweet potato before and after working out. That’s what most jacked Youtubers say, what my twin brother says (who loves keto and is way more jacked than I), and also what a nutritionist told me who did keto to lose a ton of fat. Also I may or may not follow up with prom pics tomorrow. Maybe if this hits 1000 upvotes I will ;) haha kidding. If I’m feeling it I will. But definitely if it hits 1k. Also my flair now says 18!

keto,Down 200 lbs in 1 year naturally with diet and exercise. From 438 lbs to 238 lbs!,"[Before And After Picture (438 lbs to 238 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/j75bxFC)

This week I have weighed in at 238 LBS, which officially puts me at a total loss of exactly 200 pounds! A lot of hard work and dedication has led me to where I am today, and although I’m still not finished my journey (~ 20-30ish pounds to lose) I am truly grateful and proud of what I have been able to accomplish up to this point, and for how much my life has improved as this journey has gone on. 

After doing Keto and any other diet technique, one thing I have continued to stick with, as mentioned in my [initial update](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app); is IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day) while keeping CICO in mind (Calories In Calories Out). In terms of exercise, I was doing a 5 day ULPPL (Upper Lower Push Pull Legs) Bodybuilding Routine alongside post-lifting cardio, usually HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), on at least 3 of those days. Also, I try to remain active and ideally get some form of cardio in through sports or whatever else I can on my rest days. And this is all done in a fasted state to help burn calories/fat more efficiently and boost metabolism etc. 

I have faced plenty of adversity during this journey, though have nonetheless stayed relentless in achieving my goals. The love and support I have received from this community in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) has definitely helped push me to work that much harder and something I will never take for granted. 

I really want to set an example for how much power we all have within us, whether it’s related to weight loss or not; we all have the potential to accomplish such great things that often isn’t realized. Whatever it is you desire to accomplish, whether it’s losing/gaining weight or whatever else, please remember how much YOU yourself are capable of, and to never sell yourself short. Realize your potential and realize it is never too late to make a change or better yourself. 

I‘ve constantly been trying to lose weight practically my whole life, since I was just a child, and the best decision I made was to never give up. Now here I am today, not at the end of my journey, but several steps ahead of where I was when I started and constantly pushing forward. Will be updating you guys again once I reach my final goal weight (~ 20-30ish lbs away), until then wishing the best to each and every one of you in your journeys, stay blessed! 🙏❤️",foods

Coffee,An update for you pretentious fucks,"I posted here last week asking for recommendations for fancy coffee. A lot of comments mentioned how important it was to go get some freshly roasted beans, so I did.

There's a little Italian market in my city that has a ton of different freshly roasted beans for only $10 a pound. I picked out some medium roast from somewhere in south america that said something about some low acidic bullshit and went with it.  

I also watched a video online of how to use my french press properly. It was this dude talking for 8 minutes and the only thing I learned was it's important to stir up the grounds when it's steeping.  I could've gotten the point across in 10 seconds.

ANYWAYS, I made my first batch yesterday and I have another batch steeping right now. The coffee was good, not amazing but I could taste some deeper notes than a normal drip coffee.

I drank a french press full, then made another batch for my girlfriend but she couldn't drink all of it cause it was very strong, so I chugged half of that before I went out the door to my workout.

Holy shit I have never felt such a caffeine buzz. I felt amazing on my way to my workout, made it a point to talk to people when usually I'm still groggy in the morning and I felt great throughout. 

Anyways, thought I'd share. What a pleasant surprise that I actually felt a caffeine buzz on top of better tasting coffee. I'm excited to keep buying freshly roasted beans and try something new every time.

Then today I switched from properly ground, quality coffee through my shitty coffee maker to weighing my coffee and water and using a clever, and it's the best coffee I've ever had now. If within a year I buy an espresso maker I'm holding all of you accountable. Bastards...",foods
Coffee,My journey of growing coffee at home. In low altitude. In a suburban backyard.,"So I've thought for a little while now I'd post a bit about this, just because really. Hopefully it may be a nice read for those keen to try growing themselves.

My wife and I recently built our first home and my wish was to get some coffee trees because I thought they look nice and it would be a cool feature - I didn't intend nor expect to grow coffee, I'm just a coffee nerd.

We ended up buying 3 arabica trees from a local but 'fancy pants' garden center, of which they have a perhaps 3m tree growing extremely well. We took them home and planted them up. We were happy.

&#x200B;

[Basic garden for basic people. This was from March 2018.](https://preview.redd.it/f85jm37v2o351.jpg?width=769&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f25eb78cbce78558e3649fe424651bcab3662a56)

So we let them grow. My wife toiled away on the garden, giving each plant some love (i.e. not the coffee specifically) and we were greeted with some flowers. The smell was light but sweet. Very similar to the jasmine you can see in the fore in the above image (or it could've just been overwhelming). Luckily Coffee is a self-fertilising crop so I was keen to see some cherries.

It was right around this time that our adopted ex-racing greyhound decided that one of the trees was a little too loud and she bit it in half. You can see in the above image the free in front (inline with the non-racing dog) is much smaller than the ones behind.

&#x200B;

[First bud](https://preview.redd.it/oihwvzc73o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d3d180b3b566feb818f1d1e342967cff8024bd5)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k3w0rx093o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4df5d9061930aaca7e019f9b7254383be5e3457

Indeed we were cherry-parents. According to the date stamp, we got some decent green cherries growing around November 2018.

Here's a weird photo, but you get a good indicator of size vs a 6ft fence.

[19\/01\/2019.](https://preview.redd.it/eqqqtg7n3o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20bc0b33f184d02209a879e0759a0d69ea437190)

&#x200B;

[Check those babies out, starting to yellow!](https://preview.redd.it/e074gfdx3o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a59f5c31aa67d64b4e5d966fabb0eb2d0af68b4)

Apparently (again, according to EXIF date stamp), I pulped my first ever coffee cherry on the 11th of March 2019.

&#x200B;

[Much excite! You literally just squeeze the parchment coffee out.](https://preview.redd.it/1brz1nv34o351.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecfad3ebdad3aa15d83360cd32ab6c4575740ffa)

So here's where I'll start getting a bit more detailed. So far you can tell we essentially did nothing more than growing any other plant and we have some cherries. From everything I've read, trees can take between 3 to 5 years to fruit. The first harvest, of course is always the smallest.

&#x200B;

[My first ever haul of green.](https://preview.redd.it/fb0xu2jo4o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=94a8e9ea4a0e565334eef8bc3f4c25c67722a8d8)

So at this point, I had been home roasting for a few years and we were exclusively using my coffee for our daily brew, outside of a few random bags of filter I'd purchase. Needless to say I was keen as mustard to roast my own, but not in the Behmor. They'd get nuked, so in the put they went and I basically executed them on the spot. Tipped and under-developed. It was a massacre and I was to blame.

My processing of this initial batch was basically washing. I would pick, pulp and air dry the parchment. I can't recall how long for but according to the EXIF again, it was slightly under a month.

Let us fast forward, because that's the beauty of time. This image is the 28th of January this year.

[Check out those cherries!](https://preview.redd.it/51xy06o85o351.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cdec9bb802863b8c38bd5be2d6f6617dc1f21750)

Boy, we had a haul coming! Check out that height! Even old Mr-snapped-in-half is doing well. The rear tree is smaller, perhaps we'll just call it a runt because I have no other explanation, but boy - what a haul.

&#x200B;

[I just like this photo because if you notice, in the reflection is my coffee machine.](https://preview.redd.it/o1iyoc4h5o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d12b81d86ecb5f82654e97f0fae8fbb658e369a)

So, so far we've basically just grown plants. We've done zero special to this coffee my wife wasn't already doing for everything else. Now I live in Brisbane. Sure it gets warm, but it's hardly the slopes of Mt Kenya or Finca Tamana. This means essentially anyone can grow coffee - apparently they even love indoors!

Our temperature range wouldn't be what I'd presume is ideal for coffee. We don't get frost which is great for coffee, winter would be lucky to get to 10 degrees C and summer is warm but we'd rarely hit 40c.

Oh right, covfefe.  Here's what happened to those cherries above, in April.

&#x200B;

[I can't help but think \\""grapes\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/t45yjj676o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e00352501f69fe9cac8f693e36e0a62974d7889f)

Stacked mate, totally stacked. But we need to wait.

&#x200B;

With a star-picket upgrade, our middle tree went bananas. We did an initial pick in May this year (Boy, it feels to far away already) and this was our haul. Again, I went washed because of simplicity.

&#x200B;

[Sadly, I didn't weigh.](https://preview.redd.it/i4cdpq4i6o351.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=226a515f935ce1aaeb273c8a845a765c8c65a169)

&#x200B;

We've completed a few odd picks, perhaps 3 large picks so far and over the last.. year I suppose, I've become friends with a coffee guru who just also happens to ride motorcycles and live locally (And be the nicest guy to boot). Danny Andrade threw me plenty of great tips so we split our processing methods.

And there you have it. 304 grams of coffee from our second harvest ever. It's yet to be roasted because, honestly I'm scared. I've been buying coffee for at least the last year and I'm concerned I'll torch it in the Behmor because it'll be so low-density. See, growing coffee on the sides of mountains isn't just because the soils are fantastically rich, it's also the height. The higher above see-level (MASL - Miles above sea level), the denser the bean. The denser the bean the better the taste because they're literally fuller of the matter that makes up the seed.

With growing coffee in lower areas, the plants don't struggle for oxygen as much, thus the seed is easier to produce and the result is a less dense or lighter bean. For a roaster, this means they'll need far less development time and a far gentler approach to heat. Tipping and scorching is far too easy in my home roasting trials of legitimate Australian coffee (I mean, from a real farm in Australia), so this still will burn like hair against a blow torch.

Next up is the Anaerobic fermentation parchment. This was a decent haul and my mate Danny offered to roast it for me, I felt that I had to give him a batch worth roasting. Plus he's a freaking guru at all things coffee so it's absurd to think I could even HOPE to approach his level of roasting skill at home, but I'm still keeping that first batch to kill myself because I feel it's something I need to do. Closure if you will.

Check out the colour on those. Parchment is a tough outer-skin on the coffee seed. Coffee farms sometimes wet-hull to remove this, but I lack the skills, equipment or motivation to even attempt this. Our fermentation batch is growing in slow increments as we're almost completely done picking but I hope with the fermentation, it produces a coffee that tastes of something other than shoe polish and road grime.

I hope my little coffee story has been at least entertaining and at most perhaps 3% inspiration to you if you've thought of trying to grow some yourself, because why not? Go on, be a cheat like me and buy it already 6 months old from a nursery. Sure it won't be green-tipped Geisha or SL28 (Danny reckons our trees could be Red Bourbon, did I mention he's a nice guy?) and you don't even have to harvest if you don't want to, but it's cool. Also, the bees seem to like it which is a nice bonus :)",foods

Coffee,"Almost exactly a year later after being diagnosed with COVID in early May 2020, my sense of smell finally has returned enough that coffee tastes/smells good again.","I made a thread about losing sense of smell due to covid awhile ago, back in 2020 when I was originally infected, and I'm happy to say that over the last month I'm FINALLY starting to be able to piece together the notes of coffee once again.

COVID caused me to develop anosmia for a few weeks while infected, but even after that left me with paranosmia - my brain interpreted smells in a way that was different compared to how it did previously.

Because of this, for basically the last year coffee has basically smelled and tasted like weak instant coffee, no matter the roast or grind or brewing method. Freshly ground beans just smelled like the way used, damp pourover grinds used to smell.

A year and two vaccinations later, and coffee is coming back finally. As of right now, the main note I'm getting from coffee is peanut, but I'll take peanut over nothing any day.

Coffee,"My favorite coffee lover, and the most generous person in the world, died yesterday","3 years ago I moved to the town I live in now and found a small, one-man coffee shop that made their own coffee beans. The owner, Tony, rested them in bourbon barrels (I’m in Kentucky) and they were the highest quality beans, which worked well for me because I have a bladder disease and can’t handle the additives. He was SO passionate in his love of coffee and making other people feel the love. On Christmas this past year, I bought 5 bags of coffee from him for presents (about $100 worth) and I went on and on about how I was getting myself a new Chemex coffee maker for Christmas. After my transaction, he handed me my bag and handed me $100 and told me, “merry Christmas, go get your coffee maker, my treat.” I cried in the shop and cried all the way home because I was so excited. He has done so much more for our community than I will go into on here, but I just wanted to give you a snippet of his generosity.

1. It would allow them to serve more people, quicker. With a black coffee line, they can get those customers in and out with ease, freeing up space in the regular line.

2. For the black coffee line, all you have to do is say what size you want, it’s poured, you pay, and you’re out of there, which in turn encourages those coffee drinkers to come to the store with the expectation that the experience will be quick.

3. Finally, in the line for everything else, they can already have all the flavors and cups ready so that they can attempt to service the complicated orders faster.

Coffee,"I turned coffee beans into ""chocolate"".","[Behold:](https://i.imgur.com/bhZz618.jpeg) these bars of ""chocolate"" have not a single gram of cocoa solids: I replaced the cocoa nib content with ground coffee beans, and it tastes absolutely incredible. [Sound on to bear witness to the *SNAP.*](https://imgur.com/a/bqwQXU4)

First I'll discuss the bar's attributes, briefly talk about the background, then tell you how I made it. I'll leave some additional notes at the end.

(If you're more the visual type, I made a [video about the process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzwnBFhq_5k&ab_channel=FluffyMunchkin) Just bear in mind that I have no cinematography experience, so it's not the sharpest production you'll see this week.)

**SMELL:** It smells like whole coffee beans. The scent has a roundness and smoothness to it.

**TASTE:** It tastes like, well, coffee. A strong coffee flavor that has a good balance between sweetness and bitterness: sorta akin to 75-80% dark chocolate, I'd wager. There's an initial hit of sweetness that becomes more mellow and bitter the longer you let it sit in your mouth, but not in an unpleasant fashion. I think the best description I can give would be ""moka brew in solid form"", given how the cocoa butter lends the coffee a full-bodied flavor and mouthfeel. (My roommate claimed it tasted like a ""super nutty espresso"", but I'm not educated enough on that topic to make any agreements.)

The difference in taste between bean types was quite apparent. I made a batch with a dark roast (unknown bean type), and a batch containing light roast Ethiopian beans. The dark roast I used has a bold, earthy, roasty taste. Contrasting this, the Ethiopian dark matter was tangy, fruity, with a slightly greater sweetness. I think I caught some strawberry notes in it, too.

**TEXTURE:** Exactly like chocolate. It melts easily in the mouth, a result of the cocoa butter's melting point. In a tempered state, it's smooth, glossy, and will break with a crisp snap.

**BACKGROUND:**

I'd made the decision to buy a melanger/wet grinder some time ago, with the intention of making coffee praline paste, given that food processors do a terrible job of adequately grinding coffee beans. It made me wonder if you could make chocolate using coffee beans, so I conducted a little research. There isn't much out there on the internet regarding this idea. I found that [ChefSteps *does* have a recipe for so-called ""dark matter"",](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/dark-matter) and there's [a blog that discusses ChefSteps' recipe.](https://www.gratuitousfoodity.com/2016/02/27/dark-matter-coffee-bean-chocolate/) 

But here's the catch: The blog mentions that unfortunately, the result is unpleasantly bitter to an unpalatable degree. Additionally, I found a [video by James Hoffmann](https://youtu.be/gAPy-xm3Qnk?t=210) / u/kingseven where he briefly mentions a similar result: ""It's not quite delicious"", he says.

That feedback made me decide to alter the original recipe, so here are the proportions I did:

200g coffee beans

200g cocoa butter

175g sugar

5g powdered vanilla beans

2g salt

0.5g liquid soy lecithin

(This is an alteration of 2/3 the original recipe. I didn't know how it would turn out, so I conserved the ingredients for future attempts.)

The original recipe makes a bar that's ""75%"" if you reason that the cocoa butter should be counted in addition to the coffee oil and solids content. My recipe makes a bar that's ~68%, by the same reasoning. Since the only real flavoring component was the coffee, I imagined that by reducing the source of the bitterness (coffee), and increasing the sugar, I could create a better balance between bitterness and sweetness.

I made two batches of the stuff with different beans. While all I have to go on for the identity of the first bean type is [this pic of the bag I'd sent to a friend,](https://i.imgur.com/qMMGlJK.jpg) I know it was a dark roast of some sort. The other bean type was an Ethiopian light roast, with a roast date of ~28 days ago. I'll note here that my thought process was ""if it'll work well with older beans, imagine how it'll taste with some quality stuff""!

The procedure for making the dark matter is quite easy. You grind the coffee as fine as you can. You melt the cocoa butter and add the soy lecithin to it, then mix to evenly disperse the lecithin. Add the cocoa butter to a melanger and let it run for a few minutes to lubricate the stones. Next, slowly add the coffee, then the remaining dry ingredients. Then you allow it to conch for hours-to-days to grind down the particle size to something like 15-20 microns. (You can find a bit more info on conching [here:] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conching#Process))

I conched my batch for 48 hours, scraping down the sides every so often. I don't have a tilting bowl mechanism on my melanger, so the mixture would start to solidify on the sides, and I needed to warm up the sides with a kitchen torch to remove the buildup.

After 48 hours, I removed as much chocoffee as I could, and attempted to temper it as if it were dark chocolate: 125F/51.6C, cool to 82F/27.7C, rewarm to 88F-91F/31.1C-32.7C, then pour into molds. 

I immediately made a few observations about the dark matter. First, it seemed to melt more readily than chocolate. Second, at 125F, the mixture had an odd consistency. It was very much like a thick chocolate ganache at the same temp. Only when it cooled to ~110F/43.3C did it start to gain fluidity similar to that of real chocolate. It behaved similarly to chocolate between the 80F-90F/26.7C-32.2C range. I also totally failed to temper it the first time around, and I'm pretty sure I know why...

Another observation I made was that dark matter heats up REALLY fast. I'm positive that the carryover heat took the mixture beyond the melting point of form V crystals. The second time around, I reheated the chocolate to 88.6F/31.4C. Placing the bowl over simmering water for a matter of seconds would result in a few degrees' change, so I had to be careful and gradual. I checked the temper before molding too; at this point, it wasn't 4AM anymore, and I was more awake.

I placed the molds in the refrigerator for ~30 minutes to crystallize, and voila! 

To ensure that it's not just my particular palate, I handed out samples to people I'm still in contact with during the pandemic. The responses were quite encouraging: an overwhelmingly positive response, with most people describing a good balance between flavor, sweetness, and bitterness.

**CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE BATCHES/ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS**

1. The blog I reference mentions the possibility of adding milk powder to the batch to create ""latte chocolate"". This is absolutely something I'd like to explore further, in addition to adding toasted milk powder and powdered caramel (caramel latte), or cocoa nibs (mocha bars). I have a bit more research to do about making milk chocolate before I attempt this.

2. I'm curious as to what degree conching time and the tempering process have an effect upon the volatile compounds in coffee. I think there might be a balance of ""just conched enough without losing too much flavor"", but I'm not positive. I wonder to what degree these compounds are soluble in cocoa butter. And I'm sure there's an effect of conching time on the product's final flavor, just like chocolate. Increased conching reduces astringency by evaporating some acids contained within cocoa nibs, and I'm sure there's a similar effect on coffee beans.

3. I'd be curious to see the flavor profiles of other types of beans in this confection. I think Sumatran beans would be neat.

4. I'm hoping to get my hands on a sous-vide sometime soon to more accurately ascertain the tempering range.

5. If you ever plan to use dark matter in pastry components (say, in a ganache), keep in mind that the cocoa percentage is similar to white chocolate, and adjust accordingly.

6. Be careful when eating copious quantities of the stuff. One of the 32g bars shown contains approximately 130mg of caffeine, and I dunno how the cocoa butter affects absorption. Between the sugar and caffeine content, these are like energy bars that'll send you bouncing off the walls.

8. I have to say, the name ""dark matter"" started to wear at me the longer I mulled it over. Calling my Ethiopian batch ""Ethiopian Dark Matter"", well, that just sounds wrong... I like the portmanteau of ""chocoffee"" a little better, but I'll continue to refer to it as dark matter as an attribution to the original ChefSteps creation.

7. Pricing of some of the ingredients or equipment I used:

- Melanger: $200

- Deodorized Cocoa Butter: $16.90

- Liquid Soy Lecithin: $6.83

- Coffee Beans: $8, but this could obviously be either slightly lower or far higher

- Jeweler's Scale: $13 (Although, you could get by with ~1/8th tsp of liquid soy lecithin)

**Condensed Recipe:**

""Dark Matter"" Recipe:

200g coffee beans

200g cocoa butter

175g sugar

5g powdered vanilla beans

2g salt

0.5g liquid soy lecithin

Grind coffee beans as finely as you can. Melt cocoa butter completely. Weigh out soy lecithin in a small amount of the cocoa butter, mix to combine, then add back to the main cocoa butter mass. Turn melanger on, and pour in melted cocoa butter. Allow the melanger to run for a minute to lubricate the stones.

Slowly add ground coffee to the melanger, then add the sugar, salt, and powdered vanilla. Conch for 48 hours, scraping down the sides every so often. Temper dark matter by heating to 125F/51.6C, cooling to 82F/27.7C, then reheating to 88F-91F/31.1C-32.7C. Check the temper with a metal spatula, then pour into molds. Refrigerate for 30+ minutes to crystallize.

One cup of regular coffee for me is like six cups in a row for someone else — I get the sweats, nausea, shaking so hard I have to lie down. 

A few years ago I had a cup of “decaf” to which I reacted this way. Not knowing whether my body’s sensitivity had skyrocketed (I’m disabled by MS and other things, so my reactions to things can change), or whether it was just a mislabeled cup, I gave up coffee entirely. 

I figured recently it was time to find out for sure. So I had my husband buy some new decaf and teach me how to use the Chemex. And ohhhhh the sweet delight of delicious, wonderful coffee without all the side effects of the caffeine! It definitely was an error in labeling that last time as I’ve had numerous cups since then and no problems at all.

Coffee,It all started with an ice cube.,"I don’t know where else to post this, but I kind of want to vent, so I decided to just let my thoughts out here in a community of people I don’t know and my post will most likely not be read anyways.

I used to wander into the kitchen at 4AM to see my dad sitting over the oven vent drinking his iced black coffee. I would ask him for a sip, and he would say ‘no’ to me because I was too young (I was around 6 years old?)— instead, he’d offer me a spoon of an ice cube from his coffee that I happily took and chewed on because it still had some hints of coffee on it and then I’d go back to bed. It became almost a routine thing where I would wake up early for that coffee coated ice cube with my dad. 
Years passed and when I became old enough to actually drink coffee, he showed me how he would make his instant coffee with 1:2:1 ratio of coffee, creamer, and sugar mix. In middle school, he had a newfound discovery and love for Starbucks and at one point, he would take me to Starbucks every day after picking me up from school to get a venti hot chocolate with extra cream while he got his venti coffee Frappuccino with extra coffee. He always radiated so much positive energy and was always smiling, all of the baristas knew him and would immediately greet him with excitement whilst getting ready to make his order before he even reached the cashier counter. 
In high school, my dad taught me how to brew Vietnamese iced coffee and would often make an extra serving for me whenever he brewed his own cup. I think about it now, and my addiction for coffee was never entirely due to the caffeine (coffee actually makes me sleepy). Rather than the taste, every time I drink coffee, I’m reminded of the story of how I grew up to love coffee with my dad. It all started with that spoon of coffee coated ice cube. I miss him so much. 

Some background, I suddenly lost my dad from cancer this year. I live in Nevada for school and my family lives in California. Shortly after his funeral, I had to go back to Nevada for school and work and I’ve been mourning his loss all alone in a place where I don’t have any friends or family. I’ve been having a really difficult time coping and never really had anyone to talk about my dad’s passing because it’s an uncomfortable topic that most people can’t relate to nor enjoy listening to, so I spent every day keeping to myself and going into work/school as I normally would with a huge smile. I honestly don’t feel okay and I really miss my dad. I hold so much regret for not finishing school (college) in time, not getting married, not being successful in his lifetime, and so on— but it’s been a few months now since his passing, and I’ve never been more motivated to push through school and work to live a successful life that he wished for me. To anyone who bothered to read my post, I apologize if i was a mood killer to your day, but I appreciate you for listening to my inner thoughts and I hope you have a great rest of your day. :)

If I could, I wish I could give it back to you, but please know that you brought a huge smile to my face and made my day!

I miss my dad every day, but there are just some days like today where I just miss him a little extra. I am very fortunate that I had him in my life, and it’s the thought of him that keeps me going every day to excel in everything that I do. To the ones who’ve also lost someone, please know that it gets easier with time. You can either spend your days grieving about your loss, or you can use it as an opportunity to grow with the thought, “They would be so proud of me if they were here.” 

The last thing that your loved one would want would be to see you steering off your path. During the time period that my dad was battling cancer, he had difficulty eating, walking, and just doing ordinary things every day, but he kept insisting on doing things himself because he didn’t want my family to worry about him nor hinder our studies. I told myself, “If my dad could go through all of that and endure so much pain and sadness by himself, then I can get an A in my class and get a promotion at work.”

I understand that it probably makes sense financially for them to roast their own coffee which they can also sell in bags, but from my experience it's actually led me to spend less money at those places because the quality isn't the same. I make it more often at home now, ordering beans online

I love those two specialty coffee places, and I try to support them by still occasionally buying a drink or a bag of beans. The coffee is decent and has definitely improved since they made the switch, but I miss the coffees they used to have that were probably roasted by highly experienced roasters

I'm hoping it will continue to improve with time

Edit: I forgot to add that I also had some personal experience with this. Several years ago I worked as a barista at a café during the period when they too switched to roasting their own coffee. But it was a small shop and the owner basically seemed like a passionate hobbyist about roasting rather than a true expert. So the coffee ended up being so that light roasts were dark and the dark roasts were burned

Edit 2: I want to clarify again that I'm still supporting those local places and will continue to do so - especially during the pandemic - because I still love them and want them to succeed even if I sorta miss the coffees they used to have",foods

Coffee,"Thanks guys, I finally understand black coffee.","I’ve always enjoyed coffee, but only if it’s creamy and sweet. I’ve tried black coffee so many times in my life, but it’s always tasted like bitter charred ass diluted with water. Lemme mask that shit with cream and sugar and still get that coffee taste and aroma. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that in my opinion, you’re still enjoying coffee, but I’ve always wanted to enjoy a cup of black coffee and couldn’t understand the appeal.

Thanks to this subreddit, I realized I could improve the taste of coffee by throwing out the Keurig and doing things manually. Still, preground coffee from the grocery store didn’t do anything for me without cream and sugar. I was still getting bitter and unpleasant coffee regardless of my extraction.

I received an order of fresh coffee beans from Archetype two days ago, along with a burr grinder. Brewed it with my Clever Dripper.

Oh my god.

What are these FLAVORS? How can black coffee taste like so many things? I was so skeptical about “flavor notes” thinking that coffee just tastes like coffee, I mean they’re all just burnt beans anyway, right?

Nah. I understand now. And the good part is I’m still a noob and 100% doing this all wrong, so things can get even better as I get the variables right.

The fact that these beans have nothing artificial in them is really blowing my mind.",foods

Coffee,One thing they won't tell you about having Corona: You can't taste your coffee any longer!,"Seriously folks, when I was diagnosed, I thought: ah this is fine, I'll just lounge at home sick, and drink tons of delicious coffee. 

Nope.

My subsequent cups tasted awful. At first I thought it was my water, then my own shoddy brewing, etc. What I didn't consider is that the virus actually completely wiped your sense of smell/taste (not everyone, but many!). Not to mention I could no longer stomach coffee. So, basically any one of our worst nightmares.

So I ended up not drinking coffee for two weeks, and now that I'm recovered, I can start to taste it again. My taste buds still feel slightly unbalanced... like, I'm getting lots of acidity, but missing some of the more complex flavors. Sweetness is there, but it feels like I'm tasting it at the end of a long tunnel. No aroma so far, so I know I'm missing out on these bags, and it's kind of a tease, but I'm still happy to taste something. 

There's no point to this post other than sharing one of the more irritating aspects of having this thing. I'll say this: now that I've returned to brewing, I'm not overthinking it as much. Manual brewing was stressing me out completely prior to all of this, and I was so dissatisfied with my brew. Now? After not having the benefit of coffee for two weeks I'm only focusing on the positives.

Is my cup lacking sweetness? Yes. But I'm really enjoying the more acidic aspects of the coffee. Am I missing that candied orange? Yup, but I'm getting some really nice Bergamot, and tropical notes. It also doesn't hurt that the coffee is from Black and White, and they are just awesome in general.

Anyway, stay safe out there folks. Enjoy whatever it is you are brewing!",foods

I had used an orange slice in place of a filter before and it worked ok. So I thought that if I poke a few holes in the Oreo like I did the orange slice, it would work the same. I was right! I brewed it the same way, using my usual recipe. The Oreo center added a nice creamy texture to the coffee that was complimented by the chocolate in the cookie. The only drawback was that there were either grounds or bits of Oreo floating in my coffee.

Coffee,Coffee is one of the rare things in my life I can control and count on," So much stuff happens every single day, and I often feel like I'm totally out of control. My plans change in a matter of minutes. There are days when I have so much to do that I don't even want to get out of bed. And yes, there is this whole global pandemic thing.

The thing that has helped me immensely is, you guessed it, coffee. I make and drink coffee 2 times a day. These two points in my day are kind of my **anchors**; these points in time are fixed and I can always count on them happening. I enjoy the ritual of making a good cup. I put the kettle on. While the water is heating, I measure the beans. I like the sound of coffee beans make when I pour them into the lid in which I weigh them. I grind the beans, and the ground coffee starts to smell wonderfully. I then either make an Aeropress if I'm lazy or a pourover (v60/Kalita). I adore the sound of coffee dripping into the cup, and I'm completely in love with the look of the coffee surface in my Kalita when I pour water after the bloom, both the colour and the texture. When all is done, I finally sit and enjoy my cuppa.

Yes, this all may sound super corny, but I really feel this way, and I'm sure someone else will be able to relate. It's kind of a feast for all the senses; it's a simple ritual that grounds you (no pun intended) and returns you to the present moment, a meditation of sorts.

For these reasons I don't mind paying a bit more for some good coffee beans and equipment; I realized that this means so much to me every day, and I think it's worth every penny.

To finish this small essay/rambling, I want to thank this community (r/coffee) for being very supportive and helpful. I have asked a million questions here and always got great answers. I hope we will attract more and more people to the world of third wave coffee, because it is truly something else.

Please help?,"As the title suggests, I (19f) am an Ex-Mormon who moved out of my Mormon household two years ago and have discovered I have a deep and startling adoration for coffee! Mormons aren't allowed to drink coffee or tea (or alcohol or overly caffeinated beverages like energy drinks, etc) so those types of things were never in the house growing up. In early high school I figured out how to hide my bank statements from my parents when I bought from Starbucks, but now that I'm paying my own rent and groceries, the daily coffee runs are adding up in my expenses. 

My old roommate had a coffee and espresso maker and she would have a pot brewed every morning for us both, but I moved out a few months ago and I'm starting to realize I'll need a machine of my own if I want to have my fill without constantly breaking the bank. Unfortunately, I am totally lost and don't know where to start. I'm looking for some answers to my VERY STUPID questions and thought this subreddit might be a good place to ask? I know it's a lot and I'm very sorry, please let me know if this isn't the right place to ask or if I need to flair this with something. Thanks!

&#x200B;

1. How do I make instant coffee? I bought a package of instant coffee packets a little while ago but whenever I try to look up instructions I get really confusing answers about how to diy create instant coffee powder, or sarcastic answers like 'put instant coffee in water. drink. it's so simple even a baby could figure it out.' ........ well... I still need help. Is it imperative that I use a kettle to heat up the water, or could I use a microwave? I saw something say you can use hot milk instead of water, but is that only for certain types of instant coffee? I like my coffee black, so I don't want to buy the kind that needs milk instead of water. I don't need to put it in a filter, right? Am I supposed to let it steep for a few minutes like tea and fish out the grounds from the bottom of the cup when I'm done?
2. What's an affordable, user-friendly, durable coffee maker that I could buy? I want something that will last, and doesn't require any extra machinery for espresso or French squeeze stuff because if I don't even know how to make instant coffee I doubt I'll start jumping into the complex stuff anytime soon... I just want to be able to make myself a regular pot of black coffee in the mornings... 
3. What type of coffee filter is specifically made for 'normal' machines? I tried buying my old roommate some coffee grounds once to pay her back for drinking her coffee every morning but she laughed and said I bought the wrong kind for her machine because they came in little cups with filters on the bottom, and hers just took regular grounds and filters. I do not know what a regular ground or filter is supposed to look like.
4. How will I know what shape of coffee to buy for a regular machine? I know my roommate's coffee powder stuff was all ground up, and I know that in Starbucks they had these big machines with whole coffee beans loaded on top. I'm assuming instant coffee means that it doesn't need a machine to brew, but it looks basically the same as my old roommate's coffee powder grounds???? Am I supposed to buy the whole beans and crunch them up in a blender or something before transporting them to a different container?
5. What is the DANGEROUS amount of coffee to consume in one day? I hear comments and jokes in TV all the time saying 'you look like you've drank twelve cups of coffee!' or 'dude, isn't that like your third cup in an hour?' and I can't tell if they're supposed to be grossly hyperbolic or if some people legitimately drink that much coffee. Personally, I usually don't go above three or four in a day, but is that still way too much? For reference, I am 5'2"" and 102lbs. Would it be better if I added creamer or something to make it less... potent?
6. How the cuss does grocery store coffee creamer taste so cussing disgusting?!!?! I bought a giant jug of the stuff a while ago and it tasted like straight gasoline the second it touched my tongue. Am I doing something wrong???? I like super sweet sugary creamy Starbucks coffees but when I drink it myself I prefer it plain black. I'm fine drinking it black but I'd like to be able to add something in when I've got a coffee sweet tooth. Is there a certain amount of creamer you're supposed to never go above when adding it in?
7. Along the lines of the question above, what does it mean when someone asks 'cream or sugar?' or 'do you want room?' I went to a cafe once and when they asked me that I just gave them the blankest look and said 'uhh... sweet. Can you make it sweet?' and the server said 'sure, how many?' and again, I was bewildered. Is a cream and a sugar measured in... tablespoons? grams? ounces? The waiter just said 'if you want it super sweet I'll just add five of each,' and when they brought it back it was indeed super sweet, like creamer gasoline sweet. Now I know five creams and sugars each is too much, but I still don't know what 'room' is or how to use one. 

If you read this far, thank you endlessly. Once again I'm very sorry if it's annoying, and also if I'm posting this in the wrong place.

Coffee,Do you bring coffee to work for potlucks?,"The company I work for has holiday potluck luncheons and while we had to change things up this year, we did something. 

I decided to bring my coffee gear and be a barista for a day at work. I brought a french press, pour over, and espresso machine. I had an espresso blend for the espresso and a light roast Peruvian grocery store coffee for the other two. I also brought some home made Mocha, Peppermint, and Pumpkin spice syrups. 

I only got into making specialty coffee this year and some of my co-workers have already tried samples of the coffee I bring and make (on breaks of course), and when I saw the Desert luncheon coming up I knew what I wanted to do.

It was a great way to get practice with the machine and develop my workflow, and I had fun pulling back to back shots.

The coffee was a huge hit. I made a lot of lattes and mochas. A couple unique requests were an Americano, a straight shot, and pour over.

Coffee,I spent 40 hours on the road rating gas station coffee.,"So I needed to drive quite a ways recently, and I decided to rate gas station coffee while I was at it.

To standardize everything, I got a medium size of the house blend filter coffee, black.

\#The ratings:#

1. \#Buc-ee's# - I am admittedly extremely biased here. I absolutely love Buc-ee's. If I had to rank my top 5 greatest things in life, the Texan-beaver-themed gas station chain on redneck steroids would be right in between country music and >!blowjobs!<. Their coffee has long-been one of my favorite things about the Buc-ee's. The coffee is consistently fresh, hot, and tasty. 10/10.
2. \#Circle-K# - I stopped at two Circle-K's in both Louisiana and Florida. The thing that sets Circle-K apart is the full-auto coffee machines. Your coffee is ground fresh for every cup, for all of their options. Their house roast is complex, yet smooth. I also tried their ""New Orleans King Cake"" blend, which tasted slightly like a King cake.  The only fault is that their coffee is far too hot. 9/10
3. \#Starbucks# - We'll treat my Pike roast as a baseline that almost everyone has tried. Standard black coffee, a little burnt. However, my damn cup had a hole in the bottom that I didn't notice until it was filling up my cupholder with coffee. I stopped at another Starbucks and they gave me a new one for free. 1/10 for the first Starbucks, and 7/10 for the second, averaging to 4/10.
4. \#Pilot's# - Kinda gross. Very unmemorable. 3/10.
5. \#7-Eleven# Not even slightly warm. Straight-up room temperature. 1/10

I’m at my parents’ place this week and brought my Aeropress to avoid using their pod machine. Pre-ground my beans before I got here.

Now this one will be a little different as I have planned (truth is I haven't actually planned anything) for less text than before and more images, so if your eye's don't like seeing things, cease to use the gift that is sight, I suppose.

Now that the preamble is over, let's get into the deal. What's going on? I thought we finished this last time I hear your imaginary voices say in my head. Well compadres, I guess Part 3 could really be part 4A, or perhaps this could be Part 3B, that's probably more sensible.

So I'm going to admit up-front, I effed up. I mistook the advice given to me by someone who actually knows what they're doing - and later to my wife's dismay, she too said I was wrong (but I don't recall that part...) but we did it anyway. I was ***SUPPOSED*** to soak the cherries in filtered water for at least 24 hours ***BEFORE*** pulping.. You already know what I did wrong don't you.

[My stupidity, laid out bare](https://preview.redd.it/g4u5anvih8p51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a6ce9e116cf02882cd749999fd070ba65bd7d94)

Yep, I pulped the god-damned cherries AND THEN SOAKED THEM IN WATER FOR 24 HOURS WITH THE CHERRY SKINS. You should've seen the look on Danny's face. It's like someone who's been thinking about that last slice of pizza in the fridge ALL DAMNED DAY, they come home. Open the fridge, 'OMG THE BOX IS STILL THERE' they whisper. The excitement is electric. They smell it. That cheese. The crust. That sumptuous pineapple (had to do it). Cold pizza - food of the gods. Their hands tingle in anticipation.

And then they grab the box AND ITS EFFING EMPTY. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, fleeting but all very real. First, the sheer rawness of utter loss. Then the explosion of anger as they hit betrayal at full -send-it' speed. Then despair. WHAT'S THE POINT OF CONTINUING WITH THE DAY NOW?

Yeah, so anyway, that was what happened. We ended up with 370 odd grams of green coffee. Here's the two harvests and I'll let you guess which is which! (The joke is, I've got no freaking idea).

&#x200B;

[The greenest green that ever did green](https://preview.redd.it/nc2hmkpvh8p51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f69db3fb6d5b225fb31397018e9c2eb4ce27e51d)

One lot I roasted in Part 3. I actually roasted 4 lots of that harvest. Two 100g roasts and two larger lots. The last lot I roasted I had vac-sealed and stuck in the freezer for a reason. To store it obviously, but storing it for a change.

Midyear this year, I changed setups to my dream-team. The Breville Dual Boiler was pensioned off for a Lelit Bianca. I wanted some extra control for the second batch to see what else I could do with our coffee. This was completely foolish as it was also a different (the last) roast, thus could've been the best on my previous machine with my workflow at that time - BUT WE'LL NEVER KNOW!

The coffee was surprisingly GOOD. Dark fruit, like stewed plum. Sweet and not very bitter. I was keen, very keen for a roast on the second batch, not only because of my brain-dead processing that was not anaerobic fermentation (Although all fermentation is anaerobic when you think about it), but because of it being roasted in an actual roaster (Soz-but-not-soz Behmor). So let's get into it.

It was a Monday like any other.. actually it was only last Monday, the 14th. I had finally arranged a day off and to meet Danny at his work-place on the southside of Brisbane. I rode over with the coffee having being rested about 3 months, vac sealed and slapped in a backpack.

First up Danny had a visual inspection of our meager coffee and wasn't too surprised at what he saw. His keen eye, wealth of experience (Also currently working for 3Brothers coffee, a green bean importer/distributor in Australia means he sort of has plenty of data/other coffee around him constantly) as well as recent (almost constant) experiments he's running with some local coffee meant he knew what was coming. I also recommend following him on Instagram if you wish to learn more about what he's doing - it's very interesting!

A sample lot was roasted on an Ikawa pro to be later cupped against other local Brisbane coffees by Danny (You can see ours at the end here). As an aside, the roast for cupping was interesting to review. The beans themselves were quite dark, with not a lot of silverskin being released from the outside of the bean or in the middle, and not a lot of expansion at/after first crack.

[Samples for cupping](https://preview.redd.it/sq1jngirh8p51.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=437b954381bb77c735cd83fb7957a6e81aa37dcf)

The roast on the Proaster roaster, (""TH CR-01J"" for anyone that's interested) was different. The beans expanded. A lot more silverskin was lost and colour was no where near 'almost black.

[BOMBS AWAY](https://preview.redd.it/fxxwe70ii8p51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0736826d2d2aff35125842b4cebadae1aaf798ce)

Here you can see Danny dropping the green in to the roasters hopper. I was keen to get this party started. As it is with roasting, the turning point isn't terribly exciting. There's about 5 minutes of monitoring and that's about it.

[Yellowing phase](https://preview.redd.it/vzwftnn0j8p51.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec0a39f9217f85304ad4b65f37aa8624a67347c5)

Here's the good stuff. The Maillard reaction. This is what makes cooking butter and garlic so good. Or frying onions. Also, side-note, using a roaster with a tryer is all I ever imagined it to be. If I ever get right back into roasting, I am seriously aiming for a roaster that has a tryer.

The roasting smell was that like any other. The typical almost damp, grassy smell of the drying phase, through to 'bread' or the sweetness. Then first crack and that glorious freshly roasted coffee small (Which I suppose is mostly CO2 being released amongst other things).

[THE DROP](https://preview.redd.it/jh8ls5faj8p51.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0736b8f39621cd433117e43ebed7d8118b7b805)

And just like that it was done. A decent roast, but with Cropster having issues (I was also helping Danny sort that out as he hadn't hooked his current laptop up to this roaster, so it was good being able to see that for the first time in use), we don't have any graphs to show off.

[For some reason I LOVE the cooling trays\/bin\/whatever on roasters](https://preview.redd.it/a695yy0tj8p51.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff06bf08809317323c82d83ed83ea5f46b82bfcc)

And that was that. Now I'd stolen a large portion of Dannys day (He was kind enough to let me run my own roast on the Proaster with coffee he donated, too), I was off packing. 2 bags of \~100g was now on my back and I transited off home.

[The home lab. 3 Grinders is enough, right? Also, the coffee trees are just outside this window. To the right.](https://preview.redd.it/kb63o6w5k8p51.jpg?width=4784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf54b4d8b55924de8ffb260308d49379ae099cca)

One bag was sealed immediately as I returned home and stored like Demolition Man in my freezer. The second was rested until this very morning. I had another annual leave day to go see a man about a thing, but that man's family apparently was unwell thus our appointment was called off (COVID fears. The wife\\coffee farmer thinks he forgot, it's a very compelling and convenient excuse these days). This change was not disappointing, in fact it was quite the opposite.

I now had a whole day to drink me some coffee. My coffee. Our coffee...

Geez it's windy at the moment.

So anyway, here's a little visual guide through the first pull, of the second harvest.

As you can see, these are much more like standard coffee seeds. I would go as far as saying, if you didn't know any better, you wouldn't guess these were only grown 9 meters above sea level. About 3-5 meters from where this picture is taken.

The first (and only so far) shot I've pulled was purged with a little coffee before hand but I didn't move the grinder. The first shot is the dial-in shot, but I feel like me, many people who make coffee at home hate to waste coffee so they drink their way through the dial-in shots.

[It's go time](https://preview.redd.it/e9n2p62hl8p51.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=354b623c3fead01c8bfe32daa0ff6a7298c7c4c8)

And there we are. *Almost* the first drip, but I sold my macro lens to feed my kids (I don't have any kids) so this is as close as I could get.

I'm yet to calibrate or document the flow rate of the group head at certain paddle positions, but I've been playing and taking guestimates when flushing the group head and so forth. Currently I am doing a pre-infusion of sorts. This shot got max flow rate for 3 seconds, 5 seconds of zero flow and then 'paddle half way' for the shot.

Apologies for the short depth of field, but also not really, this isn't about latte art Derick.

Tasting notes. Sadly there wasn't much in it. The latte tasted mostly of milk and my espresso (Whilst a single) had some quite intense sweetness, that made me think of those soft Japanese style chews that are packed like gum. Something white/light-coloured like lychee or rock melon.

For me, this journey has been about having a hobby, that stayed as a hobby, which retained it's (emotional) purity. For me and the certain hobbies I've had in my life, somehow I've always found a way to spoil them, whether it be trying to turn it into an employment opportunity or even perhaps just being too intense with the passion. They've always burned out leaving a feeling of disappointment.

Coffee has been a big part of my life for the last few years. Sometimes it's simply been a way to just get through the day. Start with that morning brew. Then it's 'just wait until morning tea time', then it's 'afternoon tea brew time' and repeat (really sounds like crack now doesn't it). Other times it's been everything a hobby should be. Education, excitement, frustration but overcoming the obstacle or issue and regaining some self-esteem, socialising, finding friends and all that good stuff.

But ultimately, it's all about this weird thing called coffee... I mean it's a freaking seed...",foods

Coffee,A “Thank You” to Coffee.,"I’m currently undergoing chemo and have been struggling with anxiety throughout the whole process, but I especially struggle during treatments. The smell when I walk into the building, the smell of disinfectant, the sound of the IVs beeping, and that awful sensation of my IV being flushed with saline, all bring with them a pang of anxiety. *Here I am, again.* It makes me physically cringe just thinking about it. I’ve tried a number of things to help reduce the anxiety during treatment—watching cartoons, listening to calming music, bringing my favorite foods, but nothing has really worked.

Then I got a V60 and a Carter Travel Mug for Christmas. 

The only thing that I’ve found that significantly calms the deepest parts of me is unscrewing that lid and taking in that beautiful, delicious aroma of Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. I don’t even need to take a sip—the smell enough. 

So from the bottom of my heart; thank you, coffee,",foods
Coffee,Experiment gone terribly wrong,"So I was getting day drunk today, so drunk that I was starting to feel sleepy. Naturally, I decided to make coffee. Great Honduran pacamara.

I did.

The result is the nastiest drink I've ever tasted. It literally has the worst elements of the coffee taste AND the worst elements of the whiskey taste. It tastes like 90s office chair juice. Buttcrack cigarette carpets flavour.

Coffee,"Screw this whole ""need coffee to make coffee"" thing","This morning I got up, excited to for my first cup of coffee (a beautiful Ethiopian Yirgacheffe I roasted three days ago). I weighed out my coffee, boiled my water, ground the coffee, and then knocked my grinder over spilling my coffee grounds on the carpet. Goddammit.

No worries though I guess, it happens. I reweighed my coffee, brought my water back up to temp, and ground my coffee making sure not to knock it over this time. I rinsed my filter, put my grounds in my V60, bloomed the grounds, and as I was pouring I bumped the reset button on my timer. SHIT! Well I knew roughly where it had been when I bumped it, so I'd restart it and hope for the best.

I restarted the timer, and continued my brew. Then the batteries in my scale die, and at this point I'm absolutely losing my mind. I pour what I think is probably the right amount of water through the V60, finish my brew, give it a little swirl in the cup, and taste it.

It's absolutely delicious. It the perfect cup. I've made the God cup. And I will never make the damned thing again, because I know pretty much NONE of the variables. Water weight? Who knows? Brew time? Don't know that either. Literally the only thing I know is the amount of grinds, and even that is useless because I don't know how much water went through them.

Coffee,My new coffee ritual which has finally helped me to enjoy this wonderful beverage.,"This is gonna be a bit long, but I think it's a good story, so I'll tell it.  If you're not into storytelling I'll put a TLDR at the bottom.

My mom (47F) has always loved her coffee.  While she doesn't get super fancy with it, she does do her own blend of grounds (partially cheap ones from the store, with some fancier ones in there to add a hint of that different flavor) which she's spent years modifying to fit her tastes. 

She and I (17M) both happen to have an auto-immune condition that causes something called Raynaud's Phenomenon.  Essentially, when our bodies get just slightly colder, they way overreact and go into that ""sacrifice the fingers to save the internal organs and prevent hypothermia"" mode, which drastically slows circulation through our fingers and toes, causing them to get extremely cold.  Putting on gloves doesn't help that much because they just hold the body heat in, and once the attack has started there's not really any body heat there to hold.  Once you've lived with it for a while you learn how to control it, but it's still pretty annoying, especially during winter.

Anyway, my mom likes to drink her warm coffee in the morning to help warm up.  Until this week I have never been a coffee drinker (I've had maybe 4 cups of coffee prior to this, none of which I finished).  I drink a lot of water, and when I drink water, I like it COLD.  Not what you want in the morning when your main concern is warming up.  So, I've wanted to start drinking coffee for a while but always found the taste of coffee from your typical drip coffee thingamabob to be too bitter.  I did some googles and found a post on this sub asking about this, and somebody commented to try using a French press. This caught my interest, because my mom has one! She likes the taste of it better, but uses her drip machine because it will make her a pot on time, every time ready for her in the morning.  She doesn't like having to deal with the grounds from the French press either.

On Monday, I brewed some coffee with it and liked it much better than anything I had tried before. Since the press makes about 2 cups' worth, I poured a mug for my mom as well. She mentioned how nice it was to have a mug of the nicer tasting coffee.  Later that afternoon I had an idea.

She gets up at around 6:45 every morning, so for the past few days I've gotten up early to brew us a pot of French press coffee to share. I know how much cream she likes, so I put that into one of her favorite mugs and pour hers In addition to my own (I have mine with a little cream and a little sugar, though I've been experimenting to find other combinations I like).  My sisters and I are responsible for the dishes from breakfast, so I take care of washing it and putting the grounds in the compost after we eat.  It's been a fun way to connect with her.

If you're still here, thanks for reading the whole thing :-)

TLDR: My Mom likes French press coffee but doesn't like having to brew it herself or clean the equipment, I don't like drip machine coffee but don't mind brewing it myself or cleaning everything.  I've been making morning coffee for the both of us for the past few days.",foods
Coffee,How does this sub not have a bean of the month club?,"Seems like could be a fun idea for people to be able to order the same bag of beans and share tasting notes and opinions on it.

Coffee,Quitting,"I should preface this by saying it won't be popular, so downvote as you wish. I went deep into coffee for the past five years, tons of reading, best grinders, best beans, home-roasting, visiting plantations, the tradeshows, etc. It's been wonderful and in my memory are some very very special cups. Three months ago I realized I had developed insomnia and what felt like anxiety. What that means is that I started feeling edgy at work, quick to react,and waking every single night at 3:30am for 30 minutes, worrying about whatever situation I have in my life. 

I initially thought that it's just age, I'm 46, and its just part of getting older. I should also note that I exercise and meditate regularly, and they both helped a bit, but didn't put a dent in it. I thought of going to a doctor and looking into anti-anxiety drugs, but I'm not a fan of prescriptions unless absolutely necessary.

Thought came to me that I was up to 3 cups a day, maybe thats it. So, over the past month I've weened myself down to one half/cup in the morning, and plan to let that go next week. The results were surprising. First was that I went through mild withdrawal for two weeks. I haven't had cravings like this since I quit cigarettes. It would pop into a mind and just latch on for a while. That went away. Secondly are the results I hoped for. I feel much more calm, as if everything has slowed down a notch, and I dont react so quick. And, thankfully, Ive been sleeping through the night 90% of the time. It's such a relief. I should say that I have mixed feelings, I really miss some of the bean I used to roast and drink, but this trade-off is feeling like its worth it for me.

Knowing everyone's body is different, I won't offer opinions. I just though sharing my experience might help someone else out there who was running into the same issues.",foods
Coffee,I can't be the only one annoyed by the 10oz bag trend,"Rant

I've been into specialty coffee roasters for about a dozen years, primarily espresso based drinks.  I remember when bags were 16oz.  Then the cost of everything went up, i get that, roasters complained that 16oz of green usually meant about 12oz of roasted, or at least that was the excuse for moving to a 12oz bag, although the price stayed about the same - lets say it used to cost $12 for a bag of 16oz, when the roasters switched it was $12 for 12oz.  Fine, it's still a very, very affordable luxury.  

Now we're at 10oz bags from both micro and mid-level roasters, while the prices continue to climb.  I get inflation, I am not complaining about paying $16-21 for a 12oz bag of coffee, that works out to a buck, maybe $1.25 per double espresso through my machine.  But to keep the pricing there and drop the bag weight to 10oz, come on... Just raise the pricing another $1 and keep the 12oz bag! 

Shipping in flat rate USPS bags costs the same to me, the consumer, regardless if it's 10 or 12oz (or even 16oz!), the cost of the packaging for the roaster is maybe 2 pennies difference, if any for 10 vs 12oz bag.  Honestly I'd rather pay **more** for a 1-pound bag to get only 1 bag in the mail than two 10oz bags.  

This isn't even touching on the impact of throwing more bags in the trash because we're consuming 10oz a day or two sooner than 12oz, therefor over the course of a year, buying more physical bags. 

I'm keenly aware some roasters offer 5lbs, more during the 4 months of quarantine, but I just miss 16oz bags.

^(you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be   able to get me back what I purchased\*\*...)

^(Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from   your side.)

^(you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement   evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I   don't even have any emails on this)

^(Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?)

^(Himanshu: There is no account.)

^(Himanshu: There is no case.)

^(Himanshu: There are no such information.)

^(Himanshu: There are nothing.)

^(you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i   know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to   my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active)

^(you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games   back and get me a new account)

^(Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of   purchase.)

^(Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by   your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still   have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email  \*\* id)

^(you: why can't it be verified)

^(Himanshu: Because all your details were on your   account.)

^(Himanshu: And now there is no account.)

^(Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \*\*  ?)

^(you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i   paid to EA... your billing team will have that)

^(you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this   account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you)

^(Himanshu: I checked your previous case.)

^(Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.)

^(Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your   purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?)

^(Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do)

^(Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.)

^(\*Himanshu: Please share your number. you: my no is +91\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)

^(Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side   within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to   this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?)

^(Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.)

^(Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable   to locate\*\* anything\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \*\*  you.)

^(you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy   anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it   was deleted and would give no evidence of it)

^(Himanshu: So you can receive \*\* a call support\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means   account deletion was requested\*\* from your side.)

^(you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail   from my id that requested it??)

^(you: how can you claim that i requested it)

^(you: that is really lame)

^(Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?)

^(Himanshu: When there is no account\*\* anymore.)

^(Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.)

^(Himanshu: Okay.)

^(you: and my account was deleted by EA so ??????   what are you trying\*\* to suggest????)

^(Himanshu:\*\* We never do that.)

^(you: can't you yourself see that these are all   vague arguments.. just going in circles)

^(Himanshu: Request\*\* was from your side.you\*\*: prove it)

^(you: provide email that came from my id for   deleting this account)

^(you: where is acknowledgement from my end)

^(you: ??)

^(Himanshu: Could you please prove it the deletion request \*\*  was not from your side ?)

^(you: Yes i can... as there is no case ID nor any\*\*  \*\* email that I sent)

^(you: there is nothing related to deletion in my   mail box...)

# Update 1 : EA just deleted my only case ID and now I have nowhere to track the details of my conversation

[https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg)

My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.

[https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr)[/status/1028218856605536257](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr/status/1028218856605536257)

# Update 2:

Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why

# Update 3:

Reddit Mod restored my post.

# Update 4:

I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.

# Update 5:

Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.

# Update 6:

I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.

# Update 7:

I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want.  All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. ""FlyingOfficer"".  I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that ""We cannot assure anything at this moment"".

# Update 8:

Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.

[https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg)

# Update 9:

Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.

# Update 10:

My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.

**LETTER OF THANKS**:

**A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally)** while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield.>>Having said that **I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years.** This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and **my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever**. For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. **I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us.**\>>The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.>>Thanks,>>(Samarjit Roy Choudhury)>>Origin ID: FlyingOfficer>>Thanks to YouTubers, [Drop Rate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRJsZ5d8QdIvaoxCNV9KyLg), [SidAlpha](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779) & [ReviewTechUSA](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReviewTechUSA) for making videos on this issue:>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt_E)

The usual ""we are working on it"" that we have been hearing for 3 years now so I doubt much will change. Full statement -   [https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/official-statement-regarding-hod-gaming-and-game-exploits-r1137/](https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/official-statement-regarding-hod-gaming-and-game-exploits-r1137/) 

&#x200B;

A popular ARK youtuber, H.O.D Gaming, recently made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxxwnyFkuY) exposing some of ARK's glitches that have been in the game for years. Because of the nature of the game (a PvP survival game) these bugs let people destroy other player's thousands of hours of work in just a few minutes.

As a response to this video, the developers of ARK [have globally banned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA) one of their most dedicated content creators.

This is an issue that players have been trying to get fixed for 2 years, that's right TWO YEARS. The only way to get something done about this is go public and put Studio Wildcard under fire.

Just to clear it up, HOD never used these exploits on online servers, the only thing he did is demonstrate them on a singleplayer game.

If you have bought the game consider leaving a negative review if you have been affected by these bugs.

EDIT - Some more videos about this from the ARK community for people who are interested:

pcgaming,The FCC is about to ruin PC gaming for everyone. We need to act now.,"Recently, the FCC announced its proposed rollback of [net neutrality rules.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz4Ej3IVefo) The gaming community has good reasons to consider this move a threat. Gamers are especially vulnerable to ISPs for two reasons:

1. we depend on high quality Internet access.
2. we spend money.

The second one is the biggest reason to worry. ISPs' primary motivation for gutting net neutrality rules to extract more revenue both from *us* (for high quality service that should be standard) *and* the companies we're trying to access. The PC gaming market grew to $36 billion in 2016, with F2P games like League of Legends, World of Tanks, and DOTA 2 [leading the charge](http://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gaming-market-worth-36-billion-in-2016/). 

The New York Attorney General is suing Time Warner Cable right now for [interfering with both Netflix *and* League of Legends players](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14548880/time-warner-lawsuit-new-york-league-of-legends-netflix). Riot provided data on latency and packet loss for the lawsuit, which is pretty damning, [you can read it here](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint.pdf). It wasn't just incompetence on TWC's part. TWC was deliberately allowing failure while they were pressuring Riot Games for a payment.

Another thing to consider is how much data games use. Many modern games are over 50GB in size. Not even counting online gaming, game downloads must count for a sizable chunk of internet traffic. ISPs could charge fast lane fees to companies like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Valve, which would drive up the cost of games and services. In a world without net neutrality, we’ll see shallower discounts, and $70 or $80 games if ISPs get their way.

If we lose net neutrality, whenever you open our wallet online, ISPs will want a piece, and there will be little or nothing you can do about it. But we can stop this. FCC Chair Ajit Pai can ignore the public, But it’s much harder for him to ignore Congress. That’s why the most important thing you can do right now is [email](https://battleforthenet.com) and [call](https://battleforthenet.com/call) your Senators and House reps, and tell them to oppose Ajit Pai's reconfirmation, and [send a comment to the FCC in support of Net Neutrality](https://battleforthenet.com/). 

But perhaps **more than anything** we need a team who can help us organize gamers, and the industry as a whole to fight back. If you can help PM me!

pcgaming,"As a Chinese player, I feel obliged to explain why most hackers are from China","  

Things are clear now, while playing PUBG, Apex or CSGO, if there is only one hacker in the battle, the whole experience will be horrible. And without exception, the majority of hackers are from China.

For the first time I know hacks, I was twelve years old, which is ten years ago. But things are way better than today. I witness the vicious spread of this grey industry chain, and today I want to explain why this happened.

First thing I want to talk about is the choice between vanity and honor. There is a slang in China, “a child from another family”, which represent an ideal kid who is better than you in every way. You will hear the “legend” stories of this kid from your parents, teachers, and relatives. After telling you the story, they always tell you that you should get good grades like him, be talented like him, get as many prizes as he gets. They give you peer pressure by creating a fake kid, but they don’t teach you HOW to be this kid. So, all we know is competing with others, while they don’t care how we win a competition. So if you tell me that I can win a game without effort just by using hacks, yes of course I will use it, the majority of our generation don’t care about the honor of efforts or the way we win, we just care about that we can win.

The second thing is piracy. In China, steam was not widely known until 2015, pirate was our only option if we want to play PC games. Alone with those pirate games, we would also download what we called “modifier(I’m not sure if you guys call it this way)”. Almost all players from our generation experienced PlantsvsZombies with infinite sunlight, call of duty with infinity HP and ammo (Makarov can’t even kill you in “no Russian”). It is fun when we play the single player mod with modifiers, but it is also at this moment, some of us become dependent on software that can “boost” our performance. You might ask that piracy is also an issue in Russia, but why Chinese hackers are much more, this question leads to the third.

I shall call the third reason “excess production capacity”. In the last decade, China experienced the explosive development of the Internet, major in Computer science was such a popular option in university. However, as the bubble burst, many programmers were not hired by mainstream companies. And a huge amount of them was worked for anti-virus software companies and now they are unemployed. You can imagine how easy it could be for them to create a hack by their knowledge. They need to survive, so they choose to degenerate. There are even competitions among those hack studios, I won’t tell you how, but I can assure you that you can purchase a hack of CSGO for a week for only 6 dollars. It is so easy to get and so cheap.

As we can see here, with the abnormal social education, dependence on “boosters” and cheap purchase channels, we are what we are now, the majority of game hackers. Those hackers don’t even know they are ruining the environment, they just want to pursue the pleasure over and over again, kind like drugs, right? Actually sometimes I feel pity for them, some of them even think that steam is the starter of PUBG and origin is the starter of Apex.

Please trust me, every time I see the news that Chinese players are ruining another game, I feel so powerless. I can’t explain to all hackers that how proud you would be if you win a game by your own effort, I can’t explain to you guys what are the reasons that caused this situation. Making hacks is illegal in China now, but we still can’t handle games like Apex which share global servers (because of the vague expressions in law).

And also trust me that many players in China agree with my opinion, we feel shame about using hacks, but we are still minority. All we can do is advocating people around us not to use it. We are changing this situation, but it may cost years to change it for real.

pcgaming,Developers are already starting to decline Epic exclusivity deals because of potential brand damage,"**Fourth Edit and please read this one:** I am seeing other reddit posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/bkvs0h/several_developers_are_refusing_to_be_exclusive/) one blow up and some people seem to straight-up ignore my edits. Just in case it was not completely clear before, [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) **was not contacted by Epic Games for an exclusivity deal.** It was all a misunderstanding, and you can see how the confusion arose by reading the rest of this post and the comments. I am critical of Epic Games just like most of the people on this subreddit, but *please* don't support your criticism what has been proven to be a false claim.

&#x200B;

**Third Edit:** Alright, this is very important. u/arctyczyn, an Epic Games representative has commented here denying that they have contacted [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) at all, let alone offer them an exclusivity deal. u/arctyczyn also stated that they have confirmed this with all of the business development team before making the statement. [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) made a statement [here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/671440/discussions/0/1651043320657573992/?ctp=2) with regards to the whole situation. Instead of paraphrasing his own words, I believe that you should read everything he is saying for yourself. For now I will keep the bulk of the original post unedited so that readers have some context as to the whole confusion, but might change it later on.

**Second Edit:** The makers of Rise of Industry commented here! Make sure to thank  [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) for supporting consumer-friendly practices and to read some of the comments as they shed more light on the Epic exclusives.

**Edit:** We've actually managed to make this one of the top r/all posts! Keep up the good work and r/fuckepic!

Developers are starting to openly express that they have declined or would not accept exclusivity deals for their game.

Apparently Epic tried to snatch Rise of Industry, which is currently on Steam, but the company [declined](https://imgur.com/a/CJO1UsR) the deal because they do not believe in restricting player choice. [This link](https://imgur.com/a/wfyWCR0) provides more context with regards to the exclusivity decision. Keep in mind that this game has been in early access on Steam for a very long time, and for Epic to try to snatch the game under such circumstances is extremely scummy.

Factorio is another game that Epic is very likely to have tried to grab as an exclusive. In their latest [developer blog](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-293), Factorio devs stated that there will be  ''no selling-out to big companies that would use the game as cash grab  while destroying the brand (we actually declined to negotiate  ""investment opportunities"" like this several times already, no matter  what the price would be), the same would be when it would potentially come to any exclusivity deals, which is its own subject... ''

Months ago, CD Projekt Red [publicly stated](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-an-epic-store-exclusive-cd-projekt-red-confirms/) that they are giving any possibility of exclusivity or co-exclusivity for Cyberpunk 2077 a pass on Twitter when asked about their stance.

Chris Avellone who used to work at Obsidian, called the Outer World exclusivity deal a [cash grab](https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-outer-worlds/chris-avellone-epic-games-store). He is currently a writer for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and stated on twitter that while the game will also launch on EGS, it will not be exclusive because of the importance of player choice.

The point of all of this is that the consumer backlash is finally starting to take effect, otherwise developers would not use them declining an exclusivity deal as a source of positive PR that they can share with the public.

Thanks to r/fuckepic for digging out this information.

If any of you happen to know of any other game companies that have declined epic exclusivity deals, message me and I will include them in this post.",gaming

pcgaming,"The Steam Controller was one of the best innovations in gaming and it absolutely failed spectacularly because Valve wouldn't hire one person to sit there and make usable control schemes for the most popular pc games, expecting the community or developers to create those configurations. Incredible.","I first want to state that the Steam Controller is an amazing piece of technology. The customization options available are fantastic, deep, and everything a PC gamer wants in terms of tweak-able controls.

The engineering is impressive and Valve set out to do something different and succeeded wildly.

Gyros, touchpads, the paddles on the inside...so many cool features and yet by and large they are sitting in the clearance bins are your local game stores or gathering dust in your closet as you use your Xbones or PS4 controllers.

How on earth can a company release such a device and not hire a recent college grad, give him $40k to sit there and create good configs for every popular game, and have those default when someone first launches a new title?

The reason no one is using this thing is because PS4 and Xbox controllers just work, right away, every time. And so could the Steam Controller, without much difficulty and it'd easily be the choice of PC Gamers behind KB + M. 

They literally just needed to get an intern and teach him how to configure the various settings and then let him play the most active titles and create decent base templates folks could then take and build off of, customizing as needed.

I am amazed at how you can create something so brilliant and yet botch the adoption to the point where it's now just a novelty item that users pull off the shelf once every six months to give it another whirl, get frustrated and switch back to their old device. 

I mean, release a game in conjunction with the controller's launch that is completely designed to make use of some of the insane technology to show what it could do, with the configurations pre-made and ready to go. Nintendo does this with every new device launch. How on earth did you not consider that?

Those that learned it, loved it. But it was asinine to expect most consumers to spend hours watching youtubers (not even videos made by VALVE itself) explain the various features of the device and what it is capable of. It was asinine to not launch a title that is built to showcase the device's capabilities. It was asinine not to hire someone to publish controls for popular games. And it's unfortunate that the device is fading into obscurity, because it is cool and should've changed things for the better.

**Edit: This post has thousands of upvotes and a ton of conversation. It's obvious that folks care about the controller, and I hope this actually gains some attention from Valve. Sure it started as a rant, but honestly at the end of the day we just want the product to see the glory it truly deserves. Because it is a great controller, and customizing it is really deep (thanks!) Just asking you get the gamer closer to that perfect feeling of the fully configured and usable scheme without requiring hours of tweaking to do so on his part.**

**It's not hard, find someone to be your configuration expert and have them own this. Let that guy make official videos explaining the cool features and how to utilize them. Let him push out Valve endorsed configurations for the most popular games being played at the time. That person exists right now and he's probably in this thread right now.**

**Keep working on the Steam Controller and give us the SC2, because *the controller is awesome* and deserves a sequel. When it's right it's unbelievable but the time it takes to get the feel right is too much for your average users who just want to jump in and enjoy some pcgaming for a few hours.**",gaming

pcgaming,Why I will never use Epic Launcher,"I'm writing this as awareness for all players of EpicGames products. This is pure unaltered facts about the company and its support to its users that everyone should be in the know about. (this is a education piece, not an insult or berating of the company, take it as you will).

&#x200B;

On the 11th of May 2018 my EpicGames account with Fortnite got hacked, and the hacker purchased $205 worth of coins on my account and transferred them out. I found out on the 17th that there was unauthorized purchases on my account. I was able to perform a password reset (hacker did not reset my account security information other then password), logged into my account after a password change and removed my CC from my profile. On the 17th I also sent an email via their support system to EpicGames stating my account was hacked. I explained to them that the purchases were not legit and asked for a refund. (mind you this is the only form of contact EpicGames has) days later, no responses, sent follow up email, again on the 21st stating, almost 3 days later, still no response from EpicGames.

&#x200B;

I advised them in my 2nd email that if I did not receive a response with 3 business days. I was going to dispute the charges with my bank as the window for disputing was closing and I still did not receive any responses... On the 23rd I disputed the charges with my bank and immediately after received an email from EpicGames stating my account was **permanently** suspended and could not be reactivated.

&#x200B;

So now my account is locked and I am unable to play Fortnite (the paid save the world edition, not battle royal). Below are the emails and transactions from my account as proof. You can even go to EpicGames website and attempt to search for contact info. You will find email is the only contact method.

&#x200B;

I strongly advise anyone using EpicGame services to be cautious about continuing to use their services. Their user support is basically non existent. If your account gets hack and you lose money, they will do nothing to assist to resolve the problems. In good conscience, I can not let this go by on the way side without making it known to the public. This is pure criminal actions of a company that deals with currency transactions.

\*EDIT\*

Quick edit to clear up a few things that I see people continually commenting on so lets clear this up so I don't have to repeat myself.:

Firstly, my Epic account was created before 2FA and failed login attempt lock outs were even a thing. I used this to purchase ""Save the world"" edition. This was before Battle Royal was out, and before better security was put into place. Without the above security things like BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS are very common (however it could have also been a leak on Epics end, while there are threads on this subject. I've yet to been able to verify any such leaks). Secondly. I stated ""transferred coins"" out from my account. This was an assumption, and I may have been wrong about what exactly they used the vbucks on. It may have been used to purchase skins and other items to gift them, or vbucks may have been purchased to pad my account before selling it. In either case. The facts are as presented of the issue at hand. Account was hacked and emails shown are via Epic games ticket submission system. There is also an Epic games ticket number as shown in the 2nd email image above.

\*Additional Edits\*

For those asking for receipts of the hackers purchases. See below pictures. (also note the descriptions in another language...)

I would also like to add. Since writing of this post, I have been contacted by two employees at Epic Games (see below), and they have since restored my account, as well as provided me with 5k v-bucks. While I am happy the company is putting effort into fixing this. (it is appreciated). This whole issue could have been completely avoided from the get go, and because so I will not be returning to the platform. The issue here was lack of response from the company through **THEIR OWN** official channels that had to be bypassed and escalated to a public forum for anything to have been done about it. (no ill will towards Epic Games. I just don't see how the root cause of this issue could possible be resolved). However, I do commend them on reaching out, and attempting to make the issue right. They should received some credit for doing so instead of simply ignoring this thread altogether.

------------------------------------------
Recent rumblings tell us that there will soon be crates in the game that let you get random loot.

This in itself is not a bad thing! Being able to spend your match reward money on a random loot box is a cool idea!

The issue comes from the special crates **which require a key to open**. 

Keys cost $2.50 in *real world money*.

[Crates contain one item each.](https://twitter.com/poopiequeen/status/889882216179916801)

[**And yes, that includes the special ones.**](https://twitter.com/poopieQueen/status/889899936107470848)

#[PLAYERUNKOWN HIMSELF HAS STATED THAT IN THE FULL GAME, ALL CRATES WILL COST MONEY. NONE. WILL. BE. FREE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6ph5xf/looks_like_free_cosmetics_are_going_byebye/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=PUBATTLEGROUNDS)

Want a full outfit? Assuming even just 4 pieces (top, bottom, shoes, accessory), that's 10 dollars- **minimum**- for *one single outfit*. But remember: Each crate provides only one item, and you can get duplicates. With each piece you get, your chance of getting a duplicate increases. The chance of getting all items in a 4 item set at the minimum possible price is **.065%**. Less than point 1 percent chance. This system is rigged against you.

Meaning to complete a set, you will spend 10 dollars minimum, but more likely need to spend 15-25 dollars. On one outfit.

Imagine if the game got an update that let you buy a new outfit, for 20 dollars. Would you buy that outfit? Imagine if EA or Ubisoft or Bethesda put up DLC for one of their games- a single in-game outfit for 20 dollars. Would you buy it? Would they get away with it?

So do your part and don't support this obscene money-grab! 

I want that battle royale schoolgirl outfit for my male character but like  hell I'm dropping the cost of the game on keys for this shit! Is it really worth the money of the 20 people stupid enough to overpay for things like this when you could have so much more by being reasonable about it?

**Let me explain why ""it's just cosmetic who cares"" is a stupid argument.**

I'm not complaining from the point of view of someone who thinks I'm at a disadvantage. I don't think people getting these things are getting an advantage. I don't think my gameplay is affected by other people having them, or me not having them. *I think that schoolgirl outfit would look fucking sweet on my character, but that if any major company tried to charge 10 dollars for a single outfit they'd be reamed by the gaming masses, let alone if they charged 10 dollars but the price could randomly inflate to 30+ depending on RNG*. 

It's not an issue of ""being affected"" by it. It's an issue of ""I want this, and the way they're trying to sell it to me is bull"". I know some of you play games like CSGO or whatever and think a system like this is reasonable because you're used to it, but *it's not*. In those games, it's also possible to get items for free. In this game, **it will not be possible to get anything for free.** Every single item is a gambled pre-inflated cost where the price is essentially randomized at checkout. We say no to expensive cosmetic DLC in every other genre, it's time to start saying no in shooters.

A lot people are apparently completely unable to distance yourself from the mindset of ""whether or not another person owns a different shirt than me doesn't change gameplay"" and look at this from a perspective of ""I am the consumer, I want to buy this product, but the fact that it is offered to me in this way is insulting and unfair"". It's not an issue of fairness of *gameplay*. 

>Cosmetics sales are a 100% opt in only painless way to keep funding development and servers.

**FAIR ENOUGH.**

However, you are also in favor of the following?

-Complete removal of any in-game system to earn cosmetics

-All cosmetics requiring paying 2.50 to unlock

-Random accruement of cosmetics meaning individual sets, already exorbitantly priced at 7.50+ per set, will increase in price with bad luck

-No system in place to limit duplicates, forcing the player to fight against RNG and have a pretty poor chance of getting an entire set without any duplicates, automatically inflating prices at random

-Exorbitant base pricing to begin with that any reasonable person would turn their nose up at in any other genre 

I don't have  a problem with cosmetics. I don't have a problem with them costing money. I have a problem with a full outfit costing a minimum of 7.50-10 dollars, the price essentially being randomized at checkout, and multiple layers in place to *ensure* that a majority of players get the same pieces over and over forcing them to spend more.

Hopefully that contextualizes this better. Since posting this, Ubisoft has revised their comment and it no longer says that they will issue warnings to people who post about achievements, thankfully.

The content of my request was:  ""Too bad because neither of these things would have been difficult to add. Hope they'll reconsider."" (I was talking about Steam Achievements and trading cards). I only made one post.

[https://imgur.com/c0P49kl](https://imgur.com/c0P49kl)

They flagged it as spam and I now have a community warning on my account, which I have never received in nearly two decades on Steam. And I posted this pretty early on, before there was a dominant thread about this topic (now there is, and it has over 4,000 comments on it).

Just found it a bit aggressive tbh. Not going to ruin my day but thought it would warrant some discussion here. Can't really discuss it on Steam anymore as I'm afraid I'll be banned (perhaps intimidation was the goal here?)

I am not a troll. I'm just a person who waited to buy this game on Steam expecting that it would at least use some basic Steam features. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that when PS and Xbox both get achievements, and many of their own previous Steam games used those features. I'm literally one of their customers already. I bought AC Valhalla on Xbox when it came out for full price, and I was willing to buy the Steam version for cross save. I actually do enjoy the game quite a bit.

**Edit 1:** To those who say ""it's just a warning, move on etc."" Personally I think it says more than that. It says Ubisoft are more interested in investing their time digging through old posts and issuing warnings instead of investing that time implementing customers' basic feedback or generating some good will, which they could definitely use. Also, why issue a warning? Would be easier to just delete or merge threads unless someone is repeatedly posting. Every forum on Steam has redundancies, but I've never seen devs act on it unless the feedback is hostile or the person is making multiple posts.

pcgaming,Discord wants to censor harmless speech while the hate speech of Staff is seemingly condoned.,"#SUMMARY

Discord is asking Partners to [sanitize our servers of speech not fit for ""everyone.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/b4dm62/discord_asking_partners_to_sanitize_servers_of/) This policy extends to the ""r-word"" (even in the context of a self-depreciating joke) and the ""n-word with an a"" (even in the context of posting song lyrics on hip-hop servers). Although many Partners, including those with predominantly African American communities, [have continued to voice concern about this policy](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/official.png), Discord has not addressed those concerns directly or stated that it has any intention of changing the policy.

&nbsp;

A representative of Discord Trust & Safety was [notified directly](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/mayordm.png) on March 23rd that one of the Discord Staff outlining this policy to Partners has [pages of hateful and disparaging Tweets using #FuckCisPeople, #CisPeople, and #Cis](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweethistory.png) on the public-facing Twitter account linked in her Discord profile. The Tweets were discussed on the Discord server for Partners on [March 24th](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/sundaytweets.png) and [March 27th](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/hatespeech.png). The Staff temporarily made this Twitter account private on March 28th, but it was made public again on March 29th with none of the controversial Tweets removed. The Staff in question is still regularly and consistently communicating with Partners in an official capacity using a Staff account linking said public Twitter account.

&nbsp;

Partners are expected to abide by the CoC's strict speech guidelines across all of our social media because our [""behavior may reflect on Discord.""](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/partnercoc.png) Discord gives Partners 48 hours to remove reported content because [Trust & Safety adheres to the same deadline](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/trustsafety.png). 113 hours passed between Trust & Safety being notified about the #FuckCisPeople Tweets on March 23rd and the Twitter profile temporarily being made private on March 28th. Now that it is public again, it has been 160 hours, and none of the Tweets have been removed.

&nbsp;
 
 Although I suspect I will be de-Partnered for submitting this post to /r/pcgaming, it is only a matter of time before someone else does the same in a less reputable sub, and I believe that Discord -- not the individuals it employs -- should be taken to task over this latest example of a disturbing double standard in its core values and ethics. Not only has Discord failed to respond to Partner concerns adequately, but it has failed to moderate even its own staff accordingly under its own guidelines. This raises serious concerns for Discord communities about what standard our speech will be evaluated under, and by whom.
 
 &nbsp;

#BACKGROUND

Last week I posted a thread on [/r/DiscordApp](http://np.reddit.com/r/DiscordApp) about CoC changes for Partners, which is [now locked](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/b4dm62/discord_asking_partners_to_sanitize_servers_of/ejhkztn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Discord never responded to the thread and the only direct acknowledgment I've seen about the concerns raised in it is [denial that we are being asked to ""blanket ban"" certain words](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/denial.png). This denial is given in the absence of any statement adding, retracting, clarifying, or expounding upon past Staff statements to the contrary.

[(Discord Partner CoC)](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024871991-Discord-Partnership-Code-of-Conduct)

&nbsp;

On March 23rd, [/r/JoeRogan](http://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan) DMed a representative of Discord Trust & Safety (hereinafter referred to as ""Safety Boss"") [notifying him](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/mayordm.png) that the public-facing Twitter account linked on the Discord profile of another Staff member (hereinafter referred to as ""Help Boss"") contained a [prolific history](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweethistory.png) of disparaging Tweets using the hashtags ""#FuckCisPeople"", ""#CisPeople"", and ""#Cis"" between 2014-2018. [Here are some examples of those Tweets](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweet-mini.png). Help Boss was one of the Discord Staff appointed to answer Partner questions about the new CoC and [many of the quotes in my CoC thread](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/highlighted.png) came from her. [/r/JoeRogan](http://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan) provided direct links and screenshots of these public Tweets to Safety Boss.

 &nbsp;

Safety Boss acknowledged his concern:

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss:** ""I'll pass the feedback/info along."" (March 23rd)

&nbsp;

One full day later, when it was seen that the Tweets were still public and the Twitter account was [still linked](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/profile.png) in Help Boss' profile, [/r/JoeRogan](http://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan) vocalized his frustration at the perceived double-standard by [linking to one of the #FuckCisPeople Tweets](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/sundaytweets.png) in #Ask-The-Team. Discord Partners condemned the Tweets for their contents. No members of Discord Staff did the same.

&nbsp;

Later in the day, Safety Boss acknowledged these concerns:

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss:** ""[...] We definitely care about the feedback and take it to heart. [...] I keep up with this channel! [...] I'll be sure to share that feedback with the team as a whole."" (March 24th)

&nbsp;

Four days later, when it was seen that the Tweets were *still* public and the Twitter account was *still* [linked on Help Boss' profile](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/profile.png), [/r/JoeRogan](http://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan) *once again* asked in #Ask-The-Team to [address what had by now become a flagrant and egregious example of Discord's double standards](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/hatespeech.png).

&nbsp;

> **/r/JoeRogan**: ""Can we address why a Staff member is using hate speech publicly, calling for violence? Or is that swept under the rug like the rest of it? [Help Boss] still [has] publicly available Tweets connected to their work Discord account. Using Discord's platform as a starting point, I can click on [Help Boss]'s profile, see her connections, click on her Twitter, and find hate speech. Explain how that is not relevant?""
>> **Help Boss**: ""*I fucking hate cis straight religious people and I seriously hope the fucker responsible drowns.""* (Mar 26, 2016)

&nbsp;

> **Discord Partner**: ""As a white straight religious cis person, that makes me super duper uncomfortable. ??""

&nbsp;

#DISCORD DOESN'T CARE HOW PARTNERS FEEL ABOUT STAFF HATE SPEECH

One Discord Partner said that as a religious person, the views expressed in the Tweets [made her feel very uncomfortable](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/hatespeech-mini.png). I spoke with this Partner, who is a Muslim, on March 29th and believe her reaction was genuine.

&nbsp;

I asked this Partner if any member of Discord Staff reached out to her in the days since the Tweets were shared to condemn their contents, renounce them as being representative of Discord's values, or to make her feel more comfortable coming to Staff for help. [She said no](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/uncomfortable.png).

&nbsp;

There are many Staff roles on the server for Discord Partners and every Partner I've spoken with has only a vague idea of what any of them signify (there is no description on the server or website). Out of these Staff roles, I counted the following Staff online throughout the day after Help Boss's public Tweets were posted and discussed.

&nbsp;

x1 Discord Staff with the ""Hype Floof"" role
&nbsp;

x1 Discord Staff with the ""Hype Knight"" role
&nbsp;

x1 Discord Staff with the ""Safety Boss"" role
&nbsp;

x8 Discord Staff with the ""Help Boss"" role
&nbsp;

x18 Discord Staff with the ""Discord Devs"" role

&nbsp;

Out of these 29 online Discord Staff, not one condemned the views expressed in the Tweets. Not one renounced those views as being representative of Discord, its values, or those of its Staff and employees. Not even Help Boss disavowed these views as being reflective of currently-held beliefs or values.

&nbsp;

In fact, rather than address these concerns and commit to removing the Tweets or privatizing her account, Help Boss instead asked Partners to take their opinions ""about posts she made 6 years ago"" to another channel.

&nbsp;

> **Help Boss**: ""It would be nice if you could keep this chat to actual questions for Discord staff. You can say whatever you want about posts I made 6 years ago, but please do it in a channel that isn't oriented around getting responses to support issues. [...] So if it belongs anywhere it's in Feedback. [...]""

&nbsp;

The Tweets were from 2016 and the channel this discussion took place in was #Ask-The-Team. There is a separate channel called #Help.

&nbsp;

> **Discord Partner**: ""'Feedback' implies just one way communication. We would like to see a reply, hence 'ask.'""

&nbsp;

> **Help Boss**: ""Technical questions are now appearing in feedback and other channels, because you have effectively decided to hijack this chat to talk about my personal 'hate speech,' and that's not what this server is for. At all.""

&nbsp;

> **Discord Partner**: ""Why are the Tweets still there? [...] Why was no effort made to remove these Tweets?""

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss**: ""This isn't the appropriate place for issues with staff members. If you must, the best place would be abuse@discordapp.com -- you won't get a detailed response but we do read everything sent there.""

&nbsp;

#PARTNERS HAVE 48 HOURS TO REMOVE COMMUNITY CONTENT
#160 HOURS WASN'T ENOUGH TO REMOVE ONE STAFF HYPERLINK TO HATE SPEECH

Many Partners feel the 48 hour deadline for removing reported content on our servers is unreasonable given the scope and controversy of what we are being asked to moderate. Discord is known to issue vague warnings, and Safety Boss acknowledged that while Partners would be ""pointed in the right direction"" of reported content, they [should not expect to be told which users posted it](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/users.png) for ""privacy reasons."" As one Partner described [his own past experience](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/trustsafety.png) with Discord T&S, ""the delay in e-mail responses and [...] overall vagueness [is] hardly helpful."" 

&nbsp;

Dismissing these Partner concerns, ""Hype Queen Supreme"" explained that [Discord's own Trust & Safety timeline is 48 hours](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/trustsafety.png), so Discord ""abide[s] by that rule for all of [its] users.""

&nbsp;

Discord boasts in its ""[35 Reasons to Work at Discord](https://youtu.be/hX9MOVIMYkg?t=119)"" video that it sees performance reviews as ""rigid and ineffective,"" so its employees ""talk to each other on an ongoing basis"" instead. Safety Boss has [stated that most Discord employees work on-site](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/onsite.png).

&nbsp;

Acknowledging these facts, I submit the following timeline of events and ask Discord to provide its Partners and users with an explanation as to why Help Boss was not compelled -- either through her own action or the direction of her employer -- to delete the Tweets, conceal them from view, or remove the Twitter link from her profile in a 160 hour period involving three separate notifications about the content.

&nbsp;

**March 23rd - 160 hours since first notification of concerns.**
&nbsp;

Safety Boss, who is a representative of Discord Trust & Safety, is personally notified that the Twitter account linked on Help Boss' profile has a public and recent history of what should meet Discord's definition of Hate Speech.

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss:** ""I'll pass the feedback/info along."" (March 23rd, 6:25PM PST)

&nbsp;

**March 24th - 146 hours since second notification of concerns.**
&nbsp;

Help Boss' Tweets are brought up in the Discord Partners server and acknowledged by Safety Boss a second time.

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss:** ""Gotcha, I'll be sure to share that feedback with the team as a whole."" (March 24th, 4:55PM PST)

&nbsp;

**March 27th - 41 hours since third notification of concerns.**
&nbsp;

Help Boss' Tweets are brought up a *second time* in the Discord Partners server. Safety Boss is notified a *third time* about the Tweets and Twitter link.

&nbsp;

> **Safety Boss:** ""This isn't the appropriate place for issues with Staff members. If you must, the best place would be abuse@discordapp.com -- you won't get a detailed response but we do read everything sent there. [...]"" (March 27th 10:16AM PST)

&nbsp;

#HOW DOES DISCORD VALUE AND EVALUATE SPEECH?

Discord's Partner CoC states that it ""[wants our Partnered servers to be welcoming to all users](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024871991-Discord-Partnership-Code-of-Conduct)."" If this is the intended goal of the CoC policy's restrictions on speech, I ask Discord to answer the following questions for its users.

&nbsp;

1.) In the interest of being ""welcoming to all users,"" I ask for Discord to explain why it wishes to silence users -- particularly those of African American descent -- from [using the ""n word with an a""](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/nigga.png) in acceptable contexts other leading social media platforms allow; such as the discussion of hip-hop, quoting of song lyrics, or even the greeting of a friend. Would Discord please explain to its users why this speech is unacceptable under the company values that influenced the formation of this policy, while the following speech from ""Help Boss"" is seemingly condoned?

&nbsp;

> **Help Boss:** ""Cis men are a scourge and they need to be stopped"" [(March 16th, 2016)](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweet-scourge.png)

&nbsp;

2.) In the interest of being ""welcoming to all users,"" I ask for Discord to explain why it wishes to silence users -- particularly those who are Twitch Partners, content creators, radio and talkshow hosts -- from [using the ""r-word""](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/r-word.png) in contexts other leading social media platforms allow; such as self-depreciating jokes, [discussion arising from those jokes, or even discussion about the social acceptability of the word in general](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/rickandmorty.png). I ask Discord to explain why it wishes to silence these contexts even in the [creation of content put on other platforms](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/partnercoc.png). Would Discord please explain to its users why this speech is unacceptable under the company values that influenced the formation of this policy, while the following speech from ""Help Boss"" is seemingly condoned?

&nbsp;

> **Help Boss:** ""Hey did you know did you know did you know cis people are fucking garbage"" [(June 7th, 2016)](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweet-garbage.png)

&nbsp;

3.) In the interest of being ""welcoming to all users,"" I ask for Discord to explain how it arrived at a policy so prohibitively restrictive on speech as to disallow the contexts described above, and why it has seen fit to push the burden of enforcing it onto Partners with a ""take it or leave it"" stance that does not appear to value our concerns. Would Discord please explain to its Partners why they should have confidence in how their speech under these guidelines will be evaluated, when it is being done under the same roof where the following speech from ""Help Boss"" is seemingly condoned?

&nbsp;

> **Help Boss:** ""Straight people put their filthy lifestyle front and center in everything that they do and I'm tired of it being shoved in my face."" [(June 8th, 2016)](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/tweet-filthy.png)

&nbsp;

#CONCLUSION

It is common and accepted knowledge that Discord has a legal right to restrict speech on its platform however it sees fit. This does not mean there is no place for feedback from its users on policies that have not yet gone into effect. The new CoC only applies to Partner servers for now, but it does set a precedence and carry profound implications for speech across the platform for every user. If you use Discord and have an opinion on how it is forming and applying the policies discussed in this thread, then I encourage you to share your thoughts here, and I thank you for doing so.",gaming

pcgaming,Here is why Epic Games Launcher is better than Steam by Omni,"1. Tencent owns 40% of Epic games, making them a huge shareholder in the company. Tencent also happens to be the biggest video game company on the planet. In other words, I'm confident that we're perfectly safe giving our information to a launcher that feeds user info to the Chinese government.

2. It is developer and publisher friendly since it gives more of a cut to the devs (Epic's 12% vs Steam's 30% cut). Just ignore the fact that Valve said that it would lower its usual 30 percent take to 25 percent for any game's earnings beyond $10 million (including ""game packages, DLC, in-game sales, and Community Marketplace game fees""). Or the fact that the platform fee reduces further to 20 percent for earnings that surpass $50 million. In other words, it would only be an 8% difference in profit (And Steam would outsell Epic anyway so it would end up as more profit for the devs and publishers). Just ignore all that.

3. Exclusivity is the same as competition, obviously. Letting Metro Exodus sell in multiple stores would be terrible since Epic Games is obviously the superior breed. It would only humiliate everyone else. Steam has been a reliable, well populated, and established distribution platform for too long. Don’t you want to split up that obnoxiously large game library into separate launchers? Just download Epic Games Launcher, and you can play a whole 20+ games! WOW! Plus its got like… 4 exclusives or something. AND F0RTN1T3!@#$

4. Epic Games launcher has amazing benefits to users. 80 million accounts were compromised due to a security “flaw” that allowed hackers to log into accounts without needing a password! This means you get FREE EXPOSURE ONLINE. Get ready to become rich and famous! If you don’t want the free exposure (But why?) just contact customer service. They will get back to you in a measly 5 months or so.

5. Feature-wise, yes, Steam might have some (tiny) advantages. But it’s nothing important really. Epic Games Launcher is only missing a few things like cloud saves, user profiles, user reviews, friend activity, forums, mod distribution, groups, item trading, library sorting, account sharing, streaming to other devices, broadcasting, screenshot capture/sharing, controller support, user-created guides, wish lists, automatic refunds, achievements, anti-cheat support, 3rd party keys, etc. 

Other than that stuff, it’s pretty much Steam but better.

6. You can’t play games offline on Epic Games Launcher! I mean, why would you want to anyway? It’s not like offline games are worth playing anyway unless you’re online. I’m confident Metro Exodus will be vastly more fun when you’re online vs offline.

7. Their refund policy is EXACTLY like Steam. Except it’s not automatic, you have to go on a browser and go to their website, contact customer support, and wait 5 months. Oh, and they can refuse refunds even if you meet the criteria.

Conclusion:
I hope I shed some light on why Epic Games Launcher is a superior, feature-rich, and a totally-not-anti-consumer launcher.

A quick registry edit will make your desktop wallpaper look much, much better (Fix in text).","*Not sure if this belongs here because it's not* technically *gaming related, but seeing as this issue ~~e~~affects any PC gamers on Windows, and many of us may be completely unaware of it, I figured I'd post. If it's not appropriate, mods pls remove*

---

For a long time now I've felt like my PC wallpapers don't look as clean as they should on my desktop; whether I find them online or make them myself. It's a small thing, so I never investigated it much ... Until today.

I was particularly distraught after spending over an hour manually touching up a wallpaper - it looking really great - then it looking like shit again when I set it to my desktop.

Come to find out, *Windows automatically compresses wallpapers to 85% their original size when applied to the desktop*. What the fuck?

Use this quick and easy registry fix to make your PC's desktop look as glorious as it deserves:

#Follow the directions below carefully. DO NOT delete/edit/change any registry values other than making the single addition below.

1. Windows Key + S (or R) -> type ""regedit"" -> press Enter

2. Allow Registry Editor to run as Admin

3. Navigate to ""Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop""

4. Right click ""Desktop"" folder -> ""New"" -> ""DWORD (32-Bit) Value"" (use 32-bit value for BOTH 32 and 64-bit systems)

5. Name new Value name: ""JPEGImportQuality""

6. Set [Value Data to 100 (Decimal)](http://i.imgur.com/dm8EYTa.png)

7. Click ""Okay"" -> [Your new registry value should look like this after you're done](http://i.imgur.com/ymXzmcG.png).

8. Close the Registry Editor. Restart your computer and reapply your wallpaper

---

**Edit**: Changed #6 and #7 for clarity, thank you /u/ftgyubhnjkl and /u/themetroranger for pointing this out. My attempt at making this fix as clear as possible did a bit of the opposite. [The registry value should look like this when you are done, after clicking ""Okay""](http://i.imgur.com/ymXzmcG.png). Anyone who followed my original instructions and possibly set it to a higher value **the result is the exact same as my fix applied ""correctly"" because 100 decimal (or 64 hex) is the max value**; if set higher Windows defaults the process to 100 decimal (no compression). Anyone saying ""ermuhgerd OP killed my computer b/c he was unclear and I set the value too high"" is full of shit and/or did something way outside of any of my instructions.

Some comments are saying to use PNG instead to avoid compression. [Whether or not this avoids compression (and how Windows handles wallpapers) is dependent on a variety of factors as explained in this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/6kry64/protip_windows_automatically_compresses_wallpaper/djod0ke/) by /u/TheImminentFate and /u/Hambeggar. 

**Edit 2**: There are also ways to do this by running automated scripts that make this registry edit for you, some of which are posted in the comments or other places online. I don't suggest using these as they can be malicious or make other changes unknown to you if they aren't verified.

**Edit 3**: Thanks for the gold!",gaming

I am not going to buy from Epic. It's not even the missing features and early stage of development. I'm willing to buy from Uplay if I get a better deal on a Ubisoft game or I am willing to install origin for Apex and the times I want to play Battlefield. I don't particularly like those platforms but I'm ***fine with them***. I will buy games from GOG, because I agree with their stance on DRM. ***I enjoy that***. I feel good supporting that idea. I willingly give up Steams features for that.

Meanwhile I actively dislike Epic. Not their launcher design. But their blatant, direct, almost cynical disregard of me as a consumer. It is almost a joke, like they want to play the villain in this timeline and are actively trying anything to make me dislike them as much as possible:

* Spying on me and my Steam friends
* being 40% owned by the censorship branch of the Chinese government
* Tim Sweeney being an insufferable cunt where the only thing he's better at than lying is being a hypocrite
* and the exclusives which use Steam for advertising and then get taken away
   * (and if your store needs those to be seen as 'competition' maybe overthink the concept of your store???)

&#x200B;

Quite frankly I know this is the popular opinion here, so if this is too much of a repost feel free to delete. But MAN does this shit tilt me.

&#x200B;

I personally would rather ^(1)consider pirating^(1) a game (which I have never done before) than give money to Epic and Tencent. But most likely I'm just not playing any of those games for a very long time. Maybe when they are older and I'm bored and they are on a neatly timed Summer Sale

Games,/r/Games is closed for April Fool’s. Find out why in here!,"#Not April Fool’s. 

This April Fool’s, we decided to take things a little more seriously and shed some light on a growing, pervasive issue that has affected the community of r/Games and gaming communities as a whole. In recent times, it’s come to our attention that what has been intended to be a forum for the potential spread of knowledge and involvement in video games has instead become a battleground of conflicting ideas. Ordinarily, this isn’t an issue; discussion by its very nature is certain to bring argument, but when that argument descends into vitriolic attacks between individuals on a regular basis with no chance at deescalation, that’s when, put simply, something’s got to give.

Though certain memes (such as “gamers rise up”) surrounding gaming are largely viewed as a humorous interpretation of a mindset, at the core of the humor is a set of very serious issues that affect all gaming enthusiasts. By showing disdain or outright rejecting minority and marginalized communities, we become more insular. In this, we lose out on the chance to not only show compassion to these people, but also the chance to grow our own community and diversify the demographics of those involved in it. Whether it’s misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, racism or a host of other discriminatory practices, now is the time to stymie the flow of regressive ideas and prevent them from ever becoming the norm.

At r/Games, our community is becoming increasingly responsible for perpetuating a significant amount of these combative and derogatory schools of thought. We remove those comments, we ban the perpetrators, but the issue still persists at a fundamental level: the notion that it’s okay or acceptable to ridicule and demonize traditionally disenfranchised and marginalized members in the gaming community. This is not just an issue in r/Games or on Reddit alone; this is an issue deeply embedded in the ranging depths of the internet, frequently in communities that center around the discussion of games.

##What We See

Unfortunately, this inflammatory content is not an infrequent occurrence. The condescending, dismissive, vindictive and pessimistic attitudes we see in our day to day activity is troubling, especially when those interactions involve harassing or outright targeting regularly discriminated communities. It’s not uncommon for us to see the real issues surrounding these communities be trivialized, derided out of ignorance, or worse, for the sake of entertainment.

To that end, we want to show you, the community, what we mean by “what we see”. These are some of the more awful comments we see regarding [transphobia](https://i.imgur.com/HPS9DKW.png), [homophobia](https://i.imgur.com/S1FGkbd.jpg), [islamophobia](https://i.imgur.com/YNxb69G.jpg), [racism](https://i.imgur.com/MdIZgNn.jpg), [misogyny](https://i.imgur.com/TVd4DKx.jpg), [pro-pedophilia/pro-rape](https://i.imgur.com/2l4Rdxk.jpg), and [vitriolic personal attacks against other users](https://i.imgur.com/Q0qrIVJ.jpg). These kinds of comments occur on a daily basis. [We’ve compiled an entire album of examples](https://imgur.com/a/umrdBYF) of the horrible things people say on this subreddit. From bigotry to vitriol, this album merely scratches the surface of the magnitude of the problem.

In the interest of providing examples, we elected to remove the usernames from these comments; instead, our intent is to show the stark reality that we face on a daily basis in the overall effort to provide a welcoming and responsive community. Preventing the cultivation of bigotry means giving it no ground to go to, and as a whole leave only space for those who would respectfully participate. We must closely examine our own communities, in an effort to encourage acceptance and inclusion, to foster a healthy community in which we value empathy and respect. 




##Do Better; Be Better

Despite the strife that’s both within and caused by our community, there are a multitude of opportunities to prove that we can come together and be a more wholesome, accepting community that exists on a single core idea: enjoying and discussing video games together. Though the industry as a whole has suffered a great deal of trials and tribulations, we also are fortunate enough to be at a point in time in which there seem to be a glut of fantastic games, from major AAA titles down to near-anonymous indie projects that come out of nowhere. 

So let’s revel in what’s available to us, and also appreciate the myriad of backgrounds that we as gamers come from. Our differences in experiences comprise the diversity in the content that we consume, and by allowing ourselves to appreciate those differences, we change our perspectives and interpretations; this applies not only in games, but life as a whole.

Let’s not let the good eggs go unnoticed, though: There are plenty of you who, as members of the community, want to take care of one another. Sometimes this means identifying when conversation becomes confrontation, when discussion gets out of hand and turns to name-calling, slurs or other degrading language. To you, we say thank you. You’re what keep us going, you’re who we want to see more of, and you’re everything that is the potential for a strong, open community for those who love and enjoy video games the way we do.

It’s also important to recognize the opportunities not afforded to everyone, as well as the resources available to give them a helping hand. So this April Fool’s, we’re also asking you to take into consideration the idea of helping these organizations out. These folks have made it their mission to represent and benefit those who still face their own challenges, obstacles and prejudices, and any assistance they can get is another step forward for their cause.

Think back to any recent release and they've always done a gameplay overview, but obviously that's not the case with this remaster. 

Add the fact that theres still a review embargo in place, Rockstar knew exactly what they were pitting out. 

Ive played a few hours of San Andreas on GamePass, and good God are there a boat load of glaring issues.

Why is there even an option for fidelity and performance? A game this old should give you the best of both worlds. 

One of the most frustrating is the fact that when it rains, you can't really see what the hells happening on screen, as the streaks of rain look like theyre white, not transparent. 

This is a prime example of a corporation trying to pull a fast one on a loyal fanbase. 

I know this is just the reddit echo chamber but if this dissuades even five people from buying the game, its worth it.

Games,Horse Games Are Trash and I'm Pissed Off,"Let me take 5 minutes out of your day to fill you in on why I'm so fucking pissed.

Like many of you, I started gaming as young as 6 years old. As far as I can recall, my first game ever was Petz Horsez for my bright pink Gameboy Advance SP. As a little girl who was completely new to gaming, this was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. Complete with shitty chiptune music on an 8 second loop and comedically awful sound effects, this game blew my mind despite the fact that it was mind numbingly boring. The seed was planted, this was only the beginning.

Fast forward about 3 years. I've played nearly every horse game in the Petz franchise a hundred times over, primarily on the Wii, DS, and DSI. Of course the stories are pointless, the gameplay is repetitive and obnoxious, but I was still happy. It had horses in it. I branched out to some other titles, most of them liscensed by Nintendo, but nothing was exciting me like it had before. Every horse game was a copy of another horse game, which was a copy of another horse game. This happens to be the same year that I actually touched a real horse. I liked it so much, I decided I wanted to give riding lessons a try. My wonderful parents humored me, and I sat on a horse and walked around with her once a week. Consider me enamored at this point, I wanted to do this for the rest of my life! Unfortunately, that's not how budgets work. Back to the handheld ranch. 

At 9 my expectations were still low, but the fog of childhood wonder was beginning to lift. My horse games were boring, unrealistic, sugarcoated, and obnoxiously catered towards little girls that didn't know a damn thing about the equestrian world! With the newfound glory of the internet at my side, I set out on a mission to find it. The ultimate horse game. Wiimote in hand, I scoured the internet. I read every top ten list, bought every 4 star 2 review horse game off of Amazon, braved my local gamestop for any sign of a halfway decent horse game. After years of trials, I only found one horse game that was tolerable as far as progression, realism, and gameplay are concerned... Gallop & Ride for the Wii.

This was an underwhelming result, but it was something. After playing the game to death, I could say with confidence it was the best game I'd ever played in the genre, but that wasn't a huge achievement. It did some things right. In the game you play as the heir and manager of a sort of dude ranch. Guests come to stay at your inn, ride your horses, and enjoy the scenery. The game introduced some impressive concepts, such as vaccination, strain on your working horses, and a fun points system besides the regular currency. The controls were obnoxious, as every wii horse game demands you hold the Wiimote and nunchuk as if they were reigns, but this beautiful game gave you the option to toggle your riding controls to a basic joystick and A button. Already 10x better. I have reason to believe other competitors in the horse genre thought little girls were too stupid to even navigate to the settings, since no other game had this possibility. Thank you, Gallop & Ride. You didn't suck so much.

Here's why I'm pissed. While Gallop & Ride was one of the most mature equestrian games I've ever played, it's basically a unicorn. As a 19 year old woman who is still shamelessly infatuated with horse games, I cannot find a single game on any console, much less PC, that boasts the same performance. Star Stable? Are you kidding me? Howrse? It doesn't even have gameplay. You know your favorite genre is suffering when the only tolerable way to play it is IN OTHER GENRES. While Horsez did get me started, I thankfully moved on to greener pastures. I discovered Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, all the games I love as an adult. I can say with confidence, Breath of the Wild does horse physics and mannerisms better than any specialized horse game. If you google ""horse games"" some of your top results will consist of Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of the Colossus, and Breath of the Wild... My friends, these are obviously not horse games.

I didn't enter the horse gaming world to make friends. I'm here to make champions, bank, and a helluva reputation. I want to see my horses die, I want to break out of this pocket dimension that every horse game seems to be stuck in and watch my estate age as it would in reality. A serious equestrian gamer doesn't have time for projectile hearts and 5 minute long nose rubs, we want gameplay. Where is the strategic breeding? The real world illnesses and dilemmas, the branching careers, the satisfaction of rising to the occasion and being the best goddamn manager and equestrian you can be? Where is the soul? I truly believe this is a game that hasn't been made yet. I can't say with certainty whether there is or isn't an equestrian game demand. Maybe I'm the only one who gives a shit, and I'm destined to be angry about this for the rest of my life. But, should anybody else share in this passion, there is a serious genre to be fulfilled here. I won't lose hope, and as someone interested in game design, I won't abandon my own ideas for what the ultimate horse game should look like, but for god's sake, give the weird horse girls and guys of the world something to look forward to.

Thank you.

Games,Paid Mods in Steam Workshop,"We're going to remove the payment feature from the Skyrim workshop. For anyone who spent money on a mod, we'll be refunding you the complete amount. We talked to the team at Bethesda and they agree.

We've done this because it's clear we didn't understand exactly what we were doing. We've been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards, and in the past, they've been received well. It's obvious now that this case is different. 
 
To help you understand why we thought this was a good idea, our main goals were to allow mod makers the opportunity to work on their mods full time if they wanted to, and to encourage developers to provide better support to their mod communities. We thought this would result in better mods for everyone, both free & paid. We wanted more great mods becoming great products, like Dota, Counter-strike, DayZ, and Killing Floor, and we wanted that to happen organically for any mod maker who wanted to take a shot at it.

But we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models, and the addition of paid mods to Skyrim's workshop. We understand our own game's communities pretty well, but stepping into an established, years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating. We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly, even though we believe there's a useful feature somewhere here.

Now that you've backed a dump truck of feedback onto our inboxes, we'll be chewing through that, but if you have any further thoughts let us know.

**OP:**

So it's been a week, and it seems like people are realizing that there's a bunch of stuff we were told would be in the game, but isn't. There have been posts and comments here and there talking about it, and giving examples. A few days ago, I decided to dive into the information repository myself, collect as much as I could manage, and put it all in one place. This is mostly a response to the prevailing notion that we hyped ourselves into believing something that wasn't true from the get go. Some definitely have, and we all know the reputation this game's community has gotten. But really, many of us were just going on what we'd been told, and we'd been told a *lot* of things that didn't end up being true.


I broke everything down into categories. Beside each missing feature there's links to the YouTube video it's talked about/shown in, and all links are to the relevant time in the video. **Bolded links lead to information from just four months ago.** Besides that, I've pulled a relevant quote that sums up the subject, and when none was available (usually because it's from a trailer,) I've added a short comment. Beneath the categories is extra info, and a comment trying to put things into the context of the game we have. There is more than all of this, I know, but this is what I could find.
 **All information linked is either from the horse's mouth, or official marketing material.** 

**EDIT:::** Simplified version here, if you don't care about the lesser details or my rambling context-giving down below. From my comment reply to /u/Mr_Dr0ne :

 I got ya, luckily I still have the formatted post. I threw out everything I could find, that was my intention, but my lack of brevity will always be one of my shortcomings. The big momma issues simplified are:

- The loss of planetary physics, which were said to govern many different systems, seemingly in a cascading effect from the top down:
 | [1](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=1m34s) [2](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=7m58s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=3m14s) [4](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=1m40s)

- The retooling of ships to make them all functionally identical, rather than having different classes for different playstyles, essentially homogenizing ship play into a single playstyle: [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=24m2s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=14m38s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=17m45s)

- The reworking of factions from something with broader significance, into the very simplistic system we have now:  [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=9m37s) [2](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=34s)

- Resource distribution following none of the rules that were spoken of, instead resource variety is more shallow than we'd been lead to believe, so distribution was seemingly homogenized regardless of planet-based factors (likely an effect of the loss of planetary physics)[**1**](https://youtu.be/it_9pUYO2AY?t=4m33s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m2s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=2m48s) [**4**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=10m32s)
|| This also had a knock-on effect for trading, which was trivialized by the ease in which most resources could be found: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=56s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=15m57s) [3](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=35m20s), and also crafting, which went from something Sean hoped would be community drive a la Minecraft (likely because there were far more resources originally, a la Minecraft, there's more evidence of this than just the crafting,) to something that could only be done through recipes the game must teach you before you can actually use: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m8s)

Those are the big ones that effect large swaths of the game, and Sean was talking about them all only four months ago.  This is where all the real complexity Sean had spent years talking about was, and all of it was cut from the game, seemingly during the last delay.

**Edit 2::** I'm being told that the butterflies *do* in fact exist, though are rare. Also, that animals *do* attack one another. I'm going to edit in clarifications for both. Guys, I'm having a balls-hard time keeping track of things, and my computer is absolutely crawling. 

###Please, if you have a screenshot of something, or know I'm dead wrong about something, send me a private message with it! I can't keep up, and that would make it much easier for me to amend information in. I can't keep up with the comments, but I'd like to credit people with the corrections!

###Edit 3:: Instances of ""desert planet"" changed to ""sand planet"" to reflect the exact thing I'm referencing. I know there are rocky planets with cacti and the like, but so far nothing like the large sandy dune planets like the one show with the giant snake-worm thing. Again, if someone has a pic, please PM it to me! 

##Edit 4: I'm editing in the basic change to the ship scanner bit I was wrong about. Still hoping someone could send me a screenshot so I can add that too! PM me if you've got one!

**Comments:** 

There ended up being no landing on asteroids. There's no way to destroy freighters or space stations, and ""fleets"" in the game are compried of maybe three or so ships. Freighters also do not move at all, despite their engines always being on. All of these things make the game much more static and lifeless than we were shown. **Edit:: This is indeed in the game. Leaving it here for posterity.** Scanning from orbit isn't possible, and it's been something a lot of people have been talking about. The scan in the clip covers a much larger area than anything we have in the game, as ship scans currently only find one location on one planet for some reason.

**Comments:** 

**Faction affiliations have been completely trivialized from what we were shown, and seem to have been pared down to almost no significance within the last few months.** Sean talked a lot about how you could have a significant standing with factions that would meaningfully effect the game world. This is not the case, the serve nearly no purpose at all from what I can tell. They open up a few options for things like shield and health recharges, neither of which you would *ever* actually need them to do for multiple reasons. You can also farm words from their languages at a certain point, but it hardly seems like HG meant for this. You can max out faction rep in your first play session, and there are only three ranks for each. Losing rank seems very hard to do, even if you're trying to do it.

Maybe the worst of all is that there are no faction battles to join. Factions don't seem to have any interactions with each other at all, let alone have giant space battles. This is a huge bummer, it looked like so much fun. Factions you're friendly with won't even help you if you're being shot by pirates right next to them! It seems like the whole faction element was almost completely removed from the game, and it was something Sean was talking about just four months ago.

**Comments:**  **EDIT:: Desert planets edited to Sand planets to clarify**

No ringed planets, and no sand planets. Ringed planets were only talked about, but sand planets were on display multiple times. Considering planets look very samey in the game, who knows how much variety has been cut. There seems to only be typical out-of-bounds void outside of solar systems, so there's no way to travel out of them to other systems manually. If you go far enough out, things start bugging out, and your game will crash eventually.

**Planets do not rotate on their axis, moons do not orbit their planets, and planets do not orbit a sun. There isn't even a sun, it's just decoration on the sky box.** This may be the largest cut element, ""solar systems"" in the game are only static planets hanging in space. Whether or not you land on the dark or light side of a planet doesn't matter. This may have more wide-ranging effects than just aesthetics, as there were many things said to be governed by the planetary simulation. Planets closest to the ""sun"" are just as likely to be frozen as the ones furthest away, for instance, which may have messed with all the systems that relied on there being a meaningful distinction there, considering all of those things either seem completely borked, or removed outright (more on that further down.) In terms of player experience, the loss of the simulation meant the loss of dynamic solar systems, which meant everything became little more than a shiny diorama. This is another thing that Sean was talking about just four months ago.

**Comments:** 

You cannot scan or name ships, and despite there being footage of somewhat-complex flight, flight in the game is relegated to almost-autopilot in atmospheres, and sluggish flying-through-pudding in space.

**But the big one here is that ships are all functionally identical except for inventory slots, all other differences are cosmetic alone.** Your trader ship is as good at dogfighting as your fighter, your science ship makes for a fine trader, so on and so forth. Things like speed and handling can not be upgraded, and are the same for the first ship you fly and the 48-slot beast you late-game in. What upgrades do exist are linear progressions for your **two** guns, your shields, and your warp drive. Sean said this is a space game, and there's nearly zero complexity or depth in the most important tool for spacefaring. Just four months ago, this did not seem to be the case.

**Comments:**

Here's where things seem to have gone very wrong. **All the complexity and depth in trade, resources and crafting seems to have been cut from the game, and replaced with incredibly simplistic systems with almost no depth whatsoever in the last few months.** Let me go over it bit by bit, because there's a lot.

Positions of planets does not affect resources therein, neither does weather, or type of planet, or anything. If those things exist in some small way, they're so subtle as to not even be worth mentioning. All planets have mostly the same resources, with only rarer resources being *mostly* split up onto different planets. But there are only maybe 4 of that kind of element anyway. Maybe your planet with gold doesn't have emeril or aluminium (sometimes they have all 3 of those,) but it has everything else. You don't need to go to an icy planet as a sure-fire way to find plutonium like Sean says in one of those videos, plutonium is everywhere in abundance! The exotic elements have almost no uses outside of selling, and elements like gold and emeril only have a few more uses than those ones. 

I really don't know if it's even *possible* to play the game without landing, but even if you can get everything you need from a store (which doesn't sell much of anything in large enough quantities to be of much use) and from robbing freighters, the idea that you could play this game as a trader is a joke. Trading is a paper-thin mechanic, and there's next to nothing to do with money anyway even if you *are* landing on planets. Trading between systems also seems completely implausible, considering finding your way back and forth to systems you've been to is frustrating to say the least. 

Crafting is another thing that Sean has vastly overstated. If you can only craft the things the game has specifically taught you how to craft, how can there be some big community push to figure out how to craft them? Hell, much of the stuff you craft is only used to craft other things the game has to teach you how to craft before you can craft. And why is that? Why is it that you have to use Element 1 and Element 2 to craft A, use A to craft B, use B to craft C, and use C to craft warp fuel? Why does it take such a convoluted process?

There's evidence in the newer demo videos of more elements in the game. I think there were supposed to be a ton more elements, enough to warrant the complexity in all these systems, but they got cut. When the whole system was simplified, it became a matter of replacing them with what they had left, but had to be balanced for difficulty and that's why recharging your warp drive involves a four-step process. Everything about the complexity Sean talked about would require there to be more than just a handful of elements, and Sean was talking about **all** this stuff in April. This whole aspect seems like a complete mess, and I wonder if it has to do with the simulation being canned.

**Extra Animal AI Complexity Bit -**

>“There is a list of objects that animals are aware of,” Artificial Intelligence programmer Charlie Tangora explained. “Certain animals have an affinity for some objects over others which is part of giving them personality and individual style. They have friends and best friends too. It's just a label on a bit of code—but another creature of the same type nearby is potentially their friend. They ask their friends telepathically where they’re going so they can coordinate.”

**Comments:** 

There was a lot of talk about all the things animals were capable of in this game, and it seems like none of it actually made it into the game we were sold. I've never seen  one of those plants attack an animal, and I've never seen animals attack, let alone *eat* eachother. They don't seem to be capable of much beyond squealing, running/walking, and pantomiming eating or something. Aggressive animals just rush you until you kill them, that whole ""shoot the ground and scare it away"" thing doesn't seem to work, in my experience. They just don't seem to do a damn thing, and you'll clip right through them if you try to walk into one. Their animations are also really clunky depending on how large they are. As far as creatures following some kind of ruleset for what kind of creature can be on what kind of planet, there doesn't seem to be any. You'll even get what sounds like the same distant-sounding animal calls on planets completely devoid of life. We probably all know that call, it's that whale-like vocalization, and it seems to be the same one used for every planet.

They also clip right through trees and foliage as though they don't even care they're walking straight through a tree, so they certainly don't cause the leaves and branches to shake like in that one vid. You don't just happen upon some large land creature having a drink whole in the water, maybe because rivers were scrapped...

**Comments:**

Rivers can be seen in at least one video, and they were talked about a lot. There are barely even any lakes in the game, and the ones I've found were pretty small. Overall, most planets have zero water on them, even though they have obvious precipitation. 

There are also no large structures like we were shown, nor any buildings with moving parts. The planets are populated with small, identical buildings with no dynamic features. There are also no crashed freighters to explore. 

The big one here is that the portals we have found are dead, and we don't know if they can be activated. **But ask yourself, if every planet has most of the elements you need, and finding the ones any planet doesn't have is as easy as searching the surrounding planets, what function would the portals even serve? This is another huge hint that there was once a larger table of elements to feed the more complex features the game once had. If maxing your ship, suit and multitool can be done on your starter planet, and planets closer to the center don't have resources any more rare than outer planets, why would you ever need a portal like the ones they talked about?** They would serve no purpose, that's why I believe they're just static objects now. Maybe HG thought no one would find them if they weren't marked by scans, and that's why they didn't bother removing them.

**Comments:**

Sentinels only ever seem to come 3-4 at a time at most, certainly not in large packs like seen in that clip. Walkers aren't just chilling out in the environment either, they spawn when you get a full wanted bar. But none of them pose any real risk anyway. Dog sentinels and walkers only come one at a time, and you really have to go out of your way to even get a walker to spawn most of the time because it's so easy to take out sentinels before they call for backup. You want to know how easy it is to kill sentinels? Hit a sentinel with your mining beam just once, then aim off into space 10-20 feet to the side of it. Watch as your beam flies off into space, but blows up the sentinels anyway. Seriously, try it, their hit box becomes the size of a starship. 

Even so, you can just melee jump a few times and escape a wanted level pretty easily, or pop into any structure, which deactivates them. This wasn't the case four months ago.

**Comments:**

Obviously, we all know about the multiplayer stuff. There's no confirmation that player-instances even exist.

Beacons in that video mark points of interest on a large swath of the planet. In the game, they zoom out, but don't mark anything. You also don't need them to upload discoveries. i think this is another tip that a lot of things were removed. Why would you need to mark all this stuff in such a large area when it's the exact same stuff that's in *every* area? Marking things with those binoculars in that other video looks to be a *ton* more useful than what we ended up with, which is a green glow that often matches the background, and a tiny white dot that sometimes mark things on the other side of the planet because it's buggy as hell.

Being able to hack reinforced doors is talked about, but in the game, the only way to get in is to blow them up.

Radio chatter and glass windscreens aren't much, but they'd add some much-needed liveliness to the game.

###For all Sean said about how complex these systems were, how did they actually end up? They all fell well short of what was advertised.


Pillar | Why Does It Fall Short of What Was Advertised?
---|---
Explore | Planets are less diverse than we'd been told, and with less features. They also don't seem to become appreciably more interesting as you move towards the center, if at all. The pool of resources is shallow, and they're spread more or less homogeneously among planets. There are no objects on planets that you will not have seen in an hour or two on your first planet, and no objects in space that can be found through exploration. Explore should be renamed Sightsee, as that's more or less what you're doing when exploring because you quickly run out of significant things to discover.
Fight | Ship combat was trivialized by the removal of classes and ship attributes. Large scale space battles were cut as well, and you cannot destroy space stations or freighters as we'd been told. You will fight sentinels and pirates alone, all of which fly ships which are functionally identical to your own. Ground combat occurs with only a few sentinels at a time, and poses no challenge. Fights are easily won, escaped from, or avoided entirely.
Trade | Trading offers few benefits outside of selling valuable items to upgrade to better equipment. There are few items you'd actually ever want to buy from a trader, and few things to sell that are worth using an inventory slot on instead of a gold/emeril stack. Grinding for elements/rare items to sell is as far as most will ever go, and money quickly becomes useless in the game. You probably can't play as a space trader exclusively, and trading between systems doesn't seem worth the hassle even if you can. Trading with factions is a non-consideration as you will max out in rep for everyone very quickly. There simply isn't enough elements in the game to support deep trade, as there's little to actually need, and little worth actually selling.
Survive | Everything you need for basic survival is bountiful on every planet. Sentinels pose no risk. The only thing that poses any particular risk is extreme planets, and there's zero incentive to even really visit those as they've got nothing you couldn't easily find elsewhere, not that the risk they pose isn't easily mitigated and/or dealt with.




**Considering how much is missing from the game, we have every reason to question whether or not any of the complex systems we were told would be in the game are actually there.** Do the planets get any more exotic as you move to the center *at all*? Are those ""significant"" player-made disruptions to the game world *actually* being saved globally? Is there *anything* besides names being saved globally at all if there are no fleets to destroy, and you can't destroy space stations? Do any of the things they talked about that govern things on a large scale exist? If they said nothing about the game-changing loss of planetary physics, are there less noticeable things that we haven't been told are gone?

As you can see, the game we were told we'd get is a far more feature-rich, complex and dynamic game than the one we actually got. What we got was a static, lifeless and paper thin experience by comparison. I encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time watching the old trailers and demos to more fully grasp just how different the game is from the one they'd been selling us on for all those years.

#There's more and it ain't pretty, in my opinion.
Clearly Sean was showing off a very different game four months ago. That footage is incredibly misleading, as it talks about many aspects of the game that no longer exist. Watching the IGN First from April bummed me the hell out, because that game looked amazing, and the game we got seems less like 1.03 and more like 0.5.03. It didn't make me mad, I didn't feel like I'd be straight-up lied to, only maybe unintentionally misled. **Then just as I was wrapping this post up, I found the real kicker that pissed me all the way off.** Maybe others have realized this, but I didn't until last night:
###The most recent promo material from July, the four pillars videos released just a month before launch, *are all using new footage from that same old build of the game that very clearly does not represent the one people can buy*. That footage is still being used to sell this game even now, and it's no better than what Sega did with Aliens: Colonial Marines. 

I feel utterly bamboozled now, possibly even hoodwinked. It's one thing for footage from four months ago to be unrepresentative -- development is a process, and things change. But a month old, when obviously the game had been significantly altered by then? To continue to use misleading footage in the commercials knowing the game had changed drastically? That's being intentionally misleading. It makes you wonder: if they're using footage they know to be misleading now, did they know it was misleading four months ago when they were making a big press push using that same build? As corny and melodramatic as it was last week,  I think it's fair to wonder if we've been legitimately lied to at this point. 

If nothing more, we deserve some answers. No more vague nonsense, but real answers.

Games,"Among Us peak player count on steam exceeds 388k players, a new record for the game and the first time it has exceeded the daily peak player count of PUBG, making it the #3 game on steam. This is almost unheard of for a game that was made by small indie development with just 3 developers.","Among Us has just reached 388k players on steam. While the game has been rapidly growing over the past month, the reason this milestone is significant is because this is the first ever time the game has beat the daily peak player count of PUBG and has taken the #3 spot on steam. The game is only behind CS:GO and Dota 2 at the moment. While PUBG, at one point, would peak at 3.2m players daily and held the #1 for a full year, the game has now lost nearly 90% of its player base due to the lack of content updates and frequent game breaking bugs.

While there have been other games which have had player counts this high for a while (i.e. GTA5, Fallout 4), what makes this so impressive is that the was made by small indie development with just 3 developers. For the majority of the development lifecycle, it was just 1 developer working on it.

Please note this 388k is only on steam, there are probably even more on mobile since the game is free to play on there.

Games,Giantbomb Unlikely to Review Fallout 76. Gerstmann: “I’m not going to subject myself to another 20-30 hours of this mess to just put a number on it.”,"In the second Fallout 76 Review Thread people were postulating that critics were scared of giving a Bethesda game a bad score and were withholding their reviews. In light of that, it felt worth putting this out there: yesterday Jeff Gerstmann of Giantbomb.com said it’s unlikely his site will have a review of it because nobody likes the game enough to finish it. 

Of the west coast crew on the podcast, only Brad Shoemaker mentioned the possibility of playing more. Given that the east coast crew has barely mentioned Fallout 76’s existence in their podcasts, they are probably in the same “staff” that Gerstmann said was uninterested. Most of the staff has dabbled in Fallout 76 and moved back to RDR2, onward to Hitman 2 and other new releases, or are playing games they think they’ll need to discuss in Game of the Year podcasts. 

Gerstmann’s exact quote from yesterday’s Bombcast was, **“No one on staff wants to play anymore of this videogame [Fallout 76]. I’m not going to subject myself to another 20-30 hours of this [expletive] mess to just put a number on it. My number is ‘Don’t play this game’.”**

By “number,” he obviously meant giving the game a score.

[You can get their thoughts on what they’ve played from the podcast itself, which I'm linking with a time stamp for their discussion of the game.](https://youtu.be/ytnL9Ju-hZo?t=1745) The room was a mixture of confusion over design choices and general negativity. Gerstmann feels Fallout needed refinement and drastic improvements after Fallout 4, and that all other complaints aside, Fallout 76 has simply stripped things out rather than improving anything.",gaming

https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2019/2/26/18233557/red-dead-online-update-february-26-patch-notes

In reality, one of the two new weapons is now listed as coming soon, as well as some of the new clothing options. Emotes are now purchasable for $100+ or gold bars (Boins). It's clear Rockstar wants players to spend money on their premium currency because hunting activities which were already low paying have been cut in half, so these weapons and cosmetics are effectively 2x as costly for players who hunt for their income. 

The Evans Repeater was listed as part of this patch but is now ""coming soon"" even though one of the new daily assignments requires getting kills with it. The repeater appears to be an online only addition as it does not appear at all in single player stores. The other gun, the ""rare shotgun"" is a double barrel which is actually worse than the normal double barrel when ungraded. 

New activities are bugged and unavailable , and the only bug fixes made in this patch appear to have been ones that allowed players to make money too quickly. While horses still reset to bond level 1 and beard styles are not selectable, Rockstar targeted three star pelts dropping from one star animals under certain conditions and using animal carcasses to bait finish was removed completely.

---------

I'm your average board gamer - late 20's, one kid, large collection, into eurogames... except that I'm not a man, and that makes all the difference in how I'm treated.


1. When I ask a certain (male) employee at a FLGS a question about board games, I often get a one-word answer and no offer of further help. My husband walks up to the counter and the employee smiles at him, makes small talk, offers to help, and asks questions about what else he's into. I didn't notice this until my husband pointed it out - I'm not seeking our reasons to be offended. Quite the contrary - I am so used to the sexism that it often doesn't register to me until someone else points it out to me. I definitely avoid that FLGS now.

2. Twice, when I have tried to join board gaming nights, men have frowned at me and asked me if my husband got me into my hobby and why he isn't here playing tonight.

3. When I bring this up in /r/boardgaming, my comments are usually downvoted into the negatives, while the men who explain to me why I'm wrong about things that happened to me are upvoted.

4. My mother went into a FLGS and asked if they had interesting chess sets for a gift. The employee said, very slowly and carefully, as if she were a child, ""Uh, we sell MODERN board games here."" My father went to the same FLGS a day later and asked about it and was immediately shown to several unusual chess sets, because of course they had chess sets. My mother has never been back to a FLGS, though.

5. I tend to dress conservatively. That definitely hasn't stopped men at board gaming meetups from staring down my top or making comments about my body.

6. I stopped going to board gaming nights because, more often than not, a man would make a comment about my gender and how it related to the games I was interested in, my ability to learn, or why I was at the event at all.

7. When I took a female friend to a board gaming meetup, a man physically trapped her in a corner with his body to tell her all about whatever the new hotness was at the time. Guess how many times she's been back to one? (And before you tell me that it was her fault - she was half his size and she could not have left the corner without physically shoving him, while his feet were planted and he leaned over her. No one else seemed to think that this was a problem.)

8. Four strangers around a board gaming table. I mention that we were playing a rule incorrectly. They looked at me and looked away. Two turns later, a male player said that we were playing a rule incorrectly. The other men immediately grabbed the rulebook, looked it up, and praised him for remembering. It was the same rule I mentioned. 

8. People keep telling me that because I have zero proof, I'm definitely wrong. Very few of these events took longer than five seconds. I don't wear a body cam to record all footage of how every single person at a tabletop event behaves. Even if I and other women women are wrong half the time about what we say happens, that's still a pretty significant number of unwelcoming, unpleasant, or threatening events that are happening to people *solely because they are women.* 


I'm tired of being polite and non-accusatory. There is a problem with how women are treated in this hobby. It's not the Magic players. It's not a few random men. It's pervasive and it's frustrating and, since it doesn't impact the majority, it's not taken seriously. At the same time, men wonder why so few women are in the hobby. Often, I see a lack of interest in difficult games blamed. That's wrong. The reason women don't join the hobby is not the games, it's the men.


If you think that the problem isn't a big deal because lots of people are nice, you're wrong.

If you think that the problem is only at cons, you're wrong.

If you think the problem is only obvious creeps, you're wrong.

If you think that the problem is only blatant sexual assault, you're wrong.

If you think that there is no problem, you're *very* wrong.

boardgames,My little boardgamer.,"I've been playing boardgames with my son who is now 5 years old, since he was 3. It's not a daily activity. But a couple times week I try to make the time to sit down with him and connect over cardboard. Nearly every purchase I make is made with the consideration of *""will this be something my kid might like to play someday""*?

One of his favorite games, as of late, has been Quarriors. Although I don't personally love the game. I *love* playing it with him. It has fun colorful dice and monsters, which he enjoys. And I enjoy it gives him a chance to practice some basic reading, simple addition, and start understanding probabilities. 

I work virtually from home and my son gets home from Kindergarten about an hour before I wrap my work day. He normally watches cartoons for a bit until I'm done. Like usual, yesterday after getting off the bus I sent him downstairs with a snack. 

About 20 minutes before I was done working he comes up and asks if I'm done yet. I tell him no. 5 minutes later he returns, asking if I'm done. Then again a couple minutes after that. I have to admit, by then I was a bit frustrated with him. He knows he is supposed to not intrude, unless it's urgent, while I'm working still.

I close my computer at the end of the day and head downstairs to see what he's up to. Come to find he set up a game of Quarriors for us. And he's waiting to play with me. He sorted through the 130 dice to separate them all out, laid out the cards in nice neat rows, set up the score track, and gave us each our starting dice... almost all off of memory. This is the kid I need to remind thousands of times pick up his toys or to bring his gloves home from school. He couldn't remember one rule for set up, and he's just starting to learn to read, so he told me he had to find how many dice we got to start in the rulebook. Unlike me, who can just skim a rulebook and find the information in seconds, this means he had to work, work really hard, to find this information. 

There he is, kneeling on the floor, had already taken his first turn, just waiting for me to play with him. I broke down and cried. I was so dismissive of him when he had come up earlier, and all he wanted was just to sit down with his dad and play a boardgame. ",gaming

boardgames,Betrayal at the Gaming Table,"Hi r/boardgames,

I thought I'd like to share the true story, of my families first and last play through of Betrayal at House on the Hill last Christmas. Having played Betrayal at House on the Hill with guys from work, I decided to purchase my copy for the home to play with my family.

My daughter is only nine years old, for the purpose of this story lets call her Amy. I know Amy enjoys horror themes, which is part of the reason why I bought Betrayal at House on the Hill. Amy isn't allowed to watch horror movies, but she has an active imagination and between playing with her dolls and acting sweet and innocent, Amy enjoys writing horror-themed short stories. Often Amy tells these stories to her friends at school, which ends up in the class having nightmares and sleepless nights! I'm sure the other children's parents cursed our family during bed time when they couldn't put their daughters to sleep. Amy also scares herself when she thinks about her stories, resulting in Amy being too scared to sleep as well.

Back to the post, I've managed to get Mom, Amy and Amy's older brother around the table for a game night of Betrayal, which is no small feat when competing against the other screen addictions of Netflix and Youtube. Mom is concerned with Betryal's theme and 12+ rating, but I assure her it's fine as Amy writes stories much worse than anything in the game. Perhaps, I was too optimistic.

We start playing the game by exploring the house, and everyone is getting into the game. I questioned my decision to play the game with Amy during some cards; I toned down the reading of the hanging corpses event. So far the game was a hit, and I was pretty excited at picking a winning game. I could already see many successful family game nights of Betryal. My main concern was thinking how I could make the haunt a success, as nobody else my family likes reading game rules. For those who haven't played Betrayal, the haunt is where the game begins and one person betrays the group. The betrayer and the rest of the group are then given a page or so of rules with secret objectives on how to kill each other. However, I shouldn't have worried too much, as we never got that far. 

Amy picks a seemingly harmless card, freaking her out a little. I can't remember the exact wording of the card; but her character looks into a grave or coffin and see's a dead body, and then notices it's her. Amy has a startled look on her face and states ""That's creepy"", and I can see her mind starting of a new story to haunt her class mates.

Then we hear it, a little girls voice says ""Hello"" from Amy's bedroom. Everyone at the table freezes. Now, I'm pretty sure I know there are only four people in my family, and everybody is at the table. Then it repeats again ""Hello"", we are breathless as we look at each other startled. Now I can see my wife starting to shake, and Amy's eyes are red and welling up in tears, her older brother is turning white. My entire family has broken down crying, and are shaking in fear. I feel like I'm in a horror movie, as a little girls voice keeps repeating ""Hello"" from my daughters room. 

I will never forget this moment.

Being the father of the house and with no other members able to stand, I need to investigate. Slowly, I get up and walk towards Amy's room, in my head I'm rationalising what could be happening, to give myself the confidence to investigate. I open up the door and there it is, Amy had received an early Christmas gift from a friend, an alarm clock requiring the owner to record their own voice as the alarm. That morning, Amy had recorded her voice as a simple ""Hello"" and being a new gift she'd accidentally set the alarm for 8pm instead of 8am. Due to the cheap electronics in the alarm clock, her voice being replayed sounded distorted and creepy.

I never got to show the awesomeness of a haunt reveal to my family. Everybody was in tears and highly emotional, it was time to call an end to game night. Amy slept in our bed that night, and Amy refused having the alarm clock in her room again, it got thrown in the trash after my Elf on the Shelf prank went wrong. Betrayal of House on the Hill now sits collecting dust on our game shelf, it's too difficult to get out for the family. 

R.I.P. Betrayal at House on the Hill, you nearly made it as a family staple.",gaming

>""Massive brambles wind and weave like serpents in the background, slithering like snaky tendrils. One particularly huge one in the foreground smashes downward toward the center of the illustration, about to impact. A Wilder can be seen in the background, casting her hand forward, commanding the bramble.""

What we got back from our incredibly talented artist was... [unexpected.](http://imgur.com/D3gQxCA) After much head-scratching on our end, we figured out what had happened.

Turns out  our artist had no idea what a ""bramble"" actually was. So they turned to Google, and [this](http://imgur.com/a/5Gzsk) is the first result for ""brambles"" on Google Images.

So yeah, we accidentally created the most intense fantasy art which features blackberries.

boardgames,"Henry Cavill (The Witcher, Superman) is spending his quarantine painting Warhammer miniatures",,gaming
boardgames,I am never playing another board game with my SO's family ever again,"There is something wrong with both of her parents. No matter what game we play, they are under the impression that if something is NOT stated in the rulebook, that makes it a legal play. 

For example, we were playing Azul and her father was scoring tiles that were not even touching as part of his multipliers*. He claimed that since it was not forbidden in the rule book, he could score the tiles that way for extra points. While this is going on, her mother is covering the board with her hands and is not letting anyone else look while she is scoring. Again, nothing in the rule book against it so it's fair game.

I tried to challenge them by asking them how they would react if I reached over and took tiles off their board and put them onto mine. It's not against the rules so I should be able to do so, right? Nope.. that would be crossing a line and would be unfair. I seriously felt like I was in some sort of bad Twilight Zone episode. I'm getting angry thinking about it right now. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? What did you do about it?

Correction* - I wasn’t clear enough about what the father was actually doing- I apologize. He was scoring individual tiles as part of his multiplier when scoring other rows. It’s so convoluted I can’t even explain it properly. For example, if he has 2 horizontal tiles connected to 2 vertical ones , he would count an isolated tile on one of the rows as part of the combo.",gaming
boardgames,Someone asked to play one of my games with me for the first time in my life and I cried.,"I've been a casual tabletop gamer for about 10 years now and have amassed 57 games up until now. I've always begged people to play with me, but I've never gotten any takers. I've always just played two handed solo games by myself for years. I once even offered to pay some the equivalent of $50 to play a game of their choice with me, on my birthday, and they still didn't bite. I resigned myself to the fact that it was just never going to happen. Then today I went to friends for dinner tonight, and I happened to have Tokaido with me in my car. When I got my coat out my car later in the evening, my friend saw the game in my back seat and asked if they could take a look at it. I took it out, assuming they'd just want to take a look at the artwork (I have the 5th anniversary edition) and, to my utter shock, they asked to play a round. Not only them, but their teenaged son as well, so 4 players in total. I just started crying on the spot. And now, we had such a good time playing, they want to make it a weekly game night where I can bring some of my other games for them to try out. I'm so, so happy!!",gaming

It made it to the front page of r/all and I got about 13,000 messages. I can't keep up! 

Gonna be honest - I'm going to do them in order of requests I received. I doubt that I'll be able to write everyone back, so I'm sorry if you don't hear from me.

I'm overwhelmed by the Siamese cat photos (god those are amazing) offers of pizza, and people donating to charities. I think you're all amazing and of I were Bill Gates: know that Id spend all that money on you. :)

**Utter Nonsense**

**Quoridor**

**Super Tooth** 

**Spy Alley**

**Random trinket from my store - expect it to be weird and awesome!**

**How it works:** PM me your address and what you want. If you want a random trinket, make sure to put that! 

**My stipulations:** I've kept a record of who I've sent board games to already. Don't double dip, or else I'll shame you. Let someone else have their turn! 

**After 24 hours, I'm closing it.** Last time, I was getting messages for *weeks* and was a bit overwhelmed. 

**International** - I may or may not be able to afford the shipping. 

If you flatter me, I'll send you more things. I accept bribery in all forms. 

Pay it forward! There's awesome people out there - be one of them! 

Let the madness begin! 

**Just a little update here**: If you request a game - SEND ME YOUR ADDRESS. I'm not psychic people. I don't know where you live! Also, if I don't reply immediately, it's obviously because I'm way too important. Don't worry, I'm collecting your info, and you'll receive a message as soon as it gets sent out. :) 

**Another update** - just to make this easier for me to sort out, if you want to send me an actual thing in the mail, mention my user name so in my messages I can sort it by ""username mentions"" and I can send you a PM with my address, since I've got like 1500 PMs to sort through. (The Siamese cat drawings are AMAZING). 

If you want to donate something in my honor, I'd love it if you donated to a children's cancer ward! They always need stuff to keep them entertained!

ShouldIbuythisgame,This subreddit should enable polls.,"I’d personally find it easier to decide on whether or not to buy a game if people voted in a poll. e.g. if they like/dislike a game, or if I should/shouldn’t buy a game. Then the comments can be used for people to go more in depth. Sometimes there’s a lot of comments and tough to get a straight answer. Using polls can help keep a tally, and this option should be available when posting. Would anyone else like to see this?

- Edit 1: My first award - thank you kind stranger!
- Edit 2: As per your advice, I have now messaged two of the mods with a link to this post. Let’s see what happens! Also, u/JohnSinger has kindly created a poll on this very issue (https://www.strawpoll.me/20569792). Please feel free to express your opinion via this poll as well. Thanks!
- Edit 3: I’ve seen a lot of comments expressing skepticism about the use of polls. Just wanted to give an example of how an OP can use them. 
1) there is an option to choose text or poll. OP can do what they prefer.
2) if OP chooses to use a poll to decide whether or not to buy a game, the poll could be “should I buy Spiderman (PS4)?” The options could be Yes/No/Don’t know (or something like that). OP can then comment in the post about what kinds of games s/he likes, or any relevant info. This will help people make an informed vote tailored to the OP. If someone wants to give more in-depth recommendations, or explain their vote, they can comment on the post. Polls will give a general overview of opinions (since you can see how many people voted for each option) and make decisions easier. Anyone with negative thoughts on a game would get a voice, rather than being downvoted to the bottom of the comments. Polls would also eliminate lazy, one-word comments. You can even have polls where the OP compares several games and people vote on which one is best for the OP to play next. 
This is just how I’d do it.
- Edit 4: Polls are now available! We did it!",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,Don't buy Steam games until Tomorrow 18:00 GMT because of the expected annual Winter Sale!,"Steam Winter Sale 2020: December 22 to January 5

How long do Steam sales last?

The Summer and Winter sales are the big ones. They tend to last two weeks (ish). The Spring and Black Friday Autumn sales last about one week. 



Which is the best Steam Sale?

We tend to see the biggest discounts in the Summer and Winter sales, and the Summer sales tend to be the best. Autumn and Winter sales tend to be a bit too close to the Fall release season to allow for significant discounts on new releases. By the following summer you can get great discounts on relatively new games.

So a question with 0 thought got answers with 0 thought.

I wanna do something different. Let's make a small list of game that shouldn't be asked on this sub. Games that we recognize as the best in their respective genres and can be enjoyed by everyone.

For me, this sub always has to be used after watching some gameplay on youtube and checking ""isthereanydeal"". I assume that when you ask the question you already know a little about the style of game, so you ignore the games on this list that you know are not for you.

Some games that are asked too frequently on this sub, that are absolutely no brainers (and that I have never seen being rejected by the people commenting):

**The Witcher 3**

**Zelda Breath of the Wild**

**GTA V**

**Red Dead Redemption 2**

**Bioshock**

**The Last of Us**

**Uncharted**

**Bloodborne**

**Divinity Original Sin II**

**Dying Light**

**Minecraft**

**Terraria**

**Elder Scrolls Skyrim**

**X-COM**

**Doom**

&#x200B;

Of course it's still possible to not enjoy the games on this list and you can still be on the fence about these games. But if that is the case for you, please specify why you are hesitant to get the game.

Again, price and basic gameplay are things that IMO you should have already researched BEFORE posting.

Just wanted to thank you all for all the suggestions/well wishes<3

and to u/fasderrally and u/LauriFUCKINGLegend for gifting me games out of the blue to keep me occupied (and sane) during my recovery.

Safe to say that the surgery went without a hitch. I was out for basically a week and now slowly back to being in the land of the conscious. Can't taste anything at the moment so everything is so bland. Not that I'm eating much at the moment.

Pain killers are keeping me sane and sleepy and sleeping at a constant 30 degree angle is interesting....anything less I get basically CSF/brain juice leaking out my nostrils. Woops. Haha

ShouldIbuythisgame,Play 'Control'. It will suprise you.,"I bought Control a few weeks ago on PC and didn't touch it, left it as a 'rainy day' game that I'd pick up when I was bored of the others I was playing. 

Well hot damn, yesterday I started playing around 5pm and I played it until 4am! I still have so much progress to go and it has completely drawn me in. 

I play on PC with an Xbox controller and I feel so at home playing it. Without spoiling anything, the game is directly inspired by the SCP foundation games and lore and it does an amazing job in my opinion at making it work it their universe with their spin on it. The game has a bunch of little mysteries you need/can choose to solve and I love it. 

The game is open world but also takes place all in one building. A MASSIVE building... It's mental, you'll see what I mean. 

If you were looking for a new single player game to sink a tonne of hours into, Control is your game. I haven't found a single thing I don't like about it yet, the movement is great, the abilities are fun and upgradable, the weapon systems are unique and interesting but also familiar and the story is mind-blowing. 

Pick. This. Game. Up.

The singleplayer campaign is quite short but amazing storyline compared to different FPS games.

In multiplayer, you can choose different classes and factions, huge maps, and customizable weapons.

The movement system is very smooth, it has a good variety of guns to choose from in its arsenal.

'Titanfall | 2' is one of the best FPS games of 2016, no one knew about it because of EA's stupid publishing, between CoD and BF releases.

ShouldIbuythisgame,YSB Unfortunate Spacemen if you like Among Us,"YSB Unfortunate Spacemen if you like Among Us

It’s free on Steam and is basically the love child of the movie The Thing and Among Us. You’re plopped into a game with your friends (up to 16 of them) where one of you is the monster and the rest are crew mates. 

The crewmates have to go around the map, complete tasks and eventually call in a rescue shuttle. Alternatively they can try to kill the monster. 

The monster’s job is to kill all the crewmates. He can do this by shapeshifting to look like them, sabotaging comms equipment, and using the environment to get some sneaky kills (by which I mean shoving other spacemen into airlocks, sabotaging a door to lock them outside so they suffocate, using the vents to sneak around, burrowing into the floor to hide, etc.) 

Things it has going for it: 

• Proximity chat, adding to the tension as you won’t be able to hear people on the other side of the map, plus it’s terrifying to hear your friend scream “NO!!!” Only to rush to him and find his mangled body. 

• There’s about 12 different maps, each with its own size and unique environment stuff to watch out for. Plus some are made after places from movies like the base from The Thing. 

• A karma system, whilst it’s better to play with your friends if you play online they have a unique karma system, if you kill a civilian you’ll have less health and be more obvious to the monster where you are. It’s one of the best examples to stop griefers I’ve ever seen in a game. 

Among Us is definitely a good game but in my opinion a far better and FREE alternative is Unfortunate Spacemen. It’s one of the few games where being one of the good guys is almost as fun as being the bad guy. Also considering it was built by a relatively small games company it’s *so* well made and fluid. Servers are nice and smooth as well.",gaming

You can probably (at this state in this sub) make a post about the video game you want to buy in a upcoming website or something similar and you would probably get a better opinion by the people. And I don't want that. I want to get real people's opinions in this sub. Because I love this sub.

Also I come from Sweden so if any spelling is wrong I'm greatly sorry. I tried my best.


Edit: I just want to say good job to any of you that do a honest opinion and you should be proud.

I generally love this sub but this is a problem that someone needs to handle

ShouldIbuythisgame,Should I buy The Witcher 3?,"So I just finished Cyberpunk 2077 on PC (and absolutely loved it, GOTY for me), and I know The Witcher 3 was also made by CD Projeckt Red. Would I enjoy it? I have read how it is one of the best games ever, but tbh I am not too keen on magic and swords and medieval stuff, which is why I really liked the more *realistic* world of cyberpunk. How similar is TW3 in terms of gameplay and story related to cp2077? Having a good story is the most important thing to me. 

So, should I get TW3?",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,"If you played Dark Souls and hated it, you should buy Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.","I gave Dark Souls 3 a try and just could not get into it. I wrote it off as me just not liking challenging games, and never really touched another FromSoftware game. I had some money ready for the Steam summer sale and saw some great reviews for Sekiro and decided to take the plunge again. I thought maybe a change of atmosphere and gameplay might do the trick, and I was right. I immediately fell in love with this game. At most this game for me has been frustrating but has yet to be as infuriating as I found Dark Souls to be. I keep coming back death after death because the gameplay is just so damn satisfying. The world is incredibly immersive and gorgeous. Even though the core gameplay is extremely similar to Dark Souls, I find Sekiro to be incredibly enjoyable and not anywhere near as a dreadful experience as I found Dark Souls to be.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,YSNB Marvel's Avengers... Yet,"Here's my hot take: I do like this game. Enough of what it offers just clicks for me. I like the combat, the feel of the different characters and the campaign was fantastic, however, I do understand the criticism surrounding these aspects of the game.

What isn't great though is the horrible technical state which it is in. It is honestly fucking pathetic how badly this game has shipped. Frame drops are frequent, especially when the action starts to heat up. Screen tear is common, and I've never experienced screen tear this bad in a game this generation. Counter/dodge icons just don't pop up, so have fun getting staggered. Challenge points don't add up, enemies get stuck in walls; you get the idea.

What's even worse though is that the matchmaking doesn't even work. You know, the way the game is meant to be played (with people), isn't possible cause it doesn't work.

So, Despite how much fun I have had with it, I highly, highly recommend waiting to buy this game. Wait for a sale, give it some time so they can fix this damn mess.",gaming

ShouldIbuythisgame,YSB: Nier Automata (2017),"I've been a part of this sub for a long time, however I have never had a game that I really felt deserved posting about. That is until I played Nier Automata.

I don't know how many times this game has been recommended in the past, I've not personally seen it so I wanted to give a run down on why, in my opinion, you should buy this game. 

PLOT: 
You play as an Android, known as 2B, created by the Human race as part of a plan to retake Earth from the Alien attackers that stole your home planet long ago. 
A brief summary, but it sets the scene without spoiling anything.

PLAYTIME: 
Roughly 30 hours to complete the main story (Endings A-E). With countless hours of Side quests. 

WORLD DESIGN: 
There are many different 'Zones' within this open world game. One minute you are in a broken down city, the next you are out in the desert ruins of an old apartment complex. Regardless of where you are, Nier gives one of the most beautiful depictions of a post apocalyptic earth. In my opinion, this game creates an atmosphere that a lot of open world games fail to achieve and the design is one of the key factors here. 

MUSIC: 
Game music has always been one of the residing factors in my opinions of a game. If a game has little to no music in it, I'll struggle to feel involved in the world. 
Nier was praised upon its release by critics for having such an immersive soundtrack. I am not very versed in music lingo, but I highly recommend listening to the soundtrack if you get a minute! 

GAME MECHANICS:
I'm going to stick to mainly the combat in this, there are copious game mechanics within Nier but I feel that a big selling point for this game is the seamless combat system. With 40 different weapons to find and upgrade, you have a large arsenal to sift through and find your perfect combat style. Combos are easy to perform, but look insanely cool, often leading to multi-hit Arial attacks to chain into a heavy attack. 
Obviously the enemies attack back, this is where the dodge mechanic comes in. You can dodge pretty much every attack in the game, but completing a successful dodge you can chain this into a combo. Where there are multiple enemy's this is highly useful as you can sort of poke enemy's while being safe. 
Special Abilities are also available. These come in different forms but will all offer support in combat, whether it is a Shield around you blocking projectiles or a Big Laser that does big damage, it's going to be useful, and offers the opportunity for different playstyles. 

DIFFICULTY:
The game offers 4 Difficulties;
Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard. 

Easy is self explanatory. Enemies hit softer, you require less healing and the game in general is a cakewalk.
Normal is where I and most other players will start and complete the game. Enemies hit the way they were intended and you will be required to think about positioning when attacking a bit more.
Hard is obviously a lot harder. Enemies attacks will do 4x the damage as they do in Normal, they will also use defensive maneuvers a lot more, requiring a lot more precision when attacking. I've only briefly dabbled into this difficulty and it is no joke. 
Very Hard is only for the extremely hardcore players. All enemies, regardless if they are small or large will one hit kill you. There is no reason to have healing abilities, as you simply will never get the chance to use them. This is the true hardcore experience. 

STORY TELLING AND MULTIPLE ENDINGS:
This is the part that made me fall in love with Nier Automata. 
The way that the story develops, the character building that takes place throughout your playthrough and the small tidbits of speech that foreshadow the events that unfold. The world develops around itself. 
Nier Automata offers 26 different endings. 5 Canon Endings, and 21 'Bonus' endings that don't really make any sense to the plot but offer as a form of Easter egg. 

I could go on a lot longer about how great this game is and how everyone should play it. But if even one person takes in what I am saying and plays the game, I will be happy. 

Please check out [this](https://youtu.be/-NiyfG8Ctbo) review by Skill Up that gives a more in depth review.

Edit: Just wanted to add a quick edit to say thank you very much for the awards. But also to say that everyone that has shared their opinion on Nier, whether you love it or hate it, thank you. It has been very informative, and has hopefully brought a few new players toward the game.

Edit 2: A handful of people have commented saying about how bad the port of Nier on the PC is, and while I never experienced anything negative while playing, others have. Just wanted to add here that I am not oblivious to this and that my review of the game was based on the gameplay itself and not the actual functionality of the PC version. I have tagged this review under the PC category as that is what I played it on, anything said, still stands for other versions of the game.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,Should I buy Minecraft?,"It’s sort of expensive for me so if I buy it it will be the only game I play for the next 3-4 months. (I buy my games from my pocket money so yeah :P) I want to know is it engaging enough that it will keep me completely occupied for 3 months?

ShouldIbuythisgame,DO NOT buy The Crew 2,"Bought it for like $11, which was a great price, but even so, is not worth it. The game has an awful UI and menu system that is hard to figure out at the best of times, the voice acting ranges from monotonous to annoying, and everything is over priced, requiring about 14 and above race completions to be able to afford any vehicle at entry level. Obviously there are in-game transactions to skip all of that and immediately buy (for example) a futuristic Lamborghini that looks like it's a combination of Minecraft and Cyberpunk.


Honestly, the most fun I had was just driving around, but even then you are assaulted with pings and messages. However, the worst part and my main issue is that it crashes in every other race. I can't seem to go 40 minutes without a crash, loosing all my progress when all I wanted was some more money to try out extra cars.


Crashes are extra annoying because the game inexplicably takes about 5 minutes to load, and every time you load in you hear the same shitty Far Cry 5 music (idk go listen to it for yourself and tell me it isn't Hope County-esque) and then you have to listen to the most annoying fucking voice in the entire fucking game telling you ""oH LiVe hAs thEse cOntRacT sHit tHinGs wHy dOn'T yoU piN iT to yOur scReen sO tHat you cAn haVe ANOTHER tHinG yeLLiNg aT yOu tO comPLeTe iT"" --- SHUT UPPPP I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARREEEEE, yes I'm triggered, don't @ me!


Circling back to the crashes, they may just be my Radeon graphics card (rx480 8GB), as every crash causes my screen to flicker, but fuck, it's 2020. Other games run fine.


The icing on this cake is BattlEye, the anti cheat that reads your files and is known for ""mistakenly banning players"" and malware-like actions. Don't want that on my system, no thank you! Who knows what info it's collecting and selling to Ubisoft??? I don't even know why this game has anti cheat, very little seems to be pvp, at least in the 15 or so hours I played.


Maybe someone else had a better experience than me...


...

In short, and TLDR, this game is not worth buying because of it's shitty UI, annoying voice acting and pop-ups, frequent crashing and invasive anti cheat.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,WSIB- An easy-to-learn game for my senior grandpa? (Age 65+),"Hi everyone,

I gave my grandpa my original PlayStation 4 a couple years back when I bought the upgraded version (PS4 Pro), and he plays it every single day.  He thoroughly enjoys playing video games in his downtime, but he only plays a handful of games that are easy to learn.  He's a huge baseball fan, so I've gotten him into playing Super Mega Baseball--I bought him the new Super Mega Baseball that came out a month or two ago.   He also plays Minecraft pretty heavily, but he only ever plays creative mode.  He enjoys the building aspect, but he has a hard time learning the mechanics of survival mode.  He's a *super* casual, but I really like to encourage him to play video games because it's supposedly good for maintaining cognitive ability in seniors.   For a little backstory, both his mother and aunt were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in their early 80s; his mother died from the disease about 8 years ago, and his aunt died from it early this year.  My fear is that it's hereditary for our family, and I don't want to see him go that way.  While it may not make sense in reality, the fact that he plays video games makes me feel more comfortable about his chances of developing Alzheimer's.   In my mind, if he still plays Minecraft every day, at least I know he's not starting to forget things.

Lately I have been encouraging him to try some new games, but I have no idea what he would be interested in.  He doesn't really like to play games that have a big learning curve, he wouldn't really enjoy games made for mature audiences, but it can't be blatantly ""for kids,"" either.  I tried to get him to play Terraria before, and he played it for a little while with me, but I don't think he enjoyed it enough to play on his own.  He didn't really grasp the survival aspect of it.  I have thought about having him try to play Skyrim or other Bethesda games, but I am uncertain whether it would be too hard for him.  Although, I could adjust the difficulty to make it easy for him.  He’s not really into online games either, but I could suggest it. 

Basically, I am searching for a game that could be enjoyed in a very casual and laid back manner, by people of all ages.  I would really appreciate any suggestions given.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,What’s a really good single player with a great story?,"So I’m a huge fan of video games but I play single player games more because it’s something I prefer.

ShouldIbuythisgame,WSIB? For my son who is about to finish Breath of the Wild and wants to play a game like Skyrim (but with less rated M content). Will also accept answers for games on PC and possibly PS4.,"EDIT: MY SON IS 9YO. IT WAS IN THE TITLE BEFORE MY POST GOT DELETED AND WHEN I REPOSTED I FORGOT IT

ALSO: GUYS, I PLAY VIDEO GAMES AND HAVE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE. I HAVE PLAYED SKYRIM. I KNOW IT HAS DRUG ADDICTION, KILL ANIMATIONS, AND SEXUAL CONTENT. I ALSO KNOW MY CHILD. I KNOW  HE DOESNT LIKE INTENSE VIOLENCE OR THINGS THAT ARE TOO SCARY. IM NOT A PRUDE, I PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY WATCH HORROR AND PLAY M GAMES. I WANT MY KID TO ENJOY WHAT HE ENJOYS, NOT WHAT I ENJOY. I APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF RESPONSES BUT THE AMOUNT OF DISRESPECT IS GROSS. I SPECIFICALLY SAID NO TO A GAME AND HALF THE ANSWERS ARE THAT GAME.  

As the title says. The game being on Switch is a huge bonus with PC coming in 2nd as he has access to my gaming PC. The PS4 game would have to be really good, ours is kind of just an expensive bluray player at this point. 

He isn't scared of a challenge, he is currently stalling to go fight Gannon because he is researching, hunting, and killing all the Lynels first.

He is really getting into the RPG thing and is interested in games like Skyrim and Fallout but my wife and I think the content of those are a little too mature for him and want him to get a little older before I let him play them. 

Bonus for any ""samurai or fantasy"" games. His words lol. But that isn't a requirement.

He is really into dragons and magic and monsters and all that. Some books he is interested in are Harry Potter, Narnia, Deltora Quest, LotR, etc. 

He is also a HUGE history nerd so if we can find anything that focuses on certain time periods I think that would be really cool for him as well. 

Thank you all that read this.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,SIB The Witcher 3 if I haven't played the first two and am invested in the Netflix series?,"So, like the title says, I haven't really played the first 2 witcher games, though I'm familiar with them. Also, I wanted to know if there is any story disconnect between the series and the game and if playing the game will potentially spoil the second season for me. I absolutely loved the Netflix series, which is why I haven't played the game yet. I love RPGs, especially ones where your actions affect the outcome of the game meaningfully. Also, at the same price point, which do you think is a better buy? Nier automata or the witcher 3? My favourite games on PS 4 so far were GOW, TLOU, HZD, AC: Odyssey & Borderlands 3.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies guys. Just to clarify, one of my major concerns was that the witcher 3 will spoil future seasons of the show for me.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,I'm limiting myself to $30 this Steam Sale. Am I making any huge mistakes? And WSIB?,"I don't want to spend too much money this summer, so I'm limiting my spending on Steam. Am I making any huge mistakes?

Half-Life ($2): Started this when Steam had it free for a month, but never finished this classic. Worth it?

Hitman: Blood Money ($2): Loved the recent Hitman and Hitman 2, and I've heard this is the most similar game to those two.

Dishonored ($3): Had my eye on this for a while. I've heard it's similar to Hitman, but with superpowers, which sounds pretty awesome. Also, it has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews.

Just Cause 3 ($3): I've been enjoying 4 so far because I got it free on Epic, but I've heard 3 is even better. Is that true?

Life is Strange Episodes 1-5 ($4): I'm not a huge one for story games, but I've heard great things about this one. And it has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews.

Bioshock: The Collection ($12): I've never played Bioshock, but it seems up my alley, and since the $60 collection price is discounted, it's down from essentially $90.

That brings me up to $25.94. Obviously, I want the 5 dollar discount, because that would actually lower my price. I was considering Doom 2016, but does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should buy?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Edit: Thanks so much, guys, now I want to spend even more money. Not really my goal but whatever.

If I up my limit to $60 (so I can get 2 5 dollar discounts) I can get everything here, Black Mesa instead of Half-Life, and the Dishonored Collection. Is that a mistake, or still worth?",gaming

ShouldIbuythisgame,Should I buy a sports game this year?,"
I would normally buy Madden but I bought Madden last year and this year’s got an absurdly low rating so there’s no chance of me buying that. I haven’t played FIFA since FIFA 11 and 2K since 2k14. I’m just conflicted on buying either of these because EA just doesn’t deserve the money and I’ve heard 2K is just a casino disguised as a game. In terms of game modes, I enjoy career mode the most and I enjoyed franchise on Madden. Not really much of a MyTeam or Ultimate Team player especially since I don’t have a lot of extra money laying around. I will note that I’ve played FIFA 21 on the 10 hour trial and I’ve enjoyed it, but I’m still conflicted on whether I should buy it. Any advice helps, thank you to anyone who responds.

EDIT: Wow I really wasn't expecting this many responses. Well first off I'd like to acknowledge that I already have rocket league and play from time to time. Yes, democracy is great and I'm honestly glad people see that sports games in recent years have been awful. (I just haven't played the other ones in a while and thought of changing to another for a bit). As for recommendations, I wish I could play MLB the show but unfortunately, I do not own a PS4. All the recommendations that y'all have left in the comments are great! I'm definitely going to write em down and take a look at them when I have the time to do so whether they are sports games or not. As far as boycotting the games go, I wish that it would work but I doubt it would. I'm just glad my post brought some attention to it and hopefully it would bring more in the future somehow.

Valheim: takesn the best from most survival games out there, and compressed and compiled it into a Survival RPG ish game, with viking like theme, build, survive and thrive at your leasure.

Dishonored 2: AVANGE YOUR (stoping there cause spoiler).  
Basically as steampunk gorey or sneaky\\stealthy you want, with a superpowers twist, in an amzingly created world.

Witcher 3:  
Only RPG to date who dont only have Cheap DLCs but every DLC is as HUGE as a AAA game, YOUR actions actually matter from helping a random old lady find her frying pan too your own lovers spats, too who you side with and who you insult.

Black desert online:  
picture pimp my ride only for grinding games, ""yo, i heard you liked to grind, so i put some grind in your grinding, so you can grind, the grind while grinding!"" .  
Also has ""life skills"" or professions that is a whole seperate part of the game but is ""the life blood"" of the market place. So if you wanna kill mobs of various shapes and sizes or if you wanna mine, chop, fish, trade, sell stuff like BDOs own Jeff bezos. This game has you covered.  
Its is a MMO but PLaying with people here is really only needed for pvp and world bosses.  
(as it is asian adjacent and a MMO; you can either look like what you picture those sour online trolls look like, or you can make em look like the women of Maxim or playboy of old) .

PLanet zoo or Planet coaster;  
if you ever wanted to have vast, glorious parks under your controll and by your own creation, either for Rides or animals, LOOK NO FURTHER! .  
I think i spent almost 80 hours on ""open world trials"" just creating the parks in these.. We all know, if its looks good, it does good... (sadly the game did not agree...).

IF you MUTE voice chat i can almost recommend :  
Rainbow six siege and CoD warzone: TOns of toxic people, but they keep it largley on voice,  
But rounds are quick, you get too shoot people or disarm bombs and be on your way.",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,You should absolutely NOT but Ghost Recon Breakpoint.,"Ok so I know it’s been said over and over but I didn’t listen. I couldn’t get enough of Wildlands. Played through it several times. The Predator mission was like a childhood dream.  I was very excited when I heard Breakpoint was coming out but never picked it up because I heard it was a mess. 

Fast forward to about a month ago when I finally broke down and picked it up at my local rip off shop.  
I figured it couldn’t be terrible. It just isn’t Wildlands and I’d take it for what it was. 

I’m sorry it’s got to be the biggest piece of junk they’ve ever sold. Glitch after glitch. I have enemies that are on invisible stairs to nowhere, CQC animations that look like a DMT blast off, I get stuck inside every other rock formation and so on and so on.... 

This game has HUGE potential. I love the choice whether or not to go unguided or to play with/without weapon rankings. Customizing The AI characters is cool although unless you sync shot they have worse accuracy than a group of storm troopers. So, unless you find it for 10 dollars or less this game is not worth it.",gaming

ShouldIbuythisgame,Any simple games my Grandpa can play?,"My grandpa, following the isolation and general boredom, has decided to get into video games again. Unfortunately, he's played practically nothing since games came out.

The last thing he remembers playing is the Atari 2600, around when it first came out. Obviously something like Call of Duty is off the table, but he said he wanted small, simple games. Ones that don't require a lot of button presses.

My first thought went to Stardew Valley, but idk if that would be too complex as I haven't played it too much, and his only gaming experience is from an Atari. He did tell me that he preferably wanted something for PC though, as he has a laptop in his room.

SO, after sitting around for 30 minutes being unable to find anything, I figured I'd consult you magical people of Reddit and see if you guys had anything. He doesn't have any specific preference or genre besides ""simple"", so anything goes (:

(Oh, and his favorite game is apparently Space Invaders. Couldn't really fit that in anywhere but maybe it will give someone an idea)

Edit: I now realize what people mean when they say ""Rip my inbox"". I think I've had to hit the clear notifications button on my phone a good 20 times just today. Thanks for all the responses though, I'll look them over when the replies die down and pick some he might like (:",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,Should I buy a Nintendo switch if I’ve only ever played playstation?,"Hi all, if this is the wrong sub I’m sorry. I wanted the opinion of people who are predominantly PS4 players on whether I should buy a switch (normal one). 

I’ve only ever played playstation but really like the idea of having a handheld console, and there’s a lot of Nintendo games that I really want to play. 

For people who play with both a PS4 and a switch, is the switch worth the money? Is the transition between the controls easy?

ShouldIbuythisgame,Polls! (And other news),"You asked, we delivered! The subreddit is enabling polls this week to try them out and see if they'll help with creating more clear cut decisions and enhance discussions on games you're unsure about. Users of old reddit (such as myself) will have to head over to new.reddit.com in order to create polls, so keep this in mind if you're on desktop!

Additionally, as we rapidly approach 1M subs, we're actively looking for new low level mods to help with posts and general sub management.

I want a peaceful game in which I do stuff, build things and not worry too much. Is Spiritfarer a good game for that?","I often play RDO for an hour or two. I mostly do hunting and fishing as it is oddly comforting to me. Spending time in Heartlands with a gun, appreciating the scenery while finding 3 start animals is oddly relaxing. I also fish in the game. Lately, however, it has not been the case. I have been targetted a number of times while I was fishing or hunting. It's an online game so there are going to be all sorts of players. I am just a little bit unhappy about it.

I am therefore looking for some other game. Spiritfarer caught my eye. I don't want to search it on google so to avoid spoilers. I want to know if it provides the kind of gaming experience I am looking for. If you have played Spiritfarer, kindly advise. I thank you in advance :)

ShouldIbuythisgame,WSIB: Buying Witcher 3:GOTY on sale felt like a crime for the amount of good content you're getting vs the actual price.. What other games are like this?,"Witcher 3 and its DLC's on sale are good examples of a purchase that you can actually say ""it's totally worth it"". 

I mean we're talking about at least 100 hours of content not even including the top tier DLC's that come with it. 

Heck in my first playthrough I clocked in 90+ hours before even landing in Skellige.. 90 hours is almost the final act in other open world RPGs. 

Yeah sure it's an old game but the 10 bucks you pay for on sale right now vs the amount of content you get feels weird. 

Are there any game series like this that when on sale is a no brainer to purchase because of how good the price to content ratio there is?",gaming
ShouldIbuythisgame,YSB Red Dead Redemption 2,"I know this is a pretty popular game but I still often see posts here asking if they should buy the game so why not, I guess.

After so long, I finally got to play the game without any spoilers. Played the entire game for a few days and I was just blown away. I haven't played the online yet, but I've heard so many good things about it. There are times when it would feel more like a movie you're controlling than a game you're playing. The sceneries look wonderful, the story is amazing. The characters are well made and you'd get attached to most of them easily. The character development of the main character is good as well. Arthur Morgan and most of the gang are pretty likeable, specially Arthur. There are tons of different activities you can do (get drunk, rob, play cards). Most of the environment is interactive, strangers also interactive.

I wish I can play the game not knowing anything about it again. This is easily the best purchase I've ever done. You won't need to have played the first one since this is a prequel to it (the story here happens before the 1st game). I always thought God of War was one of the best games I played past few years since I grew up playing the old ones but damn, this game is just beautiful, and I'm not even a single player type of gamer. I have always enjoyed online games but playing this has got me to stop playing anything else.

Story spoiler:

>!First game in a while that made me cry, specially in the ending, Arthur dead, him saying goodbye to his horse that's been with him for pretty much everything. I haven't been that attached to a character in a game with only around 40hours something that I played as him.!<

Seriously, grab the game if you can. You won't regret it.

ShouldIbuythisgame,YSB Subnautica If you like survival games,"Now I know the survival game genre is full of pretty good titles like the forest and dont starve but Subnautica trumps all of those by a mile.
Firstly the game looks incredible, the way the water shifts the light rays when you see the sky though the water is gorgeous. The bio luminous plants that glow at night are beautiful. the texture can sometimes be a tad wonky but they still look good.

the survival mechanics are perfectly balanced, at first you will struggle to always be full on food and water but eventually you will have limitless food and water. Ths base building is brilliant albeit slightly janky in some places.

There is also an actual story to this game, its minor but very good and interesting.

and finally the horror is what i love aboit this game, the moments when your just floating in the ocean in the pitch dark and you hear a sea monster roar 100 feet below you but you cant see it, not till it charges you with lts fangs beared ready to eat your ass for breakfast 

tl;dr Buy this game, its scary and gorgeous and fun",gaming

The tone and style and art of the game is just way off for me. Maybe I'm being too judgmental and I should give these games another shot? I don't know.

ShouldIbuythisgame,Should I continue Witcher 3?,"Don't know if ""should I continue"" posts are allowed

I started to play Witcher 3 and I have mixed feelings about it, don't know if I should keep playing. On one hand I really loved the Baron and Crones questline and how the stories unfolded in these quests, on the other other hand, the rest of the game, like combat, loot, exploring question marks which is pretty much bloat, are so tedious and monotone.

I heard W3 is all about it's quests and story, but even then, those two quests I mentioned alongside with Kiera's quest that involved a wraith betraying you if you chose to bring it to her lover, and also the quest that involved a werewolf with his yandere gf. The rest and majority of what Ive seen so far was just quests that were banal in structure, like following tracks, kill monster with boring combat, it feels empty, not impactful, and drone like gameplay.

Im currently at Novigrad with the Dandelion main quest. My question is this, will the rest of the game including dlcs give you a ***decent*** amount of quests that are the same or better quality as the crones and Baron? Because if not, or if there are only a few quests that rival the Baron and Crones, I might just drop the game.",gaming

ShouldIbuythisgame,Suggestion: Make it mandatory for OP to list games they enjoy when asking SIBTG,"I think having all Should I Buy This Game posts require the OP to list some of their favorite games will curve the whole “should I buy the most acclaimed game of all time?” posts.

Anyone gone from playing RPGs to FPS, any tips, should I buy the game?""*

But i didnt bat an eye because it was published by EA so i though it would be another cheap cash grab, i have played DOOM 2016 this week and that kinda rekindled my love for FPS games. So i looked into TF 2 more and it looked kinda interesting, and i heard the campaign is REALLY good for a FPS
