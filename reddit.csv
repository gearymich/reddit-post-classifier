I've had enough.

#boycottea

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  

Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

Edit 4: EA have a pattern of this behaviour so I have added the boycott EA hashtag. ",Entertainment

*I am a veteran playing Battlefield since 2002, using origin since launch and one of the founders of India's oldest and largest Battlefield Community* [*https://facebook.com/BATTLEFIELD.IN*](https://facebook.com/BATTLEFIELD.IN)

*or* [*http://battlefieldindia.com*](http://battlefieldindia.com) *)*

[Battlefield India Community \(since 2007\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hewmprcl9261.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1006e648a25ab38ccd23219fd68705265d3146b)

Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected the conversation with vague explanations.

My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall 2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, Medal of Honor, etc.

I even went to call them but they said that they can't do anything and don't know anything. Everything gone! but more surprising is that EA isn't even telling me what happened. They told me it's not their responsibility.

When i search in Battlelog and origin I still get my profile.

(The DP is my real picture from my days in Indian Air Force - Served for 10 years)

# Update: Final Response from EA : ""We don't know anything about your account""

^(Himanshu: I told you that there is no such   information about ""\*\*\*@live.in"")

^(you: ok what next??)

^(you: i want my games back, I have the receipts,   the credit card transactions, everything)

^(you: how to get them backHimanshu: There is no account.)

^(Himanshu: There is no details.)

^(Himanshu: So I am unable to follow any process for   you.)

^(you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be   able to get me back what I purchased\*\*...)

^(Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from   your side.)

^(you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement   evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I   don't even have any emails on this)

^(Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?)

^(Himanshu: There is no account.)

^(Himanshu: There is no case.)

^(Himanshu: There are no such information.)

^(Himanshu: There are nothing.)

^(you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i   know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to   my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active)

^(you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games   back and get me a new account)

^(Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of   purchase.)

^(Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by   your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still   have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email  \*\* id)

^(you: why can't it be verified)

^(Himanshu: Because all your details were on your   account.)

^(Himanshu: And now there is no account.)

^(Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \*\*  ?)

^(you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i   paid to EA... your billing team will have that)

^(you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this   account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you)

^(Himanshu: I checked your previous case.)

^(Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.)

^(Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your   purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?)

^(Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do)

^(Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.)

^(\*Himanshu: Please share your number. you: my no is +91\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)

^(Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side   within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to   this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?)

^(Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.)

^(Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable   to locate\*\* anything\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \*\*  you.)

^(you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy   anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it   was deleted and would give no evidence of it)

^(Himanshu: So you can receive \*\* a call support\*\*.)

^(Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means   account deletion was requested\*\* from your side.)

^(you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail   from my id that requested it??)

^(you: how can you claim that i requested it)

^(you: that is really lame)

^(Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?)

^(Himanshu: When there is no account\*\* anymore.)

^(Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.)

^(Himanshu: Okay.)

^(you: and my account was deleted by EA so ??????   what are you trying\*\* to suggest????)

^(Himanshu:\*\* We never do that.)

^(you: can't you yourself see that these are all   vague arguments.. just going in circles)

^(Himanshu: Request\*\* was from your side.you\*\*: prove it)

^(you: provide email that came from my id for   deleting this account)

^(you: where is acknowledgement from my end)

^(you: ??)

# Update 1 : EA just deleted my only case ID and now I have nowhere to track the details of my conversation

[https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xvobr5makjf11.jpg)

My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.

# Update 2:

Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why

# Update 3:

Reddit Mod restored my post.

# Update 4:

I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.

# Update 5:

Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.

# Update 6:

I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.

# Update 7:

I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want.  All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. ""FlyingOfficer"".  I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that ""We cannot assure anything at this moment"".

# Update 8:

Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.

# Update 9:

Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.

# Update 10:

My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.

**LETTER OF THANKS**:

**A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally)** while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield.>>Having said that **I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years.** This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and **my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever**. For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. **I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us.**\>>The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.>>Thanks,>>(Samarjit Roy Choudhury)>>Origin ID: FlyingOfficer>>Thanks to YouTubers, [Drop Rate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRJsZ5d8QdIvaoxCNV9KyLg), [SidAlpha](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779) & [ReviewTechUSA](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReviewTechUSA) for making videos on this issue:>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt_E)

AskReddit,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,"As the gap of the political divide in our world grows deeper, we would like to take a few minutes of your time or express our support of equal treatment, equal justice, to express solidarity with groups which have been marginalized for too long, and to outright say black lives matter. The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**

AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.

This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.

With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.

We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.

AskReddit,How do you feel about ’how would you feel?’ posts being banned?,"We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.
* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

Music,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",

Music,"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and especially the music we all love.","Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels, stifling independent voices

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WZTV) — Dollywood on Tuesday announced they'll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

Piloted by Dolly Parton's operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it's an opportunity for employees to grow.

""One of The Dollywood Foundation’s key tenets is to ‘learn more.’ This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation’s other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.""
The program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks & Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said. ""We care about our hosts’ development and we want their future to grow because of love—not loans.""",

As the world quite literally burns and floods, it’s important to remember that individualism won’t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint — among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let’s not even get started on yachts.)

While private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year — and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 

Drake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they’re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift’s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift’s plane flew today, July 29.)

“Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.”

To create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (“the world’s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,” according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for “radiative forcing,” which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas’ book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. 

Coming in behind Swift’s plane on Yard’s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay — the creative director for Puma — reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.

While Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, “We attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet’s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z’s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.”

The rest of the celebrities in Yard’s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it’s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can’t be using both at once.

So, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard’s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez’s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). 

Reps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard’s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for comment. 

As for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard’s study: Kylie Jenner’s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake’s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn’t do him any favors.

“This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics… nobody takes that flight,” Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for further comment.)",

Music,TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.,"(inb4 /r/TitleGore)

According to the website itself: Boil the Frog lets you create a playlist of songs that gradually takes you from one music style to another. It's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.

I'm using it right now for the first time, so I can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. I'll give an update if my ""from Maya Jane Coles to Boris"" mix actually worked out.

blog,We need your voice as we continue the fight for net neutrality,"My fellow [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download), 

When Steve and I created this site twelve years ago, our vision was simple but powerful. We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.

Net neutrality ensures that the free market—not big cable—picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/), and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We’ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/), and this time we’re facing even worse odds.

But as we all know, you should never tell redditors the odds.

### A level playing field

Net neutrality gives new ideas, online businesses, and up-and-coming sites—like Reddit was twelve years ago—the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age.

We weren’t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college, we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford, MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted, because we knew if we accomplished that, we could win—even against massive incumbents. 

But we wouldn’t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website, or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet, and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality, I can’t tell them that.

### We did it, Reddit, and we can do it again.

You all are capable of creating movements.

I’ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal—starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It’s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it’s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted, but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet, which unites redditors as an issue above all.

Here’s a quick recap:

* In 2012, [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA & PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills “inevitable” in DC until America spoke up and they became “unthinkable.”
* Then, [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). 
* Back in 2014, [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/), and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). 
* [You crowdfunded $20,000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote).
* In the span of a few hours, [you made over 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)!

And all of this actually *worked*.

It’s not just about the U.S., because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). 

Reddit is simply too large to ignore, and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today.

### Time to get back to work

We’re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon, Etsy, Twitter, and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today’s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, orchestrated by Fight for the Future. We’ve already been hosting AMAs on the subject with politicians (like [Senator Schatz](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6k27ny/im_us_senator_brian_schatz_lead_democrat_on_the/)) and journalists (like [Brian Fung from the Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6lfkwh/im_brian_fung_a_washington_post_reporter_covering/)). Today we’re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve, our CEO, with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting, [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn’t joined in yet, now’s the time! (And you’ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.)

*The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1), so it’s on us as citizens to tell them—and our representatives in the Senate and House—how important the open internet is to our economy, our society, and especially for when we’re bored at work.*

I invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation, upvote stories about net neutrality’s importance to keep them top of mind, [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/), and, most importantly, [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet.

This is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents.

--Alexis

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

blog,An update on the fight for the free and open internet,"**Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

*****

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what’s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You’ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday’s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCC’s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality’s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don’t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don’t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC’s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel’s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to “make a ruckus” to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we’re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to — if it comes to it — the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

Redditors engaged with a number of world events in 2019, including the[ Hong Kong protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/bykz7o/a_protest_of_103_million_people_in_a_city_with_a/),[ net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ay0vwy/congress_introduces_save_the_internet_act_to/),[ vaccinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/abx582/my_parents_denied_me_vaccinations_as_a_child/) and the[ #Trashtag movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/dak982/couldnt_let_this_field_next_to_a_store_filled/).

blog,Rest in Grumpiness,"On September 22, 2012, we were introduced to Tardar Sauce [in a post to r/pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10bu17/meet_grumpy_cat/).

Tardar Sauce, lovingly nicknamed Grumpy Cat, was more than an icon in meme culture. Grumpy Cat was a symbol of the mild annoyance that exists in each and every one of us. As part of the Reddit community for over 6 years, she will be sorely missed. 

In true Reddit fashion, Grumpy Cat is being celebrated in a number of ways in different communities—from [r/cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/bpozxa/the_iconic_grumpy_cat_has_passed_away_today/) and [r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/bppwbz/grumpy_cat_one_of_the_foundations_to_this_current/) to [Lego fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/bpqd4q/rip_grumpy_cat_you_will_sorely_be_missed/), [Minecrafters](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bppeh6/happiness_from_minecrafts_10anniversary_sadness/), and [u/Shitty\_Watercolour](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/bpq02r/rest_in_peace_grumpy_cat/).

[Creddit: u\/Shitty\_Watercolour.](https://preview.redd.it/87cijjyyity21.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fcd37b5dec8aacb4618b82eab0aa171122b4184)

Grumpy Cat touched our lives and our Snoo pillows in a visit to Reddit HQ in 2015. She truly was as unimpressed by us as she seemed online. We will forever remember her sitting upon her Snoo throne, drifting off to sleep from boredom in dealing with us simple peasants.

[Grumpy Cat—of House Tardar Sauce, First of Her Name, the Unsmiling, Queen of the Memes—Sits Upon the Squishable Snoo Throne \(2015, colorized\)](https://preview.redd.it/8zngfck2jty21.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3bb12aa67a8cb3688f28e0c6bfdeb5be0a94a8d5)

The spirit of Grumpy Cat will live on inside each of our hearts. Every time a headphone is ripped from your ear. Every time you knock your head on an inanimate object. Every time someone talks over an important scene in *Game of Thrones*, someone tells you to “calm down,” or chews really loudly with their mouth open – Grumpy Cat is with you.  

So, on this morning that has already made the internet a much sadder, grumpier place to be, we pay tribute to the queen of cats and memes and cat memes. We invite all of you to do the same.  

Please feel free to post any Grumpy Cat tributes we missed in the comments.",Entertainment

# Here’s what’s new March 30th–April 13th

**Big improvements for Reddit search are on the way, and we want your help**  
As was [announced in r/changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mharom/whats_up_with_reddit_search/), we’re focusing on creating a better search experience this year by more than doubling the number of people working on improving search and creating an entirely new team solely devoted to search experiences. 

Over the past few months, the Search team has been creating a search experience that can support the millions of posts, communities, and people that make up the Reddit platform (aka working on infrastructure). Now that the foundation is in place, the next phase is improving search in ways that deliver better results and help redditors find the content they’re looking for faster. 

This will include:

* Redesigning the search results UI from top to bottom
* Improving our understanding of query intent, so even if someone types something different than what they’re looking for, we can still surface relevant results
* Including suggestions for misspelled searches (also known as spellcheck)
* Improving post ranking algorithms so all results are more relevant
* Improving searching within a community on desktop
* Making better search suggestions as you type in the search bar
* Enabling you to search comments

But this list is incomplete… what else should be on it? To get to a truly effective search experience, we’d like to hear more from redditors. [Take this quick survey to let us know what you think of Reddit search](https://forms.gle/MRYG1uVQkc8w2TNL9), what is and isn’t working for you, and how you think we can make it better.

**Helping new moderators set up their communities**  
Creating a new community can be tricky and confusing for first-time moderators, so we’ve created some step-by-step tips that [help new moderators set up and start to grow their communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mmwdrh/new_community_creator_onboarding_tool/). The steps include things like adding a welcome message, making a sticky post, or sharing your community. Steps are by no means requirements to create and mod a community, but provide brand new mods with some guidance to get their community up and running. Right now the feature is live with 30% of new communities on the web, and will be rolling out to 30% of iOS new community creators this week and 30% of new Android community creators in early May.

**Improving notifications, episode IV**  
As part of the ongoing effort to improve notifications (see previous updates for episodes [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/l0uh11/updates_to_notifications_avatar_enhancements_a/), [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/), and [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/llhks0/simplified_posts_feature_glow_ups_and_continued/)), we’re testing a new change that’s like air traffic control, only for push notifications. To improve the frequency that redditors receive notifications (aka to make sure active redditors aren’t bombarded with too many of them), we’re testing out sending fewer notifications based on how many notifications someone has received in the last 24 hours or how long it’s been since their last notification. This test is only temporary, to see if redditors find it helpful. 

**Rolling out to more platforms and more redditors**  
A few things we’ve shared in previous updates are coming to more platforms and rolling out to more people. 

* The [new and improved avatar builder](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lw6zty/welcome_messages_a_better_way_to_build_your/) has rolled out to the web, Android, and iOS
* Now visitors to the mobile website can sign up via a magic link (a link we send to your email) just like iOS, Android, and the web 
* An updated inbox on desktop is rolling out to 95% now 

**Bugs and small fixes**  
Here’s what’s up with the native apps:

Android:

* You can roll over someone's username to start a chat with them again
* Videos won’t automatically unmute for a moment when you start playing them anymore

iOS:

* Moving forward, we’ll only support iOS 13.0 and above
* Now you can double tap on images to zoom in to them
* The “Add new Custom Feed"" button doesn’t overlap other elements on the custom feed screen anymore
* Saving a video post won’t freeze the video anymore

That’s all for this week. Let us know what you think (we know you will), and ask any questions you may have.",Entertainment

blog,"Hey, we're here to talk about that desktop redesign you're all so excited about!","Hi All,

As [u/spez](/user/spez) has mentioned a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/) [now](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/), we’ve been hard at work redesigning Reddit. It’s taken over a year and, starting today, we’re launching a mini blog series on r/blog to share our process. Over the next few weeks, we’re going to cover a few different topics: 

* **the thinking behind the redesign** \- our approach to creating a better desktop experience for everyone \(hey, that’s today’s blog post!\),
* **moderation in the redesign** \- new tools and features to make moderating on desktop easier,
* **Reddit's evolution** \- a look at how we've changed \(and not changed\) over the years,
* **our approach to the design** \- how we listened and responded to users, and 
* **the redesign architecture** \- a more technical, “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s code stack.

But first, let’s start with the big question on many of your minds right now.

### Why are we redesigning our Web Experience?

We know, we know: you love the old look of Reddit \(which [u/spez](/user/spez) lovingly described as “dystopian Craigslist”\). To start, there are two major reasons:

#### To build features faster:

Over the years, we’ve received countless requests and ideas to develop features that would improve Reddit. However, our current code base has been largely the same since we launched...more than 12 years ago. This is problematic for our engineers as it introduces a lot of tech debt that makes it difficult to build and maintain features. Therefore, our first step in the redesign was to update our code base. 

#### To make Reddit more welcoming: 

What makes Reddit so special are the thousands of subreddits that give people a sense of community when they visit our site. At Reddit’s core, our mission is to help you connect with other people that share your passions. However, today it can be hard for new redditors or even longtime lurkers to find and join communities.  \(If you’ve ever shown Reddit to someone for the very first time, chances are you’ve seen this confusion firsthand.\) We want to make it easier for people to enjoy communities and become a part of Reddit. We’re still in the early stages, but we’re focused on bringing communities and their personalities to Popular and Home, by exposing global navigation, community avatars to the feed, and more.

### How are we approaching the redesign?

We want everyone to feel like they have a home on Reddit, which is why we want to put communities first in the redesign. We also want communities to feel unique and have their own identity. We started by partnering with a small group of moderators as we began initial user testing early last year. Moderators are responsible for making Reddit what it is, so we wanted to make sure we heard their feedback early and often as we shaped our desktop experience. Since then, we’ve done countless testing sessions and interviews with both mods and community members. This went on for several months as we we refined our designs \(which we’ll talk about in more detail in our “Design Approach” blog post\). 

As soon as we were ready to let the first group of moderators experience the redesign, we created a subreddit to have candid conversations around improving the experience as we continued to iterate. The subreddit has had over 1,000 conversations that have shaped how we prioritize and build features. We expected to make big changes based on user feedback from the beginning, and we've done exactly that throughout this process, making shifts in our product plan based on what we heard from you. At first, we added people in slowly to learn, listen to feedback, iterate, and continue to give more groups of users access to the alpha. Your feedback has been instrumental in guiding our work on the redesign. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far.

### What are some of the new features we can expect?

Part of the redesign has been about updating our code base, but we're also excited to introduce new features. Just to name a few:

**Change My View**

Now you can Reddit your way, based on your personal viewing preferences. Whether you’d prefer to browse Reddit in [Card view](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) \(with auto\-expanded gifs and images\), [Classic view](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) \(with a similar feel as the iconic Reddit look: clean and concise\) or [Compact view](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif) \(with posts condensed to make titles and headlines most prominent\), you can choose how you browse.

**Infinite Scroll & Updated Comments Experience**

With [infinite scroll](https://i.redd.it/hituybj6hnd01.gif), the Reddit content you love will never end, as you keep scrolling... and scrolling... and scrolling... forever. We’re also introducing a lightbox that combines the content and comments so you can instantly join the conversation, then get right back to exploring more posts. 

**Fancy Pants Editor**

Finally, we’ve created a new way to post that doesn't require markdown \(although **you** *can* \^still \^\^use \^\^\^it! \) and lets you post an [image and text](https://i.redd.it/vco5jc8egnd01.gif) within the same post.

### What’s next?

Right now, we’re continuing to work hard on all the remaining features while incorporating more recent user feedback so that the redesign is in good shape when we extend our testing to more redditors. In a few weeks, we’ll be giving all moderators access. We want to make sure moderators have enough time to test it out and give us their feedback before we invite others to join. After moderators, we’ll open the new site to our beta users and gather more feedback \([here’s how to join as a ](https://i.redd.it/kyhqk5c55gd01.gif)beta tester\). We expect everyone to have access in just a few months! 

In two weeks, we’ll be back for our next post on moderation in the redesign. We will be sticking around for a few hours to answer questions as well. ",Entertainment

blog,remember the human,"Hi reddit. cupcake here.

I wanted to bring up an important reminder about how folks interact with each other online. It is not a problem that exists solely on reddit, but rather the internet as a whole. The internet is a wonderful tool for interacting with people from all walks of life, but the anonymity it can afford can make it easy to forget that really, on the other end of the screens and keyboards, we're all just people. Living, breathing, people who have lives and goals and fears, have favorite TV shows and books and methods for breeding Pokemon, and each and every last one of us has opinions. Sure, those opinions might differ from your own. But that’s okay! People are entitled to their opinions. When you argue with people in person, do you say as many of the hate filled and vitriolic statements you see people slinging around online? Probably not. Please think about this next time you're in a situation that makes you want to lash out. If you wouldn't say it to their face, perhaps it's best you don't say it online.

Try to be courteous to others. See someone having a bad day? Give them a compliment or ask them a thoughtful question, and it might make their day better. Did someone reply to your comment with valuable insights or something that cheered you up? Send them a quick thanks letting them know you appreciate their comment.

So I ask you, the next time a user picks a fight with you, or you get the urge to harass another user because of something they typed on a keyboard, please... remember the human.",Entertainment

blog,Diamond Hands on the Data 💎🙌📈,"Hey there redditors! 

In case you’ve been living under a rock or didn’t see the rockets firing off for Pluto, r/WallStreetBets has had quite a week, uncovering sources of deep value. Since things are moving fast, and there’s a lot of “detailed” analyses and data flying around, we figured it was a good time to share some notable user activity and traffic insights pertaining to what we’ve been seeing over the last week.  

First off, here’s what Reddit’s platform traffic has looked like over the last week, with the week before for comparison, in arbitrary Reddit traffic units.

[Site-wide week over week traffic growth. Blue is last week. Red is this week.  ](https://preview.redd.it/m46xz6ohjpf61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fd4f3507ce026c39a021cfe85cece5be8f854ea)

Over the past 15 years, we’ve become well seasoned when it comes to scaling up and mitigating ever increasing volumes of traffic. And, though we’ve employed the tricks of the trade with autoscaling, seeing a >35% uptick in sustained peak traffic in one day is decidedly *not normal*. 

\[Huge props to our Infrastructure and SRE teams (who [are hiring](https://www.redditinc.com/careers)) for HODLing and keeping this particular rocket flying during last week and minimizing the few interruptions we did have.\]  

Unsurprisingly, this is *mostly* due to a giant influx of users to r/WallStreetBets, which has shown a *slight* but noticeable uptick in traffic: 

[Views of r\/WallStreetBets by hour for the last few weeks.](https://preview.redd.it/6083eggljpf61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=387d019fc3cfde82942159a6e4f11e5674dacf02)

Notably between January 24th-30th, there was a 10x increase of new users viewing r/WallStreetBets. So, importantly, we now have a *much better* notion internally of “market hours” that we can track. We also found a way to track the time of the closing bell. There is one particular user (who we will leave up to speculation) whose profile page sparked especially high interest when trading ended on Monday. This particular user has *so many awards*, loading their page identified some bugs in how we’re *handling* representing awards and was causing stability issues. Here’s what that traffic looked like:

[Spot the anomaly.  It's subtle.](https://preview.redd.it/z93vn5xojpf61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc5b1e2bf2a4952bd0ba3afe3139e62fb1364da6)

“Hot new community has traffic surge” is at best a tautology, so let’s spend a minute looking at the *impact* of that surge in r/WallStreetBets. Since the community has been highly visible on and off Reddit for the last week, one would expect to see its effect on sign-ups. The below graph illustrates what percentage of new Reddit users had viewed r/WallStreetBets on their first day during the month of January:

[New Reddit user activity during January 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/oz23pu1tjpf61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e9d5e06d311b4dd3a6d16ec9816095f9ea76d1b)

This isn’t terribly surprising given how much external attention and news there has been about r/WallStreetBets and Reddit. Although r/WallStreetBets received an anomalous surge of traffic, the composition of the traffic is pretty anomalous free. This looks like a bunch of new users trying to engage in the community versus a new and awful surplus of “bots.” Over the past week alone, we’ve seen millions of people coming to Reddit and signing up to become new users (2.6x growth week over week). The fact that *so many users* decided to do this in such a short period of time is the amazing part.  

And of course, the fun wasn’t just from new users. The r/WallStreetBets community was also front and center across many of our feeds and has continued to maintain that position over the past week: 

[Existing user activity. What percentage of existing users viewed content from r\/WallStreetBets since the start of the year. ](https://preview.redd.it/vw450sexjpf61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95f527d395df19b2a4d28d7a431772ec1bd1f8c5)

Dealing with all of this immediate attention can prove to be challenging, so major props to the mod team for diamond-handling such a huge surge of users. In fact, the community has significantly increased by 5.6 million users over the past two weeks. The moderators were on *overdrive* during this period. The community’s default set of rules imposes limits on the behaviors of new users (something we all know is pretty common in the larger communities) and so together with a surge of content being created in r/WallStreetBets, we saw a similar surge of removals on the same timeline:

[Content removal split across admin actions and the various flavors of moderator tools. ](https://preview.redd.it/47shjfk9kpf61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1f5847a6395154e00400638931171dd474400af)

The volume of content removals seems drastic, but keep in mind that it’s also the *point*. It takes new users a bit of time to figure out the style and...mores of how to interact on Reddit. Not all content is original, and unfortunately (as I find out myself more often than not), someone might have been faster to the joke that you just came up with than you were. Oh, and there can only be one true “first” in a comment thread… 

That’s not to say nothing got through. Quite the contrary! Let’s take a look at what was being talked about: 

[Most popular stocks discussed across Reddit for the last month. ](https://preview.redd.it/ww753rfdkpf61.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f12525588e3e2ea4cecdc5a050e2a54e4e12cf4c)

Which is to say that GME has been a *persistent* topic for quite a long time indeed and its prevalence has scaled up as traffic on r/WallStreetBets has scaled. Near the recent peak, it looks like diversification into AMC started to pick up, followed by a *brief* foray into silver (unfortunately not *Reddit* silver).  This graph doesn’t show sentiment, however, and after a brief speculative discussion into the intrinsic value of precious metals, the community spoke up and then doubled-down on fundamentals, meaning the *vast* majority of those silver posts are anti-silver.  

Well that’s what we have for now. I have some time for the next hour to stick around and answer questions. Suffice it to say it’s been an interesting and exciting week, and I’m glad to be able to try to distill it down into a small pile of graphs.",Entertainment

*Dear Redditors,*

*Ever since the visit of one of your Dear Leaders, Alexis ""kn0thing"" Ohanian, my inbox has been orangered with pleas to ""Restore Truthiness."" The track record of your hivemind speaks for itself. Mr. Splashypants got a name. You rescued Soapier. You frightened the sweet-and-sour Jesus out of a 90-year-old man on his birthday. Despite how silly and nonsexual reddit can be, your true colors show when someone is in need.*

*I almost had a pregnant when I saw what you had done at DonorsChoose.org for classrooms around the country. I am humbled and honored (a rare combination for me), and find myself wishing there was a Look of Approval.*

*You have inspired me by helping untold thousands of students; with the momentum you've created, we could stage a hundred rallies. I might just call on you, Redditors - for nothing is more terrifying than tens of thousands of Heroes taking to the streets with the faint odor of bacon wafting behind them. Except for bears, obviously.*

*One huge upvote for you.*

*Sir Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA*

I hope you understand why. Here's the original post, followed up an update:

----

The drive to organize a Stephen Colbert rally continues to snowball. Over
5,000 people have subscribed to [/r/ColbertRally](/r/ColbertRally). It's gotten a stunning redesign. And now, the community wants to show
that it's not just another lame Internet petition.

See, anyone can join a reddit or Facebook group or sign a petition. It takes, like,
one minute and doesn't demonstrate much effort. So the rally movement has been looking
for ways to show that they're serious, that they're willing to lift a finger
to make this happen. And an idea has just been hatched: pony up some cash to one of
Stephen's favorite charities.

Stephen Colbert is a board member of a non-profit called DonorsChoose.org. It's
a place where schoolteachers can make a request for the supplies they need
and aren't getting. As the name suggests, donors get to choose which specific
teacher they want to support (lazy donors can just let the charity decide). If ""Restore
Truthiness"" can raise a large sum of money, it will be a fantastic show of
strength. And even if it fails as a publicity stunt, it'll still make a
difference in our world.

Speaking of stunts, we at reddit would like to do our part to help propel
this cause: [Hillary Clinton's
been helping DonorsChoose raise money since
2008](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/164383/march-19-2008/pennsylvania-primary).
So far, she's been able to raise
$29,945. That's
good, but we think the reddit and ColbertRally.com communities can blow that
number away in less than a week. So as an added incentive: if we do just
that, reddit has convinced a certain anonymous investor to throw in another $1000 on top of that.

Let's get this started: **[here's where you can donate, and see how much has been raised so far.](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361)**

**Update, 20:30 PDT:** You guys are donating so hard, you broke DonorsChoose.org's reporting system! (Don't worry, no transactions were lost and no teachers were injured.)

blog,The movement to re-restore our nation's honor is picking up steam. ,"It all started just seven days ago with [a self-post on /r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/), subject line: ""I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Stephen Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC."" 

This idea struck a chord with the reddit community, and it spread out across the internet. Mainstream media picked up the story. And tonight, on Stephen's first night back on the air, he spent the entire opening segment discussing the rally. (Though he refrained from making any official announcements at this time.)

If this is really going to turn into one of those *Great Moments On the Internet,* we need a place to figure out a way to make it happen. There were a few fledgling communities created for this purpose, and as of today, they've united under one banner:

Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and ebooks.","Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

books,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. 

If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. 

Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. 

What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.

> “But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”

books,"[Fahrenheit 451] This passage in which Captain Beatty details society's ultra-sensitivity to that which could cause offense, and the resulting anti-intellectualism culture which caters to the lowest common denominator seems to be more relevant and terrifying than ever.","
""Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.""  

""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.  

""Ah."" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. ""What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors.

books,I feel like an idiot. I vastly misunderstood how a library card works for years.,"So, I was talking to my wife and the subject came to library cards and how she had one. I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.

&#x200B;

I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   


Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.

&#x200B;

So, without further ado, here are my top 15:

&#x200B;

1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud ""NO NO no no no no no no..."" at one point and had to put it down for the day.
2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.
3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.
4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.
5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.
6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is ""I'm sorry, I'm too late"" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.
7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  
8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.
9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.
10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.
11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.
12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.
13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.
14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. 
15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.

Anyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.


Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it’s even science fiction.

Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.

books,"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone","It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.

Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than ""in love"". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.

Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.

As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.

Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: ""For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...""

Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.

Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.

&#x200B;

Edit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.

&#x200B;

Edit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.

&#x200B;

Edit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it. ",Entertainment

books,"10 years ago I was the type of person to always have a book in their hand, on their nightstand, in their bag - I was reading upwards of 20+ books a year. Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. 

I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. 

But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. 

Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

books,I finally had the realization that it's ok to stop reading a book that you aren't enjoying.,"I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.

Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

/r/history is not accepting new posts or responses, in protest against Reddit’s lack of action against racism and hate on the site.

Reddit has announced [its alignment with antiracist protesters](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106?s=20). We demand to know: where are the actions to back up the words? The Reddit administrators’ policies have made their site downright hospitable to exactly the kinds of racists and fascists against whom it claims to be protesting. 

Every day our sub, which has zero tolerance for such speech, has to remove the kinds of intensely problematic and hateful rhetoric that Reddit has become a safe haven for. For example, questions and answers supporting Holocaust denial forced us to establish a clear policy of immediate deletion, as /r/AskHistorians moderator /u/commiespaceinvader describes [here](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.html).

In fact, a majority of the work we do here as moderators on /r/history goes into making sure that racists and people with other toxic ideologies don't have a platform on this subreddit. 

Later today /r/AskHistorians  will be issuing a thorough statement on the long history of police brutality against the Black community.

I figured I might as well post it here in case anyone else found it interesting.

1784 was about as far back as I could consistently find images for each year that were significantly different from year to year, and after 1970 fashion became a lot more diverse and harder to summarize in one picture, so I started/ ended it there. 

It's all western fashion and tends towards stuff wealthier women would have worn, particularly pre-20th century. Most of the illustrations are from fashion plates, magazines, and sewing patterns from the year stated.

history,"With the surprising number of commenters in various subreddits that continue to confidently assert that the Holocaust is a hoax, it’s worth reviewing the prosecution and conviction of Adolf Eichmann.","On May 11 1960, Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi Lieutenant Colonel and one of the primary logistical facilitators of the Holocaust, was captured by Israeli agents in Argentina where he had fled to avoid capture and prosecution. His trial in Israel was attended by journalists from major newspapers worldwide and tapes of the coverage were flown daily to the United States where they were made available for broadcast nationally. Eichmann was not found guilty of all charges, but enough of the most severe charges were deemed sufficient to sentence him to death by hanging. Eichmann’s defense team appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was unsuccessful. They then appealed to the president of Israel for clemency. Clemency was actually considered, especially after an emotional appeal from Eichmann’s wife and brothers and many well-respected Jewish statesmen, but ultimately denied. Eichmann was finally hanged on June 1 1962; the hanging itself was witnessed by journalists.

Through these proceedings Eichmann first claimed that he was not at all involved; then, when it was proven conclusively that he was, he insisted that he was just following orders and while he had been present at mass executions he did not arrange them personally. Eichmann’s defense team focused on questioning the admissibility of evidence, for which they were largely successful (hence his not being convicted on all charges).

At no time did Eichmann, his attorneys in their testimony, or his wife or brothers in their appeals, even attempt to suggest that the Holocaust was a hoax.

Think about that. Even if you believe that the entire trial was a sham designed to railroad an innocent man, even if you think that his entire (German and non-Jewish) defense team conspired against him, Eichmann was placed in front of hundreds of reporters and television cameras every day of a four month long trial, and never once did he turn to them and say “the so-called Holocaust never happened and I’m a totally innocent Argentinian,” even though (if there was any validity to his claim) that would have been the simplest way of preventing his own execution. Do you think he was brainwashed somehow into believing he had facilitated the deaths of millions while under arrest and interrogation? They would have also had to somehow brainwash his wife and his brothers, none of whom attempted a “there was no Holocaust” defense in their clemency letters.

In other words, to believe the Holocaust is a hoax is to believe in a conspiracy that involves some combination of all of Israel, a German defense team, hundreds of newspaper reporters from all over the world, a man’s wife and family, and the man himself, all of whom could have publicly denied the Holocaust for millions of newspaper readers and television viewers and chose not to, knowing it would lead to an innocent man’s death.

history,"My father, a captured World War II resistance fighter and Auschwitz concentration camp survivor, wrote this unpublished, based-on-true-events book about the Nazis, Hitler, and their occupation of Europe during WWII. (attachment in post)","My father (1919-2007) was a London-born, Dutch national, part of the World War II Dutch Underground/Resistance Movement and a German Concentration Camp survivor.  He was held captive in Krakow, Bergen-Belsen, before finally being liberated from Auschwitz by the Allied forces. Losing the majority of his family and friends in the camps, he spent most of life trying to forget his experiences, and then, spent the latter years of his life trying to remember them.


He passed away 10 years ago, leaving behind his historical fiction manuscript.  He wasn’t a writer and was not educated past high school due to the war starting; nevertheless, he was smart and hard-working and spent the better part of a decade working on it in the 1980s.  

> DOWNLOAD LINK: https://www.dropbox.com/s/snjamtqi1kiycsc/Oberfuhrer%20Manuscript%20p1.pdf?dl=0

It's about his personal experiences and the personal stories of those he was friends with in the resistance and the concentration camps as told through the eyes of a fictional young, talented Dutch footballer who crosses paths with his pre-war German football rival several years into the War.  The protagonist finds that his rival, now a vindictive and powerful Nazi Commandant, is in-charge of the very Concentration Camp the young Dutchman was sent to, but his arrival there was hardly a coincidence: the German is intent on cruel revenge and the Dutchman must escape or suffer a fate worse than death. It’s a story of true accounts and real people channelled through a fictional story of a personal rivalry between two sporting heroes turned prisoner/captor. 


While the first four chapters serve only to start introductions to the various lead characters and begin to establish their motivations, the plot (which really begins when the protagonist becomes imprisoned in a concentration camp) is a tale of jealously, revenge and clever escape with themes that include youthful exuberance, love, conspiracy, world sports, Hitler, political intrigue, revenge, torture and deceit; all set in a global climate of rising Fascism, intolerance and corrupt officials. 


This manuscript is easy-to-read, compelling, and tells an exciting story. Even though I was only 12 years old when he completed it, I know the manuscript generated quite a bit of interest in Hollywood for a few years around the time he completed it, and that Willem Dafoe (actor) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) were personally championing the project, but partly due to LeRoy's untimely death, it was never made into a film.  That was thirty years ago.


My wife and I have spent time trying to get it published on our own, but as a reserved and shy couple that doesn’t spend much time “online,” our results have been mostly lacklustre.  But, we still believe that it can get published traditionally as my father had wished. While this is rather uncomfortable for us, we decided to see if social media can help bring us closer to the right people.


Linked is a pdf^[1] with the first 4 chapters of the manuscript to find an interested publisher for this book. We're not sure how many unpublished books-of-quality there are by actual Holocaust Survivors left in the world, so we decided to start sharing my father's work with kind people via Reddit, hopeful that a good person can help get his story out there.

Two armies meet for the final time and soldiers of both sides, disregarding any sense of self-preservation, [suicidally charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDWpbmFY6o) into each other and intermingle with the enemy soldiers. Such chaos ensues that it **looks like a giant mosh pit at a rave** in which it’s impossible to **tell friend from foe**, but somehow, the people still know who to strike. They engage in **individual duels all over the field**.

When we think about it, we might ask:

„How did medieval soldiers tell friend from foe in battle?“ A very common question both on Reddit and Quora. Others might ask how did the frontline soldiers deal with the fact that they’re basically going to die – because standing in the frontline means certain death, right? That’s how it’s depicted in the movies, right? Battles were chaotic, it had to be like that! Right?

As Jonathan Frakes would put it: No way. Not this time. It’s false. It’s totally made up. It’s fiction. We made it up. It’s a total fabrication. Not this time. It’s false. It’s a myth.

It’s a bad movie trope.

# Why the trope doesn’t make sense

Humans, in general, are usually not very keen on dying or getting themselves seriously injured or crippled. We all wish to return back unscathed to our homes, families and friends. This is called [self-preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation).

Why would medieval soldiers behave differently than any other human being?

The point is, if you run into a crowd of armed people with no regards to your safety, you die without any contribution to the battle-effort. And no one wants to die like that.

By running out of your crowd towards the enemy crowd, you lose all defensive advantages which being in a crowd provides. You will not only have enemies in front of you but everywhere around you. When that happens, it’s all over. That’s just it. Hypothetically, all your buddies could do it all at once and get as far as the fourth rank, but that will only lead to more wasteful death. This is no way to wage a battle! You don’t need to *experience it* to know it’s bullshit. Nor you need to be a trained veteran to know it’s a suicide. It’s **a common sense**. Yes, it might have looked good once in [*Braveheart*](https://youtu.be/wsYpKRbRFlc?t=12) 25 years ago, but when I see it in a modern TV show like [*Vikings*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG-_yL3KAmw) or in a movie like *Troy* or [*The King(2019)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLlxQar0mOY), it robs me of the pleasure watching it and I’d genuinely love to see it done the right way for once. If Total War games can get it almost right, why can’t the movies?

The point is, if you stay in your crowd, keeping your enemy only in front of you, while being surrounded by your friends from left, right and behind, your chances of survival increase. It is no coincidence that many different cultures over the history of mankind perfected their fighting cohesion in this manner and some even named it like *phalanx* or *scildweall*.

# Battle dynamics – What a medieval battle looks like

(Everytime there is a high stake situation, in which two huge crowds of humans gather in one place to solve a dispute by beating each other with sharp sticks to death or some other serious injury, an invisible line forms between them. (Doesn’t need to be a straight line.) If the stakes are not high and we’re in some silly football hooligan fist-fight brawl, people just ignore the line and the battle indeed becomes a chaotic mess. But the higher the stakes (possible death or other serious crippling injury), the lower the eagerness to cross that invisible line. Especially when there's a dozen fully armored men with sharp sticks pointed at you.

That is **the battle line**.

That’s why men in most medieval and ancient engagements over the course of history were arranged in most natural formation - the line formation. In small skirmishes, it might not be as vital for victory, but the larger the battle is, the more important it is to keep the line together. If this battle line is broken somewhere and the enemy pour in, the cohesion is lost and it will be easier for the opposing army to flank and overwhelm the smaller clusters of men that form as a result of their line being broken. But it also means the battle is coming to an end and that’s when people usually start running and for those who stay, chaos like in movies ensues.

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, we’re still in the battle phase.

Do you have the image in mind? That’s right, the actual battle is only done by the first rank (and maybe second and third, if the length of their weapons allows, like spears or polearms), while the rest are maybe throwing projectiles or simply waiting to switch the frontline soldiers if they get too exhausted or injured.

# Pulse Theory (The most accurate battle model)

Few historians came up with a model called **Pulse theory** (or **'Pulse model theory'**) where they explain the crowd dynamics of a battle. I believe this model is the most accurate model we’ve come up with and it would be brilliant if movies began adopting it. That's why I'm writing about it, as I would like that more and more historical enthusiasts know about it.

In short, the armies meet and the front lines engage in harsh and heated mêlée battle. After minutes of sustained pressure, the two sides back away few paces or even whole meters away from the weapon reach. Maybe some brave show-offs step forward to exchange few blows and insults. The soldiers are maybe throwing their javelins and darts or rocks. Injured men get replaced before the two sides again engage for few minutes and disengage. This goes on and on for hours, since, as we know, battles lasted for hours. It doesn't happen all at once over the whole field, of course not. Instead only in small groups, sometimes here and sometimes there, sometimes elsewhere. Hence the name, **pulse theory**.

The reason for this is that it is psychologically and biologically (stamina) impossible for human to endure an engagement for hours. If you put yourself in the shoes of a medieval soldier, this makes sense, doesn't it? If one side backs away, but the other is overly eager to continue the fight no matter what, the battle is coming to an end.

# Frontline =/= death sentence

So far I’ve adressed why it is totally nonsensical and unrealistic to depict battles as mosh pits and introduced far more realistic model of battle. Let us adress another trope and that is – being in frontline is a certain death. For this I would simply like to bring to attention two brilliant answers written by u/Iguana_on_a_stick and u/Iphikrates which you can find in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/48pumt/did_the_people_in_the_front_lines_of_ancient/).

*(It was their answers that inspired me to re-write what they’ve already written down there 4 years ago into this subreddit. Thus I begin my quest to introduce pulse theory to movies by spreding the elightenment.)*

In short, they explain the winning sides usually, more often than not, suffered only minimal casualties. You can verify this on Wikipedia, if the battle page entry records casualties and you’ll notice the ratio yourself.

Additionally and this is important for any ancient or medieval warfare enthusiast out there, they explain why the most casualties occured not during the battle phase as movies would have you believe, but in the very last stage of the battle - after one side begins fleeing from the field. Men are more easily mowed down from behind and running rather than if they stand together in a crowd, holding shields and spears.

# Shield pushing

Lastly, they provide criticisism of *othismos* or '**shield pushing'** (a shoving match between two sides with their shields) that, according to some older historians, occured during the ancient battles. (And medieval battles as well, basically.) The battle then becomes a sort of a shoving match between two sides. Everytime a TV show or a movie attempts to depict a battle not like a total mess, they depict it like people shoving their shields into each other. You might have seen something similar in the shieldwall battle on [The Last Kingdom TV Show](https://youtu.be/as7x0SybpFc). And we've all heard it in connection to hoplites.

Personally, I appreciate the show for the attempt (although it devolves into chaotic mess at the end anyway even before the rout), but I'm absolutely not convinced that *othismos* or *'shield pushing'* was a realistic way to fight simply due to it being highly suicidal. Your shield loses its protective function. It's only possible to do it in low stake reconstructions, where the people are not afraid of death and thus are not afraid to close the distance. I'll admit that occasional pushes before quick retreats might have occured, though. Especially if one side noticed the other is already weavering.

It was more about using your spears and sniping around the shields of your enemies and look for weaknesses. But I'm open to discussion in this regard.

# Chaos

At last, we come to the premise of this post. So were battles chaotic? Yes, most definitely! But not how movies portray.

Imagine this: You are far away from home. Since the morning, you’ve been standing on some field in the middle of nowhere together with your fellow soldiers, all clad in armor during a hot summer day. Maybe two hours ago, something has finally started happening and you've already been in few clashes. You don't really know what's happening 1 kilometer or 1 mile away from you elsewhere on the field. You trust your commanders know what they're doing and you pray to whatever diety you worship. What you know for certain is that you're tired and sick in the stomach from the stress. Everywhere there’s human smell and you’re sweating your balls off as well. There’s barely enough air to breathe, just like there’s no air on a concert. Maybe you’ve even pissed yourself because there was no time to take off all the armor. You don’t know what to think and what to feel. Your whole body is telling you ‚Get out! Go home!‘ but you know you cannot just abandon your place. You most likely don't even know where exactly you are. A javelin that comes out of nowhere brings you back to full consciousness and hits your cousin standing right beside you in the face. Now they’re dragging him somewhere to the back. You might even think that you’re winning, you‘re gaining ground, while the bastards opposite of you are constantly backing away. But then you suddenly find out, that your entire flank a mile away has been routed. You see men in the far distance running for their lives away from the field towards the forest on the hill sides, while being pursued by riders on horses. You have no idea whether to hold your ground or to run as well.

That is chaotic indeed. And if the filmmakers decide one day to portray this chaos as such instead of glorifying unnecessary gore just for the sake of gore, I’m going to celebrate.

# Additional information and examples:

At the end, I would like to provide some interesting examples of high stake engagements I've found on youtube, which prove that high stakes engagements are hardly ever fought like they are fought in the movies. Invisible battle lines and to an extend, pulse theory,  are observable.

First example is [a police riot clash](https://youtu.be/f7duBZFfTs4?t=151), with police being in organized retreat. The clash is happening in the middle where two crowds meet, not all over the field, as movies would like to have you believe. The most dangerous thing that can happen to you, is when you are pulled into the enemy line – something which movies don’t get. Something similar might be observable in [the second police riot clash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8OzRXUgbk).

Third is [a high stake fight in a jail](https://youtu.be/o6kMZjmM60k?t=163). As one side is attacked out of nowhere, the fight begins very chaotically. After a while, an invisible, very dynamic battle-line forms.

My last and most favorite example is [a skirmish battle on Papua New Guinea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9zD3SwhF64). Not much of a mêlée battle, but very interesting nonetheless. The best example of pulse theory in a skirmish engagement.

I wanted to include some false examples of battle reconstructions and Battle of the Nations, but these aren't high stakes situations and people in them do not behave as they would if their lives were on the line.

Sources:  Historians P. Sabin and A. Goldsworthy are the proponents of Pulse Theory. (Check out Sabin's article *The Mechanic of Battle in the Second Punic War*, page 71 in the journal *THE SECOND PUNIC WAR A REAPPRAISAL* , where he talks about otismos (shield shoving match), self-preservation and pulse model theory.  r/AskHistorians subreddit is a goldmine that not only inspired, but fueled this whole post. There are tons of amazing threads that delve in historical warfare, I recommend reading it.

**Last thought**: My post has focused on infantry combat. I'm willing to admit that **mounted cavalry combat** might indeed have more movie-like chaotic character. This is a question I'm still gathering information about and thus I'm not able to make any claims yet, although there are already so many medieval battles which begin by two cavalry engaging. If you have some knowledge, I'd love to hear about it!

**EDIT:** Wow! It was a pleasant surprise to see all your responses, I'm so glad you enjoyed the read. One huge thank you for all the awards and everything! This might sound utterly silly, I know, but the purpose is to spread the knowledge (and increase people's expectations from a historical genre) so that in the end, one day, we might get a movie with a perfect battle. Although this post is just a drop in the sea, the knowledge is spreading and I'm glad for it.

history,"This is an excerpt from a 1,900 year old letter I found written by civil officer in Ancient Rome. It's the oldest known reference to a ""haunted house""","""There was at Athens a large and roomy house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live there. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled, hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued. Even in the daytime, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.""

He then goes on to write about how the City of Athens posted a warning to future buyers, but a stranger to Athens bought it because of the extremely low price. The buyer did experience everything he was warned about and even saw the ghost itself. It led him to a certain spot in the house and then vanished. The next day he asked the lawmakers of Athens for permission to dig up that spot. 

He then says, ""the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected together, were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.""",Entertainment

I am curious as to how burrying 200,000 men alive was accomplished. (asuming it was against their will) and how a rebel army of 130,000 ended the first imperial dynasty of China, by defeating an army of 500,000  Any information would be much appreciated. 

Edit: I never imagined this post being viewed a quarter million times. I enjoy reading all the comments. A common and understandable thread is disbelief,  but it appears to me that this event did in fact happen. Of course the numbers are questionable, but consider the possibilities in light of information from some commenters knowledgeable of the era and subject. The Qin dynasty (with a population of around 40 million, comparable to the napoleonic empire 2,000 years later) practiced universal conscription, meaning every adult male could be drafted and every adult could be mobilized for state projects. ""Fielding one million men for the Qin was certainly possible"" writes Charles Holcombe, so the size of the army was not out of question. In 1912, workers on the Longhai Railway in Henan, (where the burial is said to have occured) discovered burial pits containing human remains. This area was known by locals as the ""million people pit"" and was reported to be 400 meters long and 250 meters wide. Certainly big enough for the 200,000 reported, although many think the number was much smaller.",Entertainment

I traveled to Lagos, Portugal, where the transatlantic slave trade began, to a slave castle in Ghana, West Africa, where kidnapped Africans were held before being shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, to Baltimore, Maryland, where a replica of a slave ship sits in a museum, to James Madison’s plantation in Virginia, where my ancestors were first enslaved on American soil, and to central Texas, where they were emancipated on the first Juneteenth. I learned that wherever slaves once walked, history tried to erase their footsteps but that slaves were remarkable people who used their inner strength and many talents to contribute mightily to America, and the world.

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",Entertainment

Jokes,"8 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. I reposted it 4 years ago. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",Entertainment

Jokes,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Jokes,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

DIY,"DIY - Plumbing repair that should have cost thousands, fixed by making a ""hellraiser fleshlight"" to clear my homes clogged main sewage line.","So had a plumbing issue, which became nearly catastrophic for how simple of an issue it was, that I ended up spending nearly this entire week trying to resolve it. After a lot of trial and error I  decided I would write up a needlessly long post for the possible 2 redditors that might have the time to give it a read…  but more importantly… for me to just release the frustration somewhere of what has been the last 5 days and nights of attempts...and the final Joy of success!

Essentially, I large item was stuck in my drain, and no one could figure out how to get it out… well, at least cost effectively.

With that said, here is the problem and then a DIY step by step of what I tired to resolve it…. Yes, Its long winded and almost certainly not going to be helpful for most people.

The problem arose at my house that the waste out (sewage) was getting clogged up and causing our basement shower drain (low point of the house) to flood. After attempting numerous tries getting it unclogged (including snaking for 30+ feet) and finding nothing stuck, I realized it must be an issue outside of the house. I opened the sewer cleanout pipe (the 3”to 4” dia access pipe that meets the connection of your homes waste to city or public waste) and noticed it was full. That access should be empty if there is no issue or clog.

Called the county and had them come out and check it. It was nighttime, so it was just snaked and cleared, and they informed me they would come back later to see what caused the blockage. The following day I got a letter in my mailbox of the issue and was informed that after they viewed it with the borescope (snake cam) it was determined that it was an issue that needed to be resolved on my end. This is the image I got, apparently there was a ""thin metal rod"" inside of my drain out, and sadly (and conveniently for the county) on Homeowner’s responsibility, not county’s.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgz7q9rjjpca1.jpg?width=2931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e38318a5d89252b0ccb207cd4b029b5d195ce82

Now, no one has opened that on my end, and I don’t think kids are going to find a square head ¾ wrench and open it… so more then likely something fell down when it was being accessed by the county previously and just left there. Regardless, it is there now… and likewise… now my responsibility.

What you cannot see from that image is how far down it is. The connection from my house to the clean out is 10 feet down, the distance from that to the pipe that was stuck inside was another 10 feet down. So, 20 feet (6+ meters) total down a 3”1/2 pipe that change degrees ever so slightly at the y fittings.

Well, I  have never opened it before at this house and had not seen it myself, so the first thing I did was grab a borescope and go check it out and make sure it really was there. Sure enough, there was a rod of some kind about 1” in diameter and 4 or 5 feet long. Since it appears to have been in there for some time, it quite frankly looked like a long slimy slug turd. Yes, it was gross.

I spoke with wife and asked what she wanted to try, she said “just call the plumber”. Now, I have no problem calling a plumber to help me on something, but I was more curious about what he would do that I couldn’t do…. Besides just dig up and replace the whole line. So, I agreed I  would call a plumber but before I got hit with that bill, I should at least try to get it out myself. My thought, almost no plumbing happens in our area for less than 300 bucks so if I can get it out at half that I’m good. Any more then that, and it probably isn’t worth my time and will pay to have it professionally done.

I came up with a list of things I wanted to try:

* 1.Drano it clean (as there was still  a lot of build up being blocked by it)
* 2.Snake the line hard and make sure everything was out of the way, and also potentially get the line stuck around the rod enough to pull it out.
* 3.Lower a magnet on it and try to grab it.
* 4.Lower a hook down and try to grab it.
* 5.Extend a retrieving tool (The claw type) to grab something down there
* 6.Lower some devise down and try to clamp on it.
* 7.Fit a looped rope end (slip not) to the end of a pole and try to lasso it.
* 8.Zip tie it with a sting pull back.
* 9.And.. call three different plumbers to get quotes while I attempt all this.

With the rough plan in place, I put the calls into the plumbers and hit Home Depot. Got 4 different types of drain cleaners,  30 feet of ¾ pvc pipe with couplers, more gorilla tape, multiple magnets, j hooks, and some different clamps.  About $150ish total. (Already have a good snake cam, and other parts as well as all the tools I needed).

Go back to the house and check the line with the snake cam to see what the current status was, and also just take note of the fitting conditions and what not, to make sure I was not doing anything negatively impacting my plumbing. Then I ran drain cleaners and snake.

I decided the magnet was the easiest option to try so connected the (3) 10’foot long pipes then connected a 65lb pull strength 2” dia magnet to an end fitting, then connected the camera directly adjacent to the magnet.

Ran it down and immediately  it was clear… not magnetic. So it was either aluminum or wood…. Which would make sense for some kind of tool handle. Let some more cleaners down and let them sit for about an hour then ran the snake camera.

Yep, It’s a wood pole. Looks like a pole that goes into a basic old rake head or broom. I guess someone was servicing this sometime back and dropped it down the hole and just left it.

The issue was the visible end did not have a screw off part (like newer brooms) and there was nothing to grab onto as the bottom was shoved into the Y fitting and could not be accessed. Got my 30 foot tube back and swapped ends to hooks and tired multiple times with no success.

Then the first plumber arrived. Told him what the issue was, and he said to call the county and that that would require excavation and at that depth was not something they do. Thanked him for his time and went back to trying to get it with rope (lasso) and Zip ties.

The issue with this method is because of the bend between pipes, having the rope or zip ties set in a nice open loop, by that time you finagled it down there, the loop was either off, or no longer and open circle. After about 20 more attempts, finally got it but the rod was way to slippery, and it could not actually grab it. Second Plumber arrived, also said that the only thing that can be done at this point was pull the entire line out and replaced it. Asked for a ball bark and was told probably 10k.

Third plumber called back and said pretty much the same as the others. He said that anything over the 8 foot depth becomes an excavation if it can’t be obtained with what I tired, and the clamping claws don’t have enough force to pick up an item that large that is wedged in there. I asked about pricing and he also said pretty much the same thing. Apparently at a 20 foot depth it’s a full excavation team with rigging and permits pulled.

So that little stick was going to cost me 10k if I couldn’t get it out. I asked him to see what he could do about pricing and work up a quote as it may be what I have to do.

Then updated the wife, and, after hearing that price.. she too started throwing out ideas.

Went back to trying some more, and added a few more options. Initial one that came to mind was to Mix 5 pounds of Styrofoam with 5 gallons of gas pour it down the drain, wait about 2 minutes or so and then drop a match. That would be sure to get rid of that stick. This however was not tested. Back on the practical side, decide we could try to cork screw it, put a cork screw on the end of the pole and try to jamb it in the end and turn it into the corkscrew to lock it.

Corkscrew was a failure however, due to the kink in the pipes, as soon as you rotated your corkscrew came off the end. After about 20 or so attempts, we moved on to another option. Went back to zip ties and lasso with multiple ones being able to be pulled at once, though it has the strength, it was impossible to get it on… well maybe not impossible… but it was like 30 degrees, 130am in the morning and my cold bloody hands decided it was time to quit for the night. After soaking my hands and esophagus with alcohol, I laid in bed and pondered what I could try.

Then it hit me. I needed a large tube full of nails in all directions pointing back inside of itself connected back to m 30 foot pole that I could jamb down there on top of the pole, and it would go in but could not back out. I went to bed happy that I had thought of what would actually work.  The next morning, we get up and my wife tells me she has an idea for what would work too. I say something along the lines of “There is no way it’s going to be better than my hellraiser idea” She goes on to say, “You know those antirape devices for women that have like spikes inside?” And I scream out “No way did you think of the same thing as me” So after a good chuckle we agreed the “Hellraiser Fleshlight” was the thing that would work.

The issue was, after all the work the night before my camera was broken and needed to be replaced. Luckily had a warranty and got the camera returned and the new one would ship to me the following day (which was yesterday).

The third plumber called back and said he thought he could get the price down a bit more but wanted to see what he could do and check into it deeper. Guy was super nice, came right over and ran a snake down and saw the issue. After some thinking we was able to determine he really only needed to go down about 14 feet and then he could fish out the pole by hand with standard equipment the other 6 feet down.  Got the price down to the 6K range including permits but didn’t have an opening for the work until today (Tuesday) So I told him I would try to get it out myself. If, however I could not get it out, we would pull the trigger for the Tuesday work.

So at least this Sunday I had this quote if we couldn't fix it:

&#x200B;

Later that day (Yesterday) after work, the “Hellraiser Fleshlight” plan went into full force. Bought 2”pipe, attachment fittings to bring it down to 3/4” then more gorilla tape, and a lot of 8 ga screws and a refill on trim nails.

Got Everything put together, Hooked the new camera up and an additional pencil flashlight on the pole shaft for added clarity.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15kf0q3dkpca1.jpg?width=1575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ffd892a53f7467e1bbf8de02b7af0a09e3e3f765

Went with the trim nails first and just a couple screws... just in case the screws were too strong to bend down.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnyapl6ekpca1.jpg?width=2120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=728291b3a455d0194cea610dc0c6995b667073da

Ran the assembly down the shaft and after some finagling... got it on there. After some twisting and prying I went to pull it up and sadly lost connection. Pulled back out the assembly and added more nails and some screws. About 50 at this time. Tired again and could now get it to connected enough that I could spin it, but still not pull it out.

Pulled it back out, and removed the flash light removed the camera (so I had more wiggle room) and added about 50 more screws, essentially a row of 12 or 13 screws spaced every 2 inches on 8 sides of the 2” pipe. Added a 1/16 thick aluminum end that was bevels to feet the stick into the pipe.

Then I placed it down in there and hit the wood pole. This time I pushed but only got on it by an inch or two. Pushed harder and harder, then it hit me to try to hammer it on. Connected a loose piece of pipe to the pipe I was holding and made a solid connection that could take some hits. Hit it with a hammer and turned it each time… slowly going down an inch or too at a time. Once I had about 2 feet of the long shaft inside of my spiked fleshlight I decided it was now or nothing.

I began to pull slowly, wondering if I could feel the added weight of the shaft coming up, or was just me imagining it… as it got closer and closer I still could not tell. It was nighttime by this moment, pitch black and all my cameras were off. I tired to go as slowly as I could to make sure it didn’t come out (if it was in fact in there). As I got to the top and began to pull back my makeshift giant S&M device from the lip of waste access… a saw the most glorious sight. A 5 foot shaft caught in the teeth of my predator anti-rape device!

&#x200B;

I cleaned up all my tools, washed off all the blood and waste from my hands,  (yes, I am definitely going to die of dysentery now) texted the plumber that I would not be scheduling the crew and got it out,  and stormed inside, grabbed my wife and showed her the 6 thousand dollar poop stick!

I am so happy, but had no one to tell so hope if you made it this far you enjoyed it.

TL/DR: Had  a plumbing issue that as simple as it sounded to me, was in fact a big issue.

Turns out it was going to be 6K to 10K to fix… if I couldn’t fix it myself. Sounded like a pressing DIY moment, so I invented a “Hellraiser Fleshlight” device that was able to fix the issue last night… just before I had to sell a kidney!",Entertainment

askscience,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses.

 u/PastelFlamingo150 advised to leave a small space between the wall and the curtain in the sides. I did this, and it worked!

Just took a shower moments ago, leaving a space about the size of my fist on each side. No more wet curtain touching my private parts ""*shrugs*""

askscience,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

Would they have to build a network with the capacity of Netflix just to have this capacity for a few hours a year? Generally how do massive amounts of data get transferred from one source over shortly periods?,Science
askscience,"Why doesn't modern healthcare protocol include yearly full-body CAT, MRI, or PET scans to really see what COULD be wrong with ppl?","The title, basically. I recently had a friend diagnosed with multiple metastatic tumors everywhere in his body that were asymptomatic until it was far too late. Now he's been given 3 months to live.

Would it make flu season significantly more deadly if it isn't contained?

listentothis,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",Entertainment

listentothis,[discussion] 11 million subscribers and /r/listentothis is dead. Maybe it's time for a format change?,"Maybe we just need to revise the rules. Allow folks to post music by established artists or side projects of established artists. Even when a video has a bunch of views, there are still folks who have never heard of it. This sub could be for discovery of music new to the listener, but it's forcing discovery of new artists. How is a sub with 11million subscribers so dead? 

Edit: Rip my inbox. 

Edit 2: I didn't mean for this to be a drama post, or a ""bitching at the mods"" post. My intention was to call attention to how restrictive the posting rules have gotten. Too much exposure, can't post, too little exposure, can't post. I like the idea of an artist lockout period to prevent saturation. I also agree that posts shouldn't be down voted for disliking a genre. The rules regarding votes seems pretty reasonable, upvote if an artist is new to you, don't vote if you've heard them before. Ultimately, I don't really know what to change to make it more welcoming and enjoyable. I've enjoyed much of what I've heard here, it's been a great last year in this sub. I don't want to see it fall into sub limbo due to over moderation. One Love. ",Entertainment

**MAIN PROBLEM**

Not enough people are making enough noise about net neutrality.

**WTF? WHY?**
 
People can't get motivated about net neutrality if they don't know what to do.

**MAIN PROBLEMS with NET NEUTRALITY**
* **Intro:** These are the problems that I have noticed with the net neutrality movement.
 
* **Disorganized**: There are several different voices shouting everywhere at once. People are confused on what to do.

* **Contradicting Messages**: There are contradicting messages about net neutrality. Believe or not, there are people who don't understand what net neutrality is **who are against it.** There's too much misinformation about this (*should be*) simple subject.

* **Confusion:** The contradicting messages about net neutrality have people confused. People don't want to feel confused.

* **Naivety/Blind Hope:** People don't want to feel hopeless about life. Net neutrality seems to be one of those subjects that seem way too complicated. They are trying to feel as happy as they can - if they know it's pointless because it's **an emotional defense mechanism.**


* **Circlejerking:** Most net neutrality supporters tend to spend most of their time where other net neutrality supporters are. They're not reaching out to people who desperately need to hear their message.


* **Low Morale:** Most net neutrality supporters (and the Internet citizenry as a whole) feel defeated. They don't know about Senators who support net neutrality or the those who have went from being neutral to being in support.


* **Perception:** The only people I have heard talking about net neutrality are Millennial kids. Older Americans (if they disliked Trump). Net neutrality is seen too much as a liberal thing, **and not a free speech** thing.


* **Infiltrated/Corrupted YouTubers:** Some YouTubers and Internet celebrities (such as Ezra Klein and Casey Neistat) have been corrupted with their media presence being sold to media companies owned by the ISP's. Their call-to-action is to call the FCC, **an agency currently known for dodging, ignoring, and even lying**, and instead of using leverage in order to pressure the FCC to stop. They are misleading that potential energy into a wasted effort.


* **Tech Companies Not Pushing Hard Enough:** Facebook, Google, and Netflix are not pushing hard enough for net neutrality like they used to. The people on their social media platforms (especially Instagram) are pushing net neutrality on a minute-by-minute basis but the company isn't taking a stance on the issue.


* **Little Coverage from 'Clean' YouTubers:** YouTubers, the ones who drive (and make a living from) controversy are not talking about net neutrality. 

**ASSETS that WE DO HAVE**

*We've discussed the problems. Let's discussed the tools that we do have on our side. Yes, we have the greatest human invention and that comes with some assets. :)*
 
* **Online businesses:** Online business, by design, has a direct incentive, in having the least amount of overhead and the most amount of customer reach. No net neutrality means that customer reach is **severely limited**. Mention this to online businesses in getting their support in letting their audience know about net neutrality.
 
* **Instagram**: There are businesses on Instagram that want net neutrality to stay. You can send these businesses a message about net neutrality.

**Basic Human Psychology**: **The most important thing that you must know: Humans use emotions FIRST and justify with logic SECOND. GO for the EMOTIONAL first.** Net neutrality is already straightforward. 
	
* **Use anger/fear to motivate**: If people are comfortable, they don't move. Use anger to get people uncomfortable. You can spark anger by presenting Ajit Pai as the enemy and the Internet as the child. *Motivate people with anger to protect the Internet as the child that is danger.* 


* **Use humor to create relaxation**: Net neutrality is a stressful. Use humor to get people interested in net neutrality by making it funny. People need to laugh. Too much negative emotion can repel people.


* **Use short messages (less than 6 words in a slogan)**: Use short messages that are easy to remember and unable to counteract against. A great example: **""Net neutrality is ONLINE FREE SPEECH.""**


* **Avoid depression phase**: People get depressed because they feel fucked over and they feel that they have no options. Don't let your viewer or your audience hit that depression phase. You have to immediately show the call-to-action/[Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com)

**Vast Array of Talents:** The Internet is a vast place. We all have some sort of talent.
 
* **Art:** You can draw a webcomic and share it like crazy on social media platforms. Seriously, share it. Share it everywhere: Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.


* **Infographics**: Any business professionals out here? I need you to make some Infographics and showcase how the net neutrality repeal can harm their business marketing efforts.


* **Memes:** You can't draw? Make memes. Make a lot of memes. Spread those memes everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (to get some robot YouTuber to read it).


* **Music:** Make a song about net neutrality and upload it to Soundcloud. Share it everywhere on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, to your favorite content creators that they can use.


* **Humor:** Do people laugh with or at you? Who cares, either way. Get them laughing about net neutrality and motivate them to **call their Senator and their Representative.**


* **Comedy:** Use comedy skits to your advantage to convince people in order to get them to understand the FFC vote. Make sure that your call-to-action is getting people to call their Senators and their Representative.


* **Lowbrow:** Use the lowbrow humor. An example: ""I wanted to fap to Pornhub but I need a porn package from AT&T. (**DON'T LET AT&T TELL WHO YOU CAN FAP TO. CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP TODAY!**)


* **Stir Up Controversy:** For people who did extensive research on this subject only, find a Libertarian/anti-net neutrality opponent with an audience and challenge them to a **public** debate about net neutrality.


* **Storytelling:** Are you great with writing stories. Write a story, team up with an artist or an animator so that people can visually understand that what you are telling them.


* **Sex Appeal:** Are you sexy as hell? Are you a BBW cam model? Well, use your sexy body to get people interested in saving net neutrality. Give a free cam show to those who called their Senators and their Representative. Yes, **SEX APPEAL** is an **ASS**et.

**Everyone Has A Direct Interest in Preserving The Internet:** The greatest human invention where we can see Mars at any time and even allows us to fap whenever we want. Everyone in the USA has a stake in keeping the Internet open and free.
 
* **Everyone Hates Their ISP**: Comcast is famous for this. They charge people **AFTER** they cancel their service. Use this as an opportunity to convince to take revenge against their ISP's by calling their Senator and their Representative to enact them to do something.


* **People Against Net Neutrality**: These people also want the same thing as you. It's worse to see that but it's true. They are just misinformed. For these people, use well-citied evidence that they can't refute. Also, use Pai's lies to fuel your explanation. (**Yes, Pai is on your side...I will explain later.**)

**Ajit Pai:** This gorgeous bastard is going to help us save the Internet. That's right, he's an asset. Tired of fighting an uphill battle: **We can leverage Ajit Pai against himself. ** 
 
* **He's An Enemy:** He's Public Enemy #1 of the Internet - and he deserves it, too. So, how do we make him work for us.

* **He's Smug:** We can use his smugness against him. We can show that Mean Tweets video of him to direct them to going to [BattlefortheNet.com.](https://battleforthenet.com)



* **He's Got That Mean Tweets Video:** If I was ever running against him in an election, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) would be a godsend. We can use that video, put simple messages on it, and share it like crazy on Facebook. **The most important part would be that we convert people into calling their Senators and their Representatives via https://battleforthenet.co. Spread this video around while memeing it up saying, ""THIS GUY WANTS TO CHARGE YOU FOR EVERY SITE YOU GO TO"". ""DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP"". [This video, believe it or not, is a godsend! We can use this video against Ajit Pai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) **so spread this video around Facebook relentlessly while captions to direct people to [Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com).


* **We Can Bring Down His Plan with His Own Undoing:** Ajit is literally giving us the ammunition that we need to strike his plan. We can make **fun, easy-to-read Infographics** to compare his plan to how reality works.


* **ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: AJIT WANTS US TO HATE HIM. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE DIRECT THAT ANGER AT HIM INTO STRIKING HIM WHERE IT HURTS: HIS PROPOSAL. DIRECT THE ANGER INTO CALLING SENATORS and REPRESENTATIVES on BATTLEFORTHENET.com.**


* **Holy shit, his constant lying record**: He is constantly lying. Regardless of the FCC vote, our Senators and Representatives are going to need a constant record of his lies and the truths that are opposed to his plan. Send your Senators and Representatives. Also, use Infographics to publish on Linkedin so that people can see the Infographics and fully understand why Pai is lying his ass off.


* **His past**: **He's a ex-Verizon lawyer working in an agency that is supposed to police **Verizon**. A great explanation for why this is wrong would be: **""A crackhead in charge of the DEA""**; **""Micheal Vick running PETA""**; **""A pedophile running an elementary school.""**


* **Avoid Using Trump as The Enemy:** Bear in mind that half of the country voted for Trump. 

**These are the people that we have to reach.** We don't need Trump to be the enemy; Ajit Pai is just fine **and ten times better** as our enemy and he has all the smugness, treacherous history, lies, and hate against him to get people upset and ready to move.


**Social Media**: We have social media and private messaging apps. We can reach our friends and family more intimately than any news media ever can.
 
* **Facebook**: Use videos and add banners to them or add subtitles to the video. Videos on Facebook spread faster. Be sure to upload videos directly to Facebook so that it can spread faster on the social media. Direct people in the video (or if you are using someone else's video: the description under video) to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com). Keep description short and straight to the point.

* **Instagram:** Use pictures on Instagram. Use 15 second videos to tell people why net neutrality important to the Internet. Use the picture to direct people to go to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Twitter:** Take whatever content that you have created in order to have it spread it further. With Twitter, you will have to spread it farther and repeatedly. Have the content spread with the hashtags #netneutrality; #stoptheFCC; #breaktheinternet


* **Gab.io:** I don't know much about this social media platform but you can focus on posting there. The more outside you guys are, the better.


* **4chan**: 4chan likes to try experiments in getting themselves noticed. Post about net neutrality. Don't push the issue but invite them to help.


* **Other Subreddits:** Create a relevant topics that can also relate to subreddit that you are in.


* **Minds.io:** Get people to discuss their opinions on Minds.io and get them interested in spreading the news about net neutrality in a way that is educated.


* **YouTube:** Create videos about YouTube. [This person did a great job at making the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLGMp8x3rA4&t=6s) **Don't forget to spread your videos to everyone on multiple social media platforms, multiple times throughout the day.**



**Short Meme Videos**: The shorter the message, the farther the message. **This is why I continue to express: **NET NEUTRALITY IS ONLINE FREE SPEECH.**


 
* Even if you are shitty video creator, you can still make meme videos. You can easily make a meme.


* Even if you still feel that you can't make a meme, you can still spread funny memes all over the Internet.


* You can use funny videos to get people to go to [Battle for The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)

 **Memes**: Memes are great because you can say what you want to say to your audience in a short amount of time.
 
* **Humor**: You can use memes to make people laugh. ""Do you want your websites to be blocked? Then FUCK NET NEUTRALITY!"" Humor gets people interested.


* **Educated:** You can use memes to educate people quickly - use less than 10 words and use specific examples. For example: ""Title II prevents Comcast from gouging you.""


* **Combat Misinformation**: If you have been hearing misinformation about Title II, you can use memes to combat that. **""Net neutrality lets Facebook and Google control the Internet. People can choose to not use Facebook and Google.""**


* **Action-Engaging**: You can use messages like, ""Don't let Ajit Pai destroy the Internet. Go call your Senator and your Representative"".

* **The Expedient Nature of the Internet**: The Internet makes really fast. This is one advantage that Internet has over everything.


* **Our Smartphones**: People have their smartphones. They carry them whereever they go. We can easily reach people where they are.


* **Sense of Action**: The action required to do what is very small but once people know about what Ajit Pai has done, make the action they have to do be relatively small.


* **We Can Speak To Our Audience, News Media Can't**: We can 24/7 access to their audience. We can reach out to them and even answer their questions about net neutrality.


* **Our Reach Is Stronger Than The News Media**: We know our circle of friends and family more closely. Mention it in passing.


* **Other Net Neutrality Videos**: Other people have been made better videos. [This one is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtt2aSV8wdw).  [So is this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggasfCOmQK8).  [And so is this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd27PgNJNIo) Don't have time to make your net neutrality video, **just a good one, especially the ones already listed here.


* **Senators and Representatives:** Senators want to keep their job. Some Senators are decent people and other are corrupt. You can convince the corrupt Senators and Reps to change their minds by reminding them that they are not going to keep their job when elections are coming. Some of these guys sold for $500. **Also, for the Senators and Representatives who are fighting the good fight for you, give them a call and thank them.** It's a thankless job. :)


* **Most Importantly, Use BATTLEfortheNET.com as CALL-TO-ACTION in all Your ACTION**: Get people, especially in the Red States, to call their Senators and their Representatives about Title II oversight in the link that has the description in it by having them go to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)

**SOLUTIONS**: So what can we do about this.?
 
* **Organized Movement**: I am creating an organized movement to educate and convert people into saving net neutrality called #mala. Perhaps, you can create a movement of your own.

* **One, Short, Straightforward Messages**: Use short messages that are straight to the point. They spread farther and they are easier to be remember.


* **Keep The Messages Short**: I can't stress this enough. The shorter the messages, the simple language the better. Use 4th-grade English when you are creating your memes and your videos. (**[No, they are not stupid where they can can't understand anything but shorter messages spread faster. This action plan is written in 4th-grade English as a good example to use. If you are still confused, use this.](http://gunning-fog-index.com/))


* **Get The 'Normies' Angry and Direct That Anger To Take Action**: Get outside of your circle of friends who are tech-savvy already. Talk to people who are not always online all the time, too or more interested in mainstream news. Keep the conversation simple, **""Would you pay more for the same Internet""**


* **Get The 'Normies' Associated:** Only tech-savvy people seem to be freaking out about this. We need to drive a larger controversy where normal people have to contact the ""normies"" in their lives about the Internet.


* **Understand that the News Had Ignored Us Before**: The mainstream news is compromised by the ISP's. You have to spread the news in our playground: the Internet. We know the social media platforms like the back of our hand. We can abuse the spread of news about net neutrality.


* **Get The News To Fight Us, FAST:** Using controversy is the best way to make this happen. I am aware that Ajit Pai is the pawn but driving focus to his actions is the key to getting some controversy. He has plenty of reasons to go about, too.


* **Partner Up with Social Media 'Microphones:** Leverage the voices with those who have larger audiences than you. Their words will reach more people than yours ever could. Contact YouTubers, podcasters, social media personalities about net neutrality and how it affects them.


* **Contact Businesses To Do Surprise Sales, Program for Net Neutrality**: Business have stake in having unlimited customer reach and not having to deal with unpredictable overhead.


* **Contact YouTubers to Talk About Net Neutrality**: Contact YouTubers about net neutrality and ask them to do a video about net neutrality. **Be sure to have your sources ready so that they can easily talk about the net neutrality.**


* **THE ONLY CTA is Calling Senators and Representatives**: The most important thing is getting people to call their Senators and their Representatives right away. This is the only action that needs to be taken.

__________________________________

**TOO LONG/DIDN'T READ**: This is the (somewhat) short version. I do want the whole thing to be read but if you could, you can read just this and read few sections at a time.

**SUGGESTED TACTICS**
 
* **Use branded content **(mainstream shows/movies that everyone watches)** to bring awareness:** Use branded mainstream media content that everyone already knows as memes or videos. They spread faster and they get people excited about net neutrality. Make sure that you use that meme to direct people to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Abuse Ajit Pai's Mean Tweets video:** Create a short meme video where you can upload on Facebook. Use white banner bars over this video about Ajit Pai doing a Mean Tweets video. **Top BANNER: ""AJIT PAI WANTS TO MAKE YOU PAY MORE FOR THE INTERNET"" BOTTOM BANNER: ""DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATORS and YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.**


* **Most importantly, use CTA in messages: Call Senate and Representatives**: The most thing about to stress out is to use media to convert your audience into going to [Battle for the Net.](https://battleforthenet.com) This is very important. The conversion drives the traffic to the right Senators and the Representatives.


* **Bring relevance to net neutrality in a creative way:**  Use popular media like **The Office, The Simpsons, Final Fantasy VII, Super Mario Bros., and other **POPULAR MEDIA** to spread the message across the social media networks.


* **Use short facts about FFC and net neutrality. Use 4th grade-level English.** Keep the language simple and straight-to-the-point. There is a reason why Ajit Pai keeps saying, ""Take the Internet out of the hands of bueracrats and into entrepreneurs and engineers. Our sound bite is ""**NET NEUTRALITY IS FREE SPEECH**"". It's simple, proven, and hard to debate against.


* **Use humor, entertainment, suspense, sex appeal to get people intrigued and interesting.** People are busy so using net neutrality in a way gets people excited and funny. **What if you are talentless?** Share another video if someone who is talented! [This video is a great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JucFpDhuF98)


* **Contact businesses and content creators**: Businesses and content creators have interest in keeping net neutrality alive. You can contact them about net neutrality and make the research phase the most easiest phase when you compile the evidence that they need to look through. **Bonus points if you can summarize each source you give to them.**


* **Educate yourself**: Understand the history behind ISP's. It's a confusing history but you have to do your research so you can explain to the next person why you think net neutrality is proven.


* **To maximize spread, upload your content in the early morning**: I have been testing this out to some great results. Keep uploading (and re-uploading the same content) in the early morning. I don't know why exactly but it spreads faster this way.

**ACTION PLAN:**
 
* **Put down the Shotgun, Use Your Rifle**: It's time to stay aiming at anything that moves and being reactive. We need to be proactive. Calling Senators and Representatives do help but we need to aim our rifles at the general public. Get them to call their Senators and their Representatives.


* **Aim at the Right Targets**: The right targets are getting the average person motivated to call the Senators and their Representatives.


* **Use the Call-to-Action To Leverage Against the FCC**: The only action that we ask our audience to do is to contact their Senators and their Representatives. [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Use Researchers who Know Everything about Net Neutrality**: Team up with researchers who understand net neutrality thoroughly! Use them as a reference to understand all about net neutrality.


* **Spark Some Controversy**: It's still key that we get on the news about this. Spread Ajit Pai about net neutrality. Not everyone knows how important net neutrality is to them. So, reaching out beyond just our circles is **critical**.


* **Use Condensed Messages**: Keep your messages engaging, short, straight-to-the-point when speaking about net neutrality.


* **Use Mainstream Media**: Use **Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Mr. Robot, Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons, Futurama, Star Wars, Parks and Recreation, Spongebob Squarepants**,  and other **POPULAR** media to spread your messages about net neutrality. It spreads faster and farther. **ALWAYS put the call-to-action in there.** Always, always direct people into calling their Senators and their Representative - especially if they are Republican.

* **LEVERAGE AJIT PAI AGAINST HIMSELF**: The best way that you convert the bystander to your side is to convince them that Ajit Pai hates America and currently lying to the American people now. [This Mean Tweets video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) should do the trick. 

* **Pictures and Videos Spread More**: Use pictures and short videos to spread news about net neutrality.

**READ THE BLUEPRINT AS A GUIDELINE:**

* [I have  also written a blueprint on how to **BEST GO ABOUT THIS**.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7hffx7/blueprint_to_save_net_neutrality/)

I have heard about 1% of the songs on these playlists I'm generating but the rest of the songs are absolutely perfect. The algorithms for this feature seem better at predicting music taste than the discover playlist.

I recommend listening on Spotify. The other sites are auto-synced with it but don't convert all songs.

&#x200B;

These playlists were meant to include the classics and my personal favorites for each genre. I also tried to make a fun cover thumbnail for each one.

&#x200B;

So, if you want to get into new genres, or listen to some great tracks of a genre you already enjoy, please check it out! These are still being updated from time to time and a few more playlists might be added in the future. Suggestions are always welcome!",Entertainment
listentothis,/r/ListenToThis presents the Best Of overlooked music from 2017,"Welcome to the /r/ListenToThis Best Of 2017!

Here there are no scores, no judgments, and no opinions - just obscure music shared by redditors, collected and arranged for you over the course of several months by our dedicated mod team. This list is meant to complement other best of lists on the internet, many of which are linked in the sticky comment below for further discovery.

Set #1 includes everything - the best of the best tracks and a corresponding all-inclusive album playlist.  
The other sets are the same content, broken up into genre groups so you can listen according to your tastes. There is a sampler (1 track per album) and a full-album (every track from every album) playlist for each group. We’ve also included a listing of the albums by set in this post as not everything is available on Spotify, Tidal, etc. We tried to prefer an artist’s Bandcamp or Soundcloud, but if nothing else was available, you may see Youtube, Spotify, and iTunes links. The final count this year is 226 artists out of more than a thousand submissions.

What did we miss? Share your favorites in the comments… and [happy listening.](http://i.imgur.com/RYklpFO.gifv).

listentothis,"[discussion] can we maybe change the name of this sub to something like “we, the automods, regret to inform you that we’ve found a fifth new reason we won’t allow you to post that video you really like here. Hahaha maybe that sixth time....”","TLDR: maybe lets pump the brakes on the auto mods and allow some human bending of the strict rules to allow people to share that new (to them) goosebump-raising music they just found! Oh and In Flames - Paralyzed is a pretty sweet song. 



I want to like this sub!  I really do!  But you may as well bring an attorney with you to read the posting rules and hire an analytical firm to survey the interwebs to see if that cool new band you want to share with people satisfies the STRICT posting guidelines here. 

I love my rock, metal and everything in between, and have combed through what’s available pretty well after as many decades as I’ve been around. When I find a new band that sends the chills, it’s a rare thing!  I want to believe this sub is a place you can do that but man, it’s just not. 

Since last night and into this morning I’ve tried posting  (from mobile) the same video at least four times: In Flames - Paralyzed. A band I’ve never heard of until last week and have really come to enjoy!  Trying to share it with everyone here, I found every excuse not to from the auto mods that immediately shot down each try: improper formatting, linked to the wrong website, linked to a mobile website, oh it seems that In Flames has 1,205,043 last.fm listeners which places it over our max. Combine these attempts with an auto 10-minute cooldown for posting, and this is an hour trying to share a video. Maybe we’ve found why this sub is so dead. 

Edit: props to the mods for showing up and engaging in some dialogue!  ",Entertainment

I'll end up just shuffling my ""song"" option instead of searching for new stuff. How do I branch out, with more stuff like this? Being less 'safe' with my musical enterprises and just finding more?

It's a social music sharing type site with user created rooms for different genres.","I've been able to discover so much new music through [JQBX.fm](https://www.jqbx.fm/). And make some good new music nerd friends as well. It's very similar to turntable.fm from a few years ago. Full disclosure - I am a mod of r/jqbx and have been on the site for a while but have no other affiliation. I just love it and want to spread the word.

Log in, pick a room. Jump on deck and share your tunes when it's your turn.",Entertainment
listentothis,[Discussion] Is everything okay?,"This isn't to come off as a complaint because it isn't but rather a general inquiry of concern. Mod team, everything okay? It just seems like things are grinding to a slow grind around here. The front page bar still has a ""Top 50 of November"" on it, there hasn't been a best of 2016 even though there were plenty of submissions, and it just seems generally like the sub is in some sort of rut. 

Do you guys need help? I reached out two months ago and got a response but then it went dead. If you guys need help, please tell us. I'm sure there are plenty of us that would love to help you guys get stuff done.

Hopefully I don't come off like I'm complaining. I'm just very grateful for this sub and don't want it to fall off the radar.

EDIT: Message from mod /u/astarkey12

You're absolutely right. The sub has gotten stagnant, and the mods have had trouble compiling Best Of this year due to IRL obligations. We do need help, so if you'd like to contribute specifically to Best Of, reply to this comment. If you are interested in full moderator duties, [please click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ISM4TMVgaNMrwLwwDQol-Os3Z6U7awJCvxWQvyzBXOyDLg/viewform) to apply after responding to this comment.
I take full responsibility and apologize for the delay because my plans to step down after 4 years running the sub are probably hurting motivation. This will be my last Best Of sadly.",Entertainment
listentothis,Official /r/ListenToThis Best Of 2015 - 600+ hours of the best overlooked music from the last year,"Welcome!

Albums were collected from users throughout hundreds of music subs, cleaned up and presented with streaming links and playlists. There are no scores, no judgments, and no opinions - just obscure music shared and curated by other reddit users then collected and arranged for you over the course of two months by our dedicated mod team. This list is meant to complement other bestof lists on the internet, many of which are linked in the sticky comment below for further discovery. Albums are broken up into groups. There are playlists for each group, and a Master playlist with one track from each album so you can drink it all in at once.

It turned out to be an impossible task, as over 600 albums were released each month, for a total of more than 7500 new albums over the course of the year.  I did still manage to listen to over 850 albums, and kept track of my favorites in Google Sheets(If anyone is interested, you can see my top 500 albums in order [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17S9wqm7WzsxkNS6NukEJjX_QnUkdMp7p_HkdwTUdhd0/edit?usp=sharing).)  I spent about 20 hours every week listening to new music, and discovered hundreds of new artists I’d never heard of.

I was surprised how many amazing albums came out this year (and presumably every year) that no one seems to talk about.  I wanted to share a few albums that I felt were sadly overlooked.  These aren’t my top 25 albums, these are just 25 great albums that I want to spread to a wider audience.  Hopefully some of them can get the recognition they deserve!

**1. Ripe - [*Joy in the Wild Unknown*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5zENm1Gr6BM9mmYkjyN43K) (Released 4/6/18, Massachusetts, US)**

This was easily my favorite album of the year from the moment I heard it.  It’s a light, fun album with straightforward lyrics and catchy grooves.  Ripe incorporates rock, funk, soul, and pop into their timeless sound.  They’re as accessible as any big name pop rock group, but without the same cliches.  I could see them blowing the roof off a festival if they got the chance, but blowing the roof off a dive bar wouldn’t be any less fun to see.  If you only listen to one new artist from this list, please listen to Ripe!

Standout Tracks:  Little Lighter, Flipside, Young Tom Rose, Pedro

**2. Black Mirrors - [*Look Into the Black Mirror*](https://open.spotify.com/album/35nVfpeFAajzhRHEu4FaZx)  (Released 8/31/18, Belgium)**

Of all the incredible female-fronted rock bands to release great albums this year, Black Mirrors’ debut was my favorite.  Their music draws tons of influence from the blues and garage rock of the late 60s, as well as its revival in the early 00s, without attempting to replicate either directly.  They don’t stick to a single style throughout, but the sound they create is uniquely their own.  If you like the *idea* of Greta Van Fleet, but ultimately think they’re too unoriginal, give Black Mirrors a try instead.

Standout Tracks: Funky Queen, Günther Kimmich, Till the Land Wind Blows

**3. Fantastic Negrito - [*Please Don’t Be Dead*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0w1G67UUZQzMHsqO9cAZ06) (Released 6/15/18, California, US)**

His first album already won him a Grammy, and this album has been nominated for another, yet for some reason, few people I’ve met have heard of Fantastic Negrito.  If you’re one of those people, that should change.  His contemporary treatment of a classic blues and soul sound is a bit more raw, and honestly more creative, than most of his contemporaries.  The songs on *Please Don’t Be Dead* are all over the place, yet the album still holds together as an impressive and cohesive work with lots of relistenability.

Standout Tracks: Plastic Hamburgers, A Boy Named Andrew, The Duffler

**4. Rhye - [*Blood*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yoGOJsTjU7w2amKcUUX7S) (Released 2/2/18, Canada)**

It’s a simple album, but beautiful in its simplicity.  The smooth electronic melodies set a perfect backdrop for smokey vocals delivered in a style reminiscent of early XX.  Relaxing enough to serve as background music but also interesting enough for a closer listen, *Blood* was my favorite album of the year to fall beneath the massive “electronic” umbrella of music.

Standout Tracks: Taste, Please, Blood Knows

**5. Emma Ruth Rundle - [*On Dark Horses*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1vcWwbIr1mePnssmxYvmGH) (Released 9/14/18, Kentucky, US)**

*On Dark Horses* is actually pretty dark, musically and thematically.  Rundle’s vocals sound like they would fit with acoustic guitars and other traditional folk instruments, but she instead opts for a relentlessly heavy post rock atmosphere.  Her emotional delivery, combined with swirling layers of electric guitars and percussion, make this a powerful album.

Standout Tracks: Darkhorse, Races, Light Song

**6. Red Lama - [*Motions*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0U0UFLV9EP11KYBZuIeLfk) (Released 2/23/18, Denmark)**

The psychedelic prog rock on *Motions* is more subtle than the musical excess of the early 70s, though still just as compelling for fans of the classics.  The songs play out through steady grooves rather than grand fanfares, and the vocals lack the soaring falsettos and epic lyrics that characterize a lot of classic prog rock.  But the band is just as tight, and extremely talented.  This album would be excellent paired with a tab of acid.

Standout Tracks: Awakening feat. Bjonko, Post Optimism, Fular

**7. Stonefield - [*Far From Earth*](https://open.spotify.com/album/7zxPsrcn1bbLrGgzUQo3qg) (Released 4/13/18, Australia)**

Another of the great female rock groups of the decade, Stonefield is already on their third album, but lack the recognition they deserve.  They’re talented musicians with strong vocals, exceptional songwriting, a classic psychedelic sound, and the type of chemistry that only a band of four siblings can achieve.  *Far From Earth* encompasses a dynamic range of musical stylings and influences, and Stonefield kills it on every song.  They sound like a band that shares many common musical influences with Jack Black, but (no disrespect to Jables) actually have the talent to make it work without resorting to a comedy routine.

Standout Tracks: Far From the Earth, Visions, Through the Storm

**8. Jean-Michel Blais - [*Dans ma main*](https://open.spotify.com/album/7kCt6SHmlogqzWmkjKSW6v) (Released 5/11/18, Canada)**

Jean-Michel Blais is already a critically acclaimed composer, and this album was nominated for the 2018 Polaris prize.  But being a mostly instrumental piano album, it’s not the kind of thing you’re likely to hear on the radio.  So if you haven’t heard this album, here’s my suggestion:  Draw a bath, get cozy in bed, or however you do.  Turn off the lights, put this album on, and just listen to it beginning to end.  It’s really an experience. 

Standout Tracks: Roses, Dans ma main, Igloo

**9. Earthless - [*Black Heaven*](https://open.spotify.com/album/3hjUqSi9QLBNyjLVVkgRMN) (Released 3/16/18, California, US)**

Earthless have been turning out solid psychedelic hard rock albums for over a decade, though until now their work has been largely instrumental.  Their first album to feature vocals throughout is a masterpiece, partially because they obviously don’t need a singer to create great music.  You can tell that the vocals on this album were written with intention, not to be highlighted in their own right, but to complement the instrumentals.  Though the band themselves would probably disagree, adding bluesy vocals reminiscent of Deep Purple or Motorhead finally makes the band sound complete.

Standout Tracks: Electric Flame, Black Heaven, Sudden End

**10. Circles Around the Sun - [*Let It Wander*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6X1tor4uATikNtGxWkHuEA) (Released 8/17/18, US)**

Obviously I have a thing for psychedelic jams, but this album is different in that it draws influence more heavily from jazz than from rock.  While each song is a journey and experience in its own right, the album is also accessible enough to put on in the background without turning too many heads.  The songs on this album are pretty long, but never sound pretentious or self-gratifying.  It’s easy enough to get lost in this album that by the time it’s done you haven’t even realized the time has passed, and you might be tempted to just play it on repeat.

Standout Tracks: Immovable Object, Halicarnassus, Electric Chair (Don’t Sit There)

**11. LAUREL - [*Dogviolet*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6CIanwE77USA9tyvHJ5TZF) (Released 8/24/18, England, UK)**

Laurel’s music sounds like it could have been written for pop radio, but the songs are generally more understanded and lack any grandeur.  The Florence Welch-like richness of her voice carries the album with its emotional delivery, but the synth-heavy instrumental arrangements add a lot to each song as well.  Fans of London Grammar will probably enjoy this album.

Standout Tracks: Life Worth Living, Adored, Sun King

**12. The Blue Stones - [*Black Holes*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1Mvvk2DD6PavBfW6p0mKlP) (Released 10/26/18, Canada)**

First there were the White Stripes, then the Black Keys.  The Blue Stones could easily complete the trifecta.  They tend to be a bit heavier than either of the former, but no less catchy or groovy.  *Black Holes* is surprisingly consistent for a debut album.  There’s plenty of room for growth, but it sets a high standard for future releases to live up to.

Standout Tracks: The Drop, Black Holes (Solid Ground), Be My Fire

**13. Novo Amor - [*Birthplace*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0tWckYjFI6ioZptLr42J3p) (Released 10/19/18, Wales, UK)**

In a lot of ways, Novo Amor sounds like he’s trying to be the next Bon Iver.  Both artists employ a light and airy falsetto, and both experiment by pushing the boundaries of indie folk.  But Novo Amor’s music is different and unique enough to recognize that he’s got plenty of talent in his own right.  *Birthplace* showcases a broad spectrum of emotions, with plenty of interesting instrumental arrangements that go beyond the indie folk cliche of acoustic strings.

Standout Tracks: Birthplace, Utican, Seneca

**14. Valley Maker - [*Rhododendron*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2k9f0ldzWGa8lNOn6MAlgu) (Released 10/12/18, Washington, US)**

There are a lot of layers to *Rhododendron*.  The songs have detailed instrumental arrangements, poetic and reflective lyrics, hauntingly beautiful vocal harmonies, and melodies that get stuck in your head (in a good way).  It’s frank and bare, which makes it instantly relatable.  If indie folk is your jam, you might find this among your favorite albums of the year.

Standout Tracks: Light on the Ground, Rise Up, Wonder

**15. Fewjar - [*Gamma*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6UZq4a4GQUOhfZJm4aJDgJ) (Released 5/25/18, Germany)**

On the surface, *Gamma* is a damn good synthpop album.  On a deeper level, it’s still a good synthpop album, but with a lot of musical depth.  Fewjar incorporate a lot of diverse stylistic influences that make this a solid album beyond just the danceable songs.  Like all good pop albums, it has darker and more introspective moments as well.  The album shifts tone frequently, but never loses momentum.

Standout Tracks: Skeleton, Gamma, Treasure

**16. Demonauta - [*Temaukel, the Spirit Before Time*](https://open.spotify.com/album/22cRFqZ19GIMVBgw6yaNNu) (Released 8/13/18, Chile)**

Demonauta is like a psychedelic biker gang of swamp monsters travelling through time and space to bring you the crunchiest, bluesiest metal this side of Hell.  If you like dropping acid and fighting demons with alien weaponry, this album could be your personal soundtrack.  They may not have the most original sound, but they have an abundance of talent with which to pull it off.

Standout Tracks: Sons of Black Sun, Blues para Angela Loij, Psilocybeat

**17. Joey Pecoraro - [*Music for Happiness*](https://open.spotify.com/album/3jpzzNUvdVOr4ZleOJD6wd) (Released 4/6/18, Michigan, US)**

*Music for Happiness* sounds like Joey Pecoraro went into a coma in 1945, woke up 70 years later in a recording studio full of computers, and immediately started making music.  The album is full of samples and sound bytes that conjure images of a smokey lounge in interwar Europe.  It’s the perfect combination of downtempo and jazz.  If you chill out to Tycho, Emancipator, Little People, and Nujabes, add Joey Pecoraro to your playlists.

Standout Tracks: Don’t Be a Fool, I Think I Am Falling in Love, Play It Again

**18. PEALS - [*PEALS*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2rEZGPHDWloJouVykLPv8H) (Released 5/11/18, Germany)**

If you fear the death of rock music; if you hate Imagine Dragons; if you grew up on rock radio in the 90s and 00s - check out PEALS.  They play straightforward rock music with no pop production gimmicks.  They’re not making huge strides in musical innovation by any means, but their songs are catchy and memorable.  Compared to other album releases this year, PEALS stands out as almost a novelty for their basic guitar-bass-drums approach to alternative rock.

Standout Tracks: Radiation Safe, The Tenant, The Salvation and the Power

**19. Say Lou Lou - [*Immortelle*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1J8qyiuSQ0LvDELnkvbEje) (Released 10/26/18, Australia/Sweden)**

These are the daughters of Steve Kilbey, lead singer of the Church, but even if you aren’t a fan of the Church you should give Say Lou Lou a chance.  Their style is similar to the indie bands of the 00s - Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Santigold, Tegan & Sara, etc.  You can hear the influence of the 80s on this album, but also a ton of originality.  Even their cover of *Under the Milky Way* sounds completely different, though it does make me wonder if the family sang this together in the car Step Brothers style when they were kids.

Standout Tracks: Ana, All Love to Me, Under the Milky Way

**20. Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs - [*King of Cowards*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ntUXL8IssCZ2UFlzbntlS) (Released 9/28/18, England, UK)**

This album is heavy as fuck.  I realize it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea.  But if your cup of tea is actually a cup of whiskey because you’re not a punk ass bitch, you should listen to Pigs x7, if for no other reason than because of the awesome band name.  But also because it’s one of the best metal albums released this year.

Standout Tracks: GNT, Thumbsucker, Cake of Light

**21. Kadhja Bonet - [*Childqueen*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1rUI6iwxz81yEgS7POrqlO) (Released 6/8/18, California, US)**

This album is weird and artsy, but the more I listen to it the more I like it for that very reason.  Kadhja Bonet obviously has more talent in her pinky toe than I have in my whole body.  She flawlessly combines musical styles to create a brand new sound that draws equally on psychedelic and R&B, but with a healthy pinch of whatever else she feels like.  Each song is a unique experience, which makes the whole album infinitely relistenable.

Standout Tracks: Delphine, Wings, Mother Maybe

**22. Bombino - [*Deran*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Gm3Wy05MApR47NZmRo1DW) (Released 5/18/18, Nigeria)**

A great singer-songwriter is a great singer-songwriter, even if they don’t speak your language.  He’s toured around the world and released several albums before this, but Bombino still doesn’t get the sort of mainstream attention he deserves.  If you like expanding your musical pallet, even if you don’t speak Tamasheq, you should give this album a listen (and maybe look up the lyrics).  It’s got enough elements of blues, rock, and folk to be accessible even if you typically prefer western music styles.

Standout Tracks: Imajghane, Tehigren, Tenesse

**23. Le Trio Joubran - [*The Long March*](https://open.spotify.com/album/39gHqJhxFtOKIhPWUhrPp6) (Released 10/12/18, Israel)**

I never imagined I would love Palestinian oud music until I heard this album.  I had to immediately go listen to Le Trio Joubran’s entire back catalog.  They’re mostly instrumental, and the few vocals are in a language I can’t understand, but this music just moves me on a whole other level.  It’s expressive, emotional, and performed with expert precision.  If you don’t frequently listen to non-western music, this is worth a listen or twelve.

Standout Tracks: The Long March, The Hanging Moon, Our Final Songs

**24. Rainbow Kitten Surprise - [*How To: Friend, Love, Freefall*](https://open.spotify.com/album/7vXiklrUeffx5o2F8VYwm3) (Released 4/6/18, North Carolina, US)**

It seems like Rainbow Kitten Surprise is starting to gain some traction, but apparently aren’t significant enough to merit a Wikipedia page yet, and I’d like to see that change.  Not only was this among my favorite albums of the year; not only did I play Fever Pitch on repeat all summer, but this was the best concert I saw in 2018 as well.  This band absolutely kills it in every aspect - lyrics, songwriting, musicianship, and onstage theatrics.  It’s hard to classify their style, as they effortlessly jump from folk to hip hop to rock within a single song, but there’s almost nothing to dislike about this band.

Standout Tracks: Fever Pitch, It’s Called: Freefall, Hide

**25. courtship. - [*Denial in Paradise*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6gL2CfGVp7decHEo4vdzyY) (Released 5/11/18, California, US)**

There’s a soft spot in my heart for bouncy, overproduced indie pop.  It can be cheesy and cliche, but when it’s done right, nothing puts me in a better mood.  Courtship. generally doesn’t stray far from their comfort zone, but they have a knack for catchy hooks, and in this case that’s enough.  It’s a fun, summery album that doesn’t really make you think or challenge you as a listener.  Not every album needs to be Dark Side of the Moon.

Standout Tracks: Nice Guy, Warm Waters, Bad Fun

listentothis,[Discussion] This subreddit has a major popularity problem,"When I first joined r/listentothis this roughly 5 years ago, it seemed like a great place to check out/share some lesser-known artists that deserve to be discovered.  Through the years, I've discovered some of my favorite artists through this subreddit, like Starcadian, Little Brutes, and illuminati hotties.  And in theory the subreddit sounds like a great idea - it can really help open up some artists to the mainstream.

But this subreddit has a major problem with its popularity limits.  The problem isn't that they're too strict, but rather that they're almost never enforced.  Don't believe me?  Take a look at [the current front page of the subreddit](https://i.imgur.com/Om8V8Pj.png).  Out of the 8 top posts on hot currently, 4 of them, including each of the top 3, all exceed the popularity limits of the subreddit, with another not meeting the repost limits (there were two Colony House songs posted 5 hours apart from each other) and yet another not meeting the formatting guidelines (this one isn't as big, but it's still worth bringing up as I have recently seen more and more posts breaking from the required format).  The fact that an Ozzy Osbourne and Elton John song is getting upvoted on this subreddit shows that this subreddit has reached the point where it's abandoned its goal of becoming a place to share undiscovered artists and becoming nothing more than an r/music clone.  And it's not like these submissions above *just barely* pass the popularity limits - the Teenage Kicks video has 4.5M views on YouTube, the Vitas song has almost 6M views, and Aurora Sunrise has over 3M, all of which are well above the requirements of the subreddit.  And digging deeper into the subreddit, you can see songs in new from SYML (WELL above the popularity limits on Spotify) and Rage Against the Machine.  

When you combine a subreddit that requires strict moderation with the fact that [there hasn't been a human mod added in over a year on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/about/moderators), it results in a mess of a subreddit that doesn't serve its purpose and results in newcomers who don't understand the purpose of the subreddit and treat it like another r/music.  Anyways, I just needed to get this rant off of my chest and hopefully the moderators will do something about this issue, as I've noticed it getting worse over the past couple of weeks.",Entertainment

listentothis,"[Discussion] So, when are we actually going to stop being an underground form of /r/music and start being /r/listentothis?","This was one of my favourite subreddit ideas, a subreddit where criminally underrated or unknown music is given an opportunity to attract enough new listeners to get a boost in the music scene, a subreddit where the only wrong submission is one that is already popular. But now it's essentially just become ""Upvote the underground music you already know and comment how much you love this artist"". If you go to any post on the frontpage of this sub, the comments are nothing but ""I already know and love this artist!"". Rarely ***ever*** are comments what they primarily should be, and that's discussion about the music that they are hearing for the first time.

And when new submissions come in, the vast majority of the time they get either downvoted or just a few upvotes; often because people aren't actually doing what this sub was intended for, and that's LISTENING. 

When you tell a friend ""Oh, hey, you've *gotta* listen to this!"" and turn on the song, if they say ""I already know this song"", are you showing them a song? No, because they've already been shown that song. This sub is not supposed to be /r/howmanypeopleknowthis.

It feels like a bastardization of what we should be doing. And this is OUR fault, not the mods.  

What we should be doing is:

- LISTENING to new submissions of artists you have not heard of before

- UPVOTING the song you have just discovered if you think other people will like it

- DISCUSSING your first impressions and thoughts on the song or artist you have just been exposed to

- SUBMITTING artists that deserve more attention instead of submitting somewhat-known artists that you think will get you the most upvotes based on recognition

- If you see a song or an artist you already know, you DON'T UPVOTE. It becomes an underground popularity contest. Commenting that you know and like the artist/song is fine, and might actually encourage more people to give it a shot; but when you start to upvote based solely on recognition, the subreddit stops being what it is intended to be, and that is giving NEW recognition to the unrecognized. 

- Under no circumstances should you DOWNVOTE unless a post is spam or trolling. There is absolutely no reason to. The sidebar explicitly states that ""This is not a place to bury music you don't like."" Music is subjective, and there will always be someone that wants to hear the song you might not like. By downvoting a song, artist, or genre you don't like, you are preventing listeners from possibly finding their new favourite artist.

I hope this post doesn't come off douchey, but it's been really bugging me lately that we're becoming exactly what we tend to hate about /r/music, and that's the popularity contests and circlejerking. I wish people utilized this wonderful idea for a sub; because if it was functioning how it should, we would seriously help more artists that are stuck in obscurity find more of an audience.",Entertainment

#[I’m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I’m running for US Senate in West Virginia.](http://imgur.com/U9Jtsbx)

---

Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.

---

###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. 

---

“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.

Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.

A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.

Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed
first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.

The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.

It’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to
inherit the struggles that we have had to endure. 

I’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate.

4:14 PM ET: we're back! gonna knock out some more questions until I have to dip. Appreciate all the interest! Sorry he sometimes misunderstands some questions aha.

With a lot of these I'll ask him and he says 'let me think about that a bit' and I'll circle back and I guess he hasn't finished thinking about them - so sorry for those still waiting! lol

5:05 PM ET: So he's starting to fall asleep as I ask him questions, so I think we're gonna call it a day aha. He's in rehab for a broken hip right now, and a bit forgetful and confused at times, so hopefully that will give some explanation to some of the stranger answers he's said. Thank you so much for everyone who asked things and commented and told stories and thanked him, he is just so pleased!!! I'll go through this as I'm able and answer what I can from my perspective.

He gets tired pretty quickly, and tends to say ""I need to think about that"" for things that aren't direct (broad questions like ""meaning of life"" and such), so for further questions I would encourage more specific questions.

While we're here and this has so much visibility (wow), I've gotta put this out there, cause I'd really love to have the opportunity to live as long as my grandpa has: WE NEED CLIMATE ACTION!!! We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it's been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that.

IAmA,"I am a 92 year old German born Jew who grew up in the Hitler youth and was forced to fight in WW2 in the German anti-tank division. I deserted and became a POW in a British camp and eventually moved to Canada in 1955. Just recently, I published a memoir of my life. AMA","I was born in 1927 in Herne, Germany. To quote from my memoir, ""I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family."" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.

Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.

When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.

In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.

My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.

My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\_1\_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4)

\*\*\* EDIT 1\*\*\*

Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.

Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\*

Robert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:

I’d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, “FEARLESS” “A Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.” I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler’s military. I was one of them.",
IAmA,"We are firefighters and net neutrality experts. Verizon was caught throttling the Santa Clara Fire Department's unlimited Internet connection during one of California’s biggest wildfires. We're here to answer your questions about it, or net neutrality in general, so ask us anything!","Hey Reddit,

This summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.

This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.

To push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** 

In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.

Who we are:

* Adam Cosner (California Professional Firefighters) - /u/AdamCosner
* Laila Abdelaziz (Campaigner at Fight for the Future) - /u/labdel

No matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.

UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department.

IAmA,I'm an ex-Scientologist who was trafficked for labor by Scientology from ages 15 - 18. I reported it to the FBI and they did nothing. AMA [Trigger Warning],"My name is [Derek Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/user/dbloch7986). 

I am not the typical ""high-ranking"" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). [Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.](https://truepic.com/gx54exce) 

FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.

[First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists.](http://www.forum.exscn.net/threads/a-brief-summary-of-my-time-inside.26189/#post656666) It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.

After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a >!""pussy""!< for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a >!""faggot""!<. >!{Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}!<

[Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.](https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/16/scientology-disconnection-and-homophobia-derek-blochs-story/)

>!(Ef yoo dad.)!<

[I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1328-5-disturbing-things-i-learned-in-scientologys-space-navy.html)

I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. [Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/27/derek-bloch-on-fighting-scientology-disconnection-in-an-unaired-tv-series-2/)

Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.

*On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!*

On this season, I am sitting down (virtually) with some of the biggest names in entertainment, including Dame Judi Dench, Jim Parsons, Stacey Abrams, Elisabeth Moss and more. This is following an incredibly fun first season where I spoke with the likes of John Hamm, Whoopi Goldberg and James Corden. Each episode gives you an inside look at these stars’ lives, packed with revealing conversation, surprise stories and, of course, lots of laughs! I’m looking forward to sharing these with you.

Episode one is live today! Listen to it on [Apple Podcasts](https://apple.co/davidtennant).

#[Hi, I’m Lissa Lucas!](https://i.imgur.com/nE4sjxB.jpg)

Some people have always wanted to go into politics. _Not me._ I’d rather be hiking with my dog, to be perfectly frank. Or gardening… or making jam.

“Don’t MAKE me come down there!” That’s what it feels like—like we have to deal with misbehaving kids in the backseat of a car. “I WILL turn this state around!”

Someone has to, right?

#Evidently we can’t leave governance to those who want to do it as a career. Sometimes regular people have to step in and demand we work on issues that will help people rather than engage in party politics. We need more public servants, and fewer politicians.

Since my last AMA, I’ve written a book called [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-new-climate-book-is-finally-here?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE). There’s been exciting progress in the more than 15 years that I’ve been learning about energy and climate change. What we need now is a plan that turns all this momentum into practical steps to achieve our big goals.

My book lays out exactly what that plan could look like. I’ve also created an organization called [Breakthrough Energy](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) to accelerate innovation at every step and push for policies that will speed up the clean energy transition.

When I wasn’t working on my book, I spent a lot time over the last year working with my colleagues at the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/our-story) and around the world on [ways to stop COVID-19](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-funding-additional-250-million-suzman). The scientific advances made in the last year are stunning, but so far we've fallen short on the vision of equitable access to vaccines for people in low-and middle-income countries. As we start the recovery from COVID-19, we need to take the hard-earned lessons from this tragedy and make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic.

I’ve already [answered a few questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9dwCfnzQr4) about two really important numbers. You can ask me some more about climate change, COVID-19, or anything else.

Today a diverse coalition of interested parties including the ACLU, Amazon, Etsy, Mozilla, Kickstarter, and many others came together to sound the alarm about the Federal Communications Commission’s attack on net neutrality.
A free and open internet is vital for our democracy and for our daily lives. But the FCC is considering a proposal that threatens net neutrality — and therefore the internet as we know it.

“Network neutrality” is based on a simple premise: that the company that provides your Internet connection can't interfere with how you communicate over that connection. An Internet carrier’s job is to deliver data from its origin to its destination — not to block, slow down, or de-prioritize information because they don't like its content.

He was a character on The West Wing.  Played by Oliver Platt?  He was in like 8 episodes?  It doesn't matter.
 
My second cookbook, The Binging with Babish companion cookbook, hits shelves and slides into your DM's (domestic mail's) today - it's got the first hundred recipes from the show, good and bad, terrible and wonderful, for your consideration and recreation.  I started out posting pretty pictures of my various dinners to /r/food, and eventually had the idea to make what I called a ""moving-picture"" (I've since learned that this is called a video) of my food, and share it on this community.  This was the first episode of Binging with Babish, the show where I recreate foods from movies and television.  Three and a half years later, and I'm making all different kinds of shows, getting to be a guest on Hot Ones (shout out /u/seanseaevans), buying my brother his dream car, opening a brewpub in Brooklyn, and dropping my second cookbook.  I've said this many times before, but I owe my career and wonderful new life to the Reddit community, who helped spread the word about my show in /r/videos, /r/cooking, and /r/food.  My channel is one of the countless examples of how content creation and creativity are being slowly democratized, and how almost anyone, anywhere, with little more than a camera and an internet connection, can potentially have their voice heard by millions.

IAmA,I'm a Florida reporter who covers Scientology. I just revealed a series of mysterious land deals that give the church control of a mid-sized city’s downtown. AMA.,"Hello Reddit, I'm Tracey McManus. For the last four years, I've reported on the Church of Scientology for the Tampa Bay Times.
 
For the last six months, I've been investigating a spate of real estate purchases in downtown Clearwater, Fla. The Church of Scientology and companies run by its members have spent $103 million since 2017 buying about 100 properties. They now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront. We built a [graphic demonstrating just how little is left](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/).
 
Downtown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination. Yet downtown is dotted with empty storefronts. The purchases took off as the city was developing a $64 million plan to turn the area around. We don’t know whether these purchases will help the city’s goal.
 
The church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control. I recap the [whole history here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/scientologys-40-years-of-conflict-with-the-city-of-clearwater-recapped/).
 
In April 2017, the city snubbed Scientology Leader David Miscavige. Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.
 
The church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as “mindless robots.” But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church’s involvement.
 
For more, [read the investigation here.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/) We also published a story on what [city council members think.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/what-clearwaters-city-council-thinks-about-scientologys-downtown-takeover/)

We have to keep the pressure on.
------------
Update 2: That's a wrap! Thanks for your questions and for your help in the fight to rein in government spying powers.
------------

A mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it.  Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law. 
 
Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.

The surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.
 
Some in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse. We need to make clear to our lawmakers that we’re expecting them to rein government’s worst and most harmful spying powers.

EDIT: Sorry for the clumsy title, I used the word protest 4 times in the same sentence oops

EDIT 2: I'm gonna go ahead and eat dinner, Ill be back to answering questions in an hour or so (7:42 PM HK time), thanks for all the questions so far guys!

EDIT 3:

A lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term ""medic"" as anything more than ""person who gives medical assistance"" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.

I am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.

Is this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.

* Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)

NASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725
For more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/

This discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

At about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.

We're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything! 

**UPDATE (5:02 p.m. EST):** That's all the time we have for today. Thanks so much for all your great questions. Get more exoplanet news as it happens from http://twitter.com/PlanetQuest and https://exoplanets.nasa.gov

Thanks for the questions and for giving a damn. It's been an exhausting day and I think it's time to unplug. I'll check in tomorrow just to confirm my continued freedom and breathing.

UPDATE: No black suits yet. Things continue to be crazy. [NYT interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/business/media/fake-presidential-seal-trump.html) today clarified some things.

UPDATE 2: For anyone interested in the store, after multiple phone calls and speaking with PayPal customer service for quite literally hours, I have elected to [disable PayPal as a payment option](https://i.imgur.com/mOUXkNI.jpg) on onetermdonnie.com. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

IAmA,"Oh look. It’s that CISA surveillance bill again. Didn’t we defeat that? Not yet. One last chance (for real) to #StopCISA. Ask activists from Fight for the Future, Access, EFF, and Demand Progress anything about CISA.","The Senate is about to vote on a bill to reward companies that hand over your data to the NSA. We’re privacy advocates trying to stop it. Join us and call your lawmaker to vote no on the bill: https://stopcyberspying.com and https://decidethefuture.org

The reason you keep hearing about these bills is that we keep beating them. The other side has full time lobbyists pushing them every single day. We have you. But together, we keep winning.

With your help, we've stopped CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and other ""cybersecurity"" bills for years; however, they keep on coming back. Last week, the Senate scheduled CISA for a  final vote TOMORROW. We've been here before. And you already know the bill is a [surveillance bill in disguise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment).

People have sent millions of faxes (you read that right) to Congress, tweeted at senators, sent emails, and made calls. Over 50 organizations and companies oppose the bill including Access, ACLU, EFF, FFTF, Apple, Yelp, Twitter, and Wikimedia.

Fortunately, CISA isn’t law yet, but it will have its final Senate vote this week and we need a dozen more senators to vote against it. Two things you can do right now:

* [Call your lawmakers to vote no on the bill this week] (https://www.stopcyberspying.com) 

* [This is the fastest way to tweet at your senators](https://www.decidethefuture.org)

IAmA,"I made a free alternative to Photoshop, that is used by 7 million people. Ask me Anything!","Hi, my name is Ivan Kutskir, I am 29 y.o. and I live in Prague, the Czech Republic. I created [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) , an advanced image editor which works in a web browser. There were 7 million visitors in July.

I started to work on it in 2012, the first version was published in 2013, it was just my hobby until 2016, when I graduated and started to work on it full-time. I did not fully ""believe"" in Photopea until 2017, when I started to monetize it (with ads) and was able to make $400 a month :)

I had an AMA on Reddit [over a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c8ru2y/i_made_a_free_alternative_to_photoshop_that_is/) and I would like to tell you what happened since then :)

IAmA,"After a five-month search, I found two of my kidnapped friends who had been forced into marriage in China. For the past six years I've been a full-time volunteer with a grassroots organisation to raise awareness of human trafficking - AMA!","You might remember my 2016 AMA about my three teenaged friends who were kidnapped from their hometown in Vietnam and trafficked into China. They were ""lucky"" to be sold as brides, not brothel workers.

One ran away and was brought home safely; the other two just disappeared. Nobody knew where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive.

I gave up everything and risked my life to find the girls in China. To everyone's surprise (including my own!), I did actually find them - but that was just the beginning.

Both of my friends had given birth in China. Still just teenagers, they faced a heartbreaking dilemma: each girl had to choose between her daughter and her own freedom.

For six years I've been a full-time volunteer with 'The Human, Earth Project', to help fight the global human trafficking crisis. Of its 40 million victims, most are women sold for sex, and many are only girls.

We recently released an award-winning documentary to tell my friends' stories, and are now fundraising to continue our anti-trafficking work. You can now check out the film for $1 and help support our work at [http://www.sistersforsale.com](http://www.sistersforsale.com)

IAmA,"I’ve had a 71-year career in nuclear energy and have seen many setbacks but believe strongly that nuclear power can provide a clean, reliable, and relatively inexpensive source of energy to the world. AMA","I’ve been involved in nuclear energy since 1947.  In that year, I started working on nuclear energy at Argonne National Laboratories on safe and effective handling of spent nuclear fuel. In 2018 I retired from government work at the age of 92 but I continue to be involved in learning and educating about safe nuclear power.

After my time at Argonne, I obtained a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from MIT and was an assistant professor there for 4 years, worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 18 years where I served as the Deputy Director of Chemical Technology Division, then for the Atomic Energy Commission starting in 1972, where I served as the Director of General Energy Development. In 1984 I was working for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, trying to develop a long-term program for nuclear waste repositories, which was going well but was ultimately canceled due to political opposition.

Since that time I’ve been working primarily in the US Department of Energy on nuclear waste management broadly — recovery of unused energy, safe disposal, and trying as much as possible to be in touch with similar programs in other parts of the world (Russia, Canada, Japan, France, Finland, etc.) I try to visit and talk with people involved with those programs to learn and help steer the US’s efforts in the right direction.

My daughter and son-in-law will be helping me manage this AMA, reading questions to me and inputing my answers on my behalf.  (EDIT: This is also being posted from my son-in-law's account, as I do not have a Reddit account of my own.) Ask me anything.

IAmA,"We're the reporters who found 100+ former politicians’ campaign accounts spending campaign donations years after the campaign was over — sometimes, even when the politician was dead. AUA","**Our short bio:** We're Chris O'Donnell, Eli Murray, Connie Humburg and Noah Pransky, reporters for the Tampa Bay Times and 10News/WTSP. We've spent just short of a year investigating ['zombie campaigns'](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/): political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.

We found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members – all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.

It's not just small fish either. We found [Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=paul,%20ron) over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. [He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/ron_paul.mp4) outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. [Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=bunning) since he retired. [Mark Foley](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=foley), who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. [George LeMieux](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=lemieux) hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent [$41k+ on management consulting services](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00494971&recipient_name=milano&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=12%2F31%2F2016) and then [denied to us on camera](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/g_lemieux.mp4) when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. [Mark Takai](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=takai). A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.

IAmA,I am actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. You may remember me as Jaime Lannister on GoT... I've just launched a platform for grassroots giving called Dandi. AMA!,"Hi. ﻿ I’m excited to share Dandi with you. [www.dandi.io](https://dandi.io/)

Confronted by the enormous challenges we face both locally and globally, it’s easy to feel powerless and overwhelmed. 

For the past 4 years, I have been lucky to work for the UNDP as a goodwill ambassador and have seen not only the real challenges we face but also been blessed to meet dedicated people from all over the world desperately wanting to make the world a better place. 

Unfortunately, charities have to spend way too much time fundraising, branding and networking– and less time doing the important work. I have had countless discussions trying to find a way to better this system. 

By using technology there is a way. We need to insist on working together across nonprofits to make sure we achieve the goals we all share, as quickly and efficiently as possible. That resources go to the groups that can solve whatever a specific challenge calls for, as soon as the need is there. Dandi is a tool that can enable us to do just that. 

Using and combining huge amounts of data from nonprofits on the ground, we will be able to direct funds to where they will have the most positive impact– faster and more efficiently than ever before.

 I urge you to check out Dandi and join this new movement of collaborative humanitarian action. 

Thank you, 

Nikolaj

IAmA,I am a North Korean defector who was trafficked and sold as a bride in China AMA,"***Update*** I am logging off! Thank you so much for all the great questions! I can tell by the questions that many people here care about the North Korean people and know that they are different from the regime. I wish I had more time to answer more questions but it is my last night in America before going back to South Korea and I want to eat some great NYC food! I will try to answer some questions later tonight if I have some time :) 

***Annyeonghaseyo!*** 

My name is Joy and I’m from North Korea. I escaped to China when I was 18 but was immediately trafficked and sold as a bride to a Chinese man for $3,000 USD. Life was difficult, but I gave birth to a daughter who became the joy of my life. After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day. 

Because I have family in North Korea that could face punishment if my identity was revealed, I cannot share my real name or show my face.

I am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK’s new film [Sleep Well, My Baby](https://www.sleepwellmybaby.com/). It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I’m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.

[Liberty in North Korea](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/) is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes.

IAmA,"United Airlines sued me last year for creating Skiplagged, a site that saves consumers money on airfare by exposing secrets. Instead of shutting it down, United made Skiplagged go viral worldwide and supporters donated over $80,000! Today, there's no lawsuit and Skiplagged is still marching on. AMA","Update: reddit hug of death, try the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skiplagged) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skiplagged-actually-cheap/id823443083) apps if website fails <3 . We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.

This is a followup to the [AMA I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/), just after the federal lawsuit was filed.

Hey guys, I founded [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com). Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city. 

Basically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. [New York to San Francisco example](http://i.imgur.com/Np06G1j.jpg). There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.

While Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as ""skiplagging"". United Airlines didn't like any of this. 

Around September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.

Fast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.

Skiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be [on national tv](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-cheap-airfare-made-easier-with-skiplagged-startup/). Then cnn reached out and [published an article](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/29/news/united-orbitz-sue-skiplagged-22/). Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions. 

Fast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.

From running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community. 

**Also, I need your help.** 

The crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000.

IAmA,"I’m Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit, I’m Steve Wozniak.

I will be participating in a Reddit AMA to answer any and all questions. I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don’t have an answer to a specific question or that I don’t know enough to answer it. 

I recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series **Formative**, in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY

The founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple’s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.

I’m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we’ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.

I admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don’t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.

I'm back to answer some more questions and to let you know that I'm involved in a campaign to sell some #DammitJerry t'shirts/hoodies/mugs to support the #TuberousSclerosisAlliance.  This organization helps children born with tumors on their organs who very sadly end up having numerous seizures throughout the day for most of their lives.  It's a wonderful group of people and I'm always happy to do anything I can to help this awesome cause.  Please go to www.Represent.com/Jim and get your #DammitJerry swag.  :)  Now, bring on the questions.  :)



Well, I've gotta get ready for my FB Live with Josh McDermott.  We'll be live at 3PM PST.  Please check us out and ask whatever questions you might have.  I'll also be with Andrew J. West at the Laemmle's on Wilshire in Beverly Hills at 7:30pm for the screening of Middle Man.  Go to their website for tix.  We'll be doing a Q&A after the film.

I want to thank you all for taking the time to either ask questions or check out the answers.  I love doing these kind of things.  I think they're much more revealing than your average interview.  REDDIT is one of the greatest places for information about ... anything.  Literally anything.  

I'm heading to Boston tomorrow to go to the 7:30pm screening of Middle Man at the Boston Common 19 on Tremont Street.  I'll also by in NYC on Tuesday at the Empire Theater on 42nd to meet people at the 7:30pm (I think...if not around that time) where we'll also be doing a Q&A with me and director Ned Crowley.

Please check me out on The Late Late Show with Seth Meyers next Wednesday, the 14th.  Seth is one of the really good guys.  I love being on his show.

Again, thank you for all the great questions and taking the time out to spend with me.  I'm forever astounded and grateful for the love I'm shown every day.

xoxoxo
Jim




EDIT 1: Hey everyone.  I have to do a phone interview at 11 PST.  I'll be back after we hang up.  In the mean time check out the trailer for Middle Man.  I promise you a thrilling, dark, funny ride with this film:

http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

Hey Reddit! 
Thank you for having me back! I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called ""Middle Man""  which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol. 

In the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result – as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.

Here's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

**My Proof:** I wish I could provide concrete proof, but my phone is still in the classroom so this is a screenshot of my schedule on my Virtual Counselor http://prntscr.com/ifnngt

**EDIT New Proof:** My student ID - https://imgur.com/a/4FJjU#1yeF8Vx

Hi everyone, my name is Sid, I'm a Junior at Stoneman Douglas and I'd like to share my story of what went on in [room 1214, the third room](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/2EUXR1ZMYKOXietnIWiME2HyPxbqeFWu0OhUn-U3BIE/https/image.prntscr.com/image/scY9hNCkQ1_nLGOsx_VdKw.png?width=676&height=327) that was shot into by the shooter, and where two victims, Nick Dworet and Helena Ramsey were killed.

2:20 PM - We are working on the laptops doing an online activity when we hear about 10-15 gunshots outside of our door. Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(

[Here is an edited version of the map](http://prntscr.com/ifnd5k) to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red). Thank you for the support you have been giving. And if any of you came out to the vigil yesterday, I have no words for how happy I am that you came to support.

IAmA,I just spent my first year as a free man after being wrongfully convicted and incarcerated for 23 years. AMA,"I'm Ricky Kidd. In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide — a crime I didn’t commit. I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn’t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 23 years behind bars trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of 2019, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me. After I got out, I started ""I Am Resilience,"" an organization that raises awareness about those who have been wrongly convicted. Last month, I got married and, in December, we're expecting a baby daughter.
 
And I’m Sean O’Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. With the help of UMKC clinical students and my co-counsel, Cindy Dodge,  I represented Ricky for more than a decade and eventually got him released last year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row. Before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.
 
Ricky’s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America’s public defender systems was the subject of a PBS NewsHour podcast called [“Broken Justice,”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice) released last year. In October, about a year after Ricky was released, producer Frank Carlson checked in with him [for a special episode](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice/an-update-from-ricky-kidd).

Find out who is doing the work in your community, and support them. Sister Helen Prejean says if all you can do is bake a pie, bake a pie and bring it to a meeting!

IAmA,I’m a reporter who investigated a Florida psychiatric hospital that earns millions by trapping patients against their will. Ask me anything.,"I’m Neil Bedi, an investigative reporter at the Tampa Bay Times (you might remember me from this [2017 AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6vbfpe/were_reporters_who_investigated_a_power_plant/)). I spent the last several months looking [into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/) while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida’s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in [the story](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/).

In recent years, the hospital has been one of the [most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/#chartbuilder-export). It’s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility. 

Last year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon “BJ” Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers’ practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits. He has no experience in healthcare. Now he runs the 126-bed hospital.

We also found that the hospital is part of a large chain of behavioral health facilities called Acadia Healthcare, which has had problems across the country. Our reporting on North Tampa Behavioral and Acadia is continuing. If you know anything, email me at [nbedi@tampabay.com](mailto:nbedi@tampabay.com).

IAmA,"Iama guy who purchased a 380 acre ‘ghost town’ with a friend. It once was California’s largest silver mine, has a population of 4500, and was known to have a murder a week. Currently it has a population of 1. AMA","Hello reddit!

My name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of “Cerro Gordo” this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. 

The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  

The Los Angeles News once wrote:

“What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.”

In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.

It’s been a wild ride so far owning a ‘ghost town’ and we’re having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it.

",
IAmA,Paperless voting machines are just waiting to be hacked in 2020. We are a POLITICO cybersecurity reporter and a voting security expert – ask us anything.,"Intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russian hackers will return to plague the 2020 presidential election, but the decentralized and underfunded U.S. election system has proven difficult to secure. While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.

[Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/), which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.

To understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions — including state and county governments — that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: [More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/). For various reasons — from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience — [America’s voting machines won’t be completely secure any time soon](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/election-security-cybersecurity-1445539).

**Ask us anything**.  ([Proof](https://twitter.com/politico/status/1161300134933618688))

A bit more about us:

**Eric Geller** is the POLITICO cybersecurity reporter behind this project. His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states’ efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO’s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.

Before joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC’s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration’s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.–China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.

IAmA,"7 years ago I decided to walk every block in NYC. I've now covered more than 9,000 miles on foot, with a few hundred left to go. AMA!","My name is Matt Green. About a decade ago I quit my civil engineering job and spent 5 months walking 3,100 miles across the United States, from Rockaway Beach, NYC, to Rockaway Beach, Oregon. After returning to the East Coast, I drifted around and worked odd jobs for a while before deciding to take on another walking project, this time focused on one place: walking every block of every street in the 5 boroughs of NYC, plus parks, cemeteries, beaches, bridges, and other outdoor public(ish) spaces.

I don't have a particular goal or focus when I'm walking. I just try to pay attention to whatever's around me. It's amazing how much there is to see everywhere, whether you're in the middle of North Dakota, Staten Island, or Times Square. It just takes a long time to open your eyes to it all. I'm still working on opening mine. I meet a lot of people, take a lot of photos, and do a lot of research afterward to figure out the stories behind the things I encountered. I document the small wonders (and non-wonders) that I see and learn about on my website, [imjustwalkin.com](https://imjustwalkin.com/).

**Another edit!**

Since many of you had questions about art-related stuff, you might be interested in taking part in the fan art contest: http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=726


**---**

We're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.

Before Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))

We knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.

After a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.

Unfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!

After that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it. After 3 years of hard, hard work, the game is finished, and we're pretty proud of it.

announcements,"The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating, but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.","Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that we’re going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House in order for the rules to be fully restored, this is still an incredibly important step in that process—one that could not have happened without all your phone calls, emails, and [other activism](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/).

We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting.

announcements,Upvote the Downvote: Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality!,"Hey, Reddit! 

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. 

The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one. 

“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**

# What is it?

The Congressional Review Act \(CRA\) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).

# What’s happening in Congress?

Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! 

# What should I do?

Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.

If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”

# Pro tips:

\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. 

\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).

\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.

\-**Don’t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",Entertainment
announcements,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.

Hey Reddit, time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight!

When we [last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/80jsi9/upvote_the_downvote_tell_congress_to_use_the_cra/) on this in February, we told you about the [Congressional Review Act](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate), which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let’s remind them that we’re watching!

[Today, you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign) in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \(both of ‘em!\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort [here](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/).

We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in r/politics today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!

Finally, seeing [the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality\-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!

There is strength in numbers, and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big, Reddit\-y hug.

announcements,An update on the recent issues surrounding a Reddit employee,"We would like to give you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we took to prevent doxxing and harassment.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

announcements,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,"**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. 

**What happened?**

On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. 

Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.

Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.

**What information was involved?**

Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:

* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**
   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**
   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. 
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. 

As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.

**What is Reddit doing about it?**

Some highlights. We:

* Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
* Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password. 
* Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)

**What can you do?**

First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.

If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today. 

If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this [help page](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data).

And, as in all things, a strong unique password and [enabling 2FA](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) (which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",Entertainment

Today, in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content, we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

announcements,Scores on posts are about to start going up,"In the 11 years that Reddit has been around, we've accumulated [a lot of rules](https://i.redd.it/oek2mm1io01y.png) in our vote tallying as a way to mitigate cheating and brigading on posts and comments.   [Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.   


**TL;DR** voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot.

announcements,Protecting the Free and Open Internet: European Edition,"Hey Reddit,

We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet, and we know Redditors do too. Specifically, we’ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now’s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will [vote on changes](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44412025) to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:

* **Article 11** would create a ""link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit. 
* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user\-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.   

The unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe. 

Luckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm. 

Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for [an AMA on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/). In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!

As a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an [easy tool](https://act.openmedia.org/savethelink-call) to help you identify and call your MEP.

Here are some things you’ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP’s office:

* Share your name, location and occupation.
* Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).
* Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?
* Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message—your concern will still be registered.
* Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human. 

Phone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!

There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland [noted](http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliament-rejects-sweeping-internet-copyright-reforms-2018-7) that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote.

They hosted informative AMAs with [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) and Europe’s leading [independent experts on copyright reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/), they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out [their tally of the July 5th vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8wblrj/mep_votes_on_the_eu_copyright_directive_by_name/) to see how your MEP voted), and they [used megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8q1mfc/on_the_eu_copyright_reform/) to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help. 

# What’s Next?

This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. 

The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

announcements,TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.,"**tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

announcements,"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here","**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

announcements,Spring forward… into Reddit’s 2019 transparency report,"**TL;DR: Today we published our 2019** [**Transparency Report**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019)**. I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all,

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019, we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content**,
   * **55.9k accounts**, and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).
* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.

announcements,It’s Election Day 2018 and We’ve Compiled Some Resources to Help You Vote,"Redditors of all stripes spend a lot of time talking about politics, and today is the day to take those views straight to the ballot box. It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.

**Where do I vote?**

Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office ([find yours here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.

There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area. [The Voting Information Tool](https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/) is one of the easiest to use.

**Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?**

It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so **you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered**. You can [check your state’s registration requirements here](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration). In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.

**What do I need to bring with me?**

Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect). **If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.** Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!

**What am I going to be voting on?**

Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can [look up a sample ballot for your area](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.

**I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?**

Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can [learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.](https://www.usa.gov/election-day#item-212487)

**Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?**

Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials ([look up their contact info here](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)). **If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),** [**report it to the admins here**](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request/investigations)**.**

**I have more questions about voting!**

DoSomething.org is back doing a [marathon AMA today](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9up8z2/we_are_experts_on_youth_voter_turnout_and_how/) with their experts in [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) starting at 11am ET to answer all your additional voting questions.

announcements,Protect your account with two-factor authentication!,"You asked for it, and we’re delivering! Today, all Reddit users have the option to enable [two-factor authentication](https://i.redd.it/2y66bw0sapb01.gif) for an additional layer of account security.

We have been [slowly rolling this feature out](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7bfoqg/twofactor_authentication_now_available_for/), starting with beta testers, moderators, and third-party app developers, to ensure a positive experience across devices. Your feedback has been incredibly valuable, from pointing out bugs to recommending features. Thank you to everyone involved in testing.

Two-factor adds more security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. In this case, if you opt into 2FA, you’ll access a 6-digit verification code generated by your phone after a new sign-in attempt.

With two-factor enabled, even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you.

You can enable two-factor by selecting the [password/email](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/) tab under your preferences on desktop. Select **enable** under _two-factor authentication_ and follow the steps given to you. And make sure to generate your backup codes in the event your phone is unavailable! You can find more help in our [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication).

Two-factor is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party apps. It requires an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or any app supporting the TOTP protocol) to generate your 6-digit verification code.

A few handy security reminders:

* Choose a strong and unique password. We recommend at least 8 characters. And don’t reuse the same password on Reddit as other sites!
* Add a verified email address. Email is the only way for us to reset your account. (We do require a verified email for setting up two-factor authentication since the account can be lost if, for example, you lose your phone).
* Check your [account activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) for recent logins. It’s a good idea to look at this page from time to time to make sure there’s nothing fishy going on.

announcements,It’s US National Voter Registration Day. Are You Registered?,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address. 

Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with [Nonprofit VOTE](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/) to celebrate [National Voter Registration Day](https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/) and help spread the word before the midterms this November.

You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments. 

We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments. 

Also check out the AMAs we have planned for today as well, including:

* [A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9is2zm/we_are_secretaries_of_state_steve_simon_mn_and/) in r/politics from 10am-12pm ET
* [An AMA about the weird quirks and history of American voting laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9iso2g/today_is_national_voter_registration_day_i_am_an/) with DoSomething.org’s Head of Campaigns in r/IAmA at 11am ET.
* You can also see the [AMA that National Voter Registration Day’s Executive Director](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9ii6uf/im_brian_miller_executive_director_of_national/) did yesterday.

Finally, be sure to take this occasion to [make sure that you are registered to vote](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/voting-in-your-state/) where you live, or update your registration as necessary. Don’t be left out on Election Day!

announcements,"Hey, it’s Reddit’s totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.","Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x…) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics’. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

**UPDATE 9/12/18:** Unfortunately [the vote didn't go our way](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/12/eu-lawmakers-pass-controversial-digital-copyright-law.html), with both Articles 11 and 13 passing. We're going to have to assess what this means for Reddit, and determine what next steps might be. While this isn't the result that we hoped for, I'd still like to thank all the redditors who contacted their MEPs about this. We'll keep you updated about what comes next. For those interested in the details of how individual party blocks and MEPs voted, Julia Reda has [more details here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/ep-endorses-upload-filters/).

Hey Everyone!

(And a very special *bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,* and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)

It’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet.

[When we last left you](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/) on July 5 (aka [Meme Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeDay/)), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install [error-prone copyright filters](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwkbad/this-music-theory-professor-just-showed-how-stupid-and-broken-copyright-filters-are) on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.

The July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments, [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) has a [pretty good rundown of them here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/) (note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily).

The bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi [break down why that is here](https://edri.org/copyright-compulsory-filtering-instead-of-obligatory-filtering-a-compromise/)).

The good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in [A©tion Week](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at [SaveYourInternet.eu](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them.

Check it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!

announcements,"In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I’d like to share our thinking.","In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it’s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, we’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don’t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015–2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOP’s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It’s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues. It’s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we’re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know it’s frustrating that we don’t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries.

announcements,"Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.","Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

announcements,It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.,"Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit’s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook’s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (“Knight”) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court’s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230’s immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

I’ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can’t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

announcements,Introducing r/popular,"Hi folks!

Back in the day, the original version of the front page looked an awful lot like r/all.  In fact, it *was* r/all.  But, when we first released the ability for users to [create subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/03/12/make-your-own-reddit/), those new, nascent communities had trouble competing with the larger, more established subreddits which dominated the top of the front page.  To mitigate this effect, we created the notion of the defaults, in which we *cherry picked* a set of subreddits to appear as a default set, which had the effect of editorializing Reddit. 

Over the years, Reddit has grown up, with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities, each with enormous reach and great content. Consequently, the “defaults” have received a disproportionate amount of traffic, and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit. We, therefore, are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching r/popular, which, like r/all, opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page. 

**Logged out users will land on “popular” by default and see a large source of diverse content.  
Existing logged in users will still maintain their subscriptions.**

##How are posts eligible to show up “popular”?
First, a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place. 
Post from the following types of communities will not show up on “popular”:  

* NSFW and 18+ communities
* Communities that have opted out of r/all
* A handful of subreddits that users [consistently filter](https://i.redd.it/vxybnlltm2gy.gif) out of their r/all page
  

##What will this change for logged in users?
Nothing! Your frontpage is still made up of your subscriptions, and you can still access r/all. If you sign up today, you will still see the 50 defaults. We are working on making that transition experience smoother. If you are interested in checking out r/popular, you can do so by clicking on the link on the gray nav bar the top of your page, right between “FRONT” and “ALL”. 
  

**TL;DR:** We’ve created a new page called “popular” that will be the default experience for logged out users, to provide those users with better, more diverse content. 
  

Thanks, we hope you enjoy this new feature!

announcements,Reddit's new signup experience,"Hi folks,
 
**TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.**

 
Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.  

Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched r/popular as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results. 
 

New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick [tutorial page](https://i.redd.it/77yt9bbojv0z.png) on how to subscribe to communities.

On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding [in-line subscription buttons](https://i.redd.it/ccdmg3aujv0z.png) that show up next to communities you’re not subscribed to.


To the communities formerly known as defaults - thank you.  You were, and will continue to be, awesome. To our new users - we’re excited to show you the breadth and depth our communities!

The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and stress; and throughout this time, it’s become even more clear how valuable Reddit is to millions of people looking for community, a place to seek and share information, provide support to one another, or simply to escape the reality of our collective ‘new normal.’

announcements,Why Reddit was down on Aug 11,"**tl;dr**

On Thursday, August 11, Reddit was down and unreachable across all platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.

Thank you all for contributions to r/downtimebananas.

**Impact**

On Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system. 

No data was lost.

**Cause and Remedy**

We use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. 

Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.

At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to “down mode” while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally. 

**Prevention**

As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations.

* Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
* Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations.
* Properly disable package management systems during migrations so they don’t affect systems unexpectedly.

**Last Thoughts**

We take downtime seriously, and are sorry for any inconvenience that we caused. The silver lining is that in the process of restoring our systems, we completed a big milestone in our operations modernization that will help make development a lot faster and easier at Reddit.",Entertainment

announcements,Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff),"Hi all,

Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

announcements,Karma for text-posts (AKA self-posts),"As most of you already know, fictional internet points are probably the most precious resource in the world.  On Reddit we call these points Karma.  You get Karma when content you post to Reddit receives upvotes.  Your Karma is displayed on [your userpage](http://reddit.com/u/me).

You may also know that you can submit different types of posts to Reddit.  One of these post types is a text-post (e.g. this thing you’re reading right now is a text-post).  Due to [various shenanigans and low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) we stopped giving Karma for text-posts over 8 years ago.

However, over time the usage of text-posts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit.  Who could forget such classics as:

- [Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/) - from r/starwars

- [You people make me sick [a grilled cheese meltdown]](https://np.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/2or1p3/you_people_make_me_sick/) - from r/grilledcheese 

Text-posts make up over 65% of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept text-posts. Because of this Reddit has become known for thought-provoking, witty, and in-depth text-posts, and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys.

To acknowledge this, from this day forward we will now be giving users karma for text-posts. This will be combined with link karma and presented as ‘post karma’ on [userpages](http://reddit.com/u/me).

announcements,Update to Our Content Policy,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

announcements,"With so much going on in the world, I thought I’d share some Reddit updates to distract you all","Hi All,

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We’re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

announcements,Changes to Reddit’s Political Ads Policy,"As the 2020 election approaches, we are updating our [policy on political advertising](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) to better reflect the role Reddit plays in the political conversation and bring high quality political ads to Redditors.

As a reminder, Reddit’s advertising policy already forbids deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising (political advertisers included). Further, each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content, we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside the United States, and we only allow political ads at the federal level.

That said, beginning today, we will *also* require political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments “on” for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage directly with users in the comments.

In tandem, we are launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency, which will list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1, 2019. In this community, you will find information on the individual advertiser, their targeting, impressions, and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit, so we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along, please subscribe to [r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/) for more information.

We hope this update will give you a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around important political issues, and provide a line of sight into the campaigns and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team, ensuring comments remain enabled for 24 hours, and establishing a political ads transparency subreddit, we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring important conversation, enabling our users to provide their own feedback on political ads, and better protecting the community from inappropriate political ads, bad actors, and misinformation.

Please see the full updated political ads policy below:

*All political advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved, the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative (for more information on the managed sales process, please see “Advertising at Scale”* [*here*](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)*.) Political advertisers will also be asked to present additional information to verify their identity and/or authorization to place such advertisements.*

*Political advertisements on Reddit include, but are not limited to, the following:*

* *Ads related to campaigns or elections, or that solicit political donations;*
* *Ads that promote voting or voter registration (discouraging voting or voter registration is not allowed);*
* *Ads promoting political merchandise (for example, products featuring a public office holder or candidate, political slogans, etc);*
* *Issue ads or advocacy ads pertaining to topics of potential legislative or political importance or placed by political organizations*

*Advertisements in this category must include clear ""paid for by"" disclosures within the ad copy and/or creative, and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Federal Elections Commission. All political advertisements must also have comments enabled for at least the first 24 hours of the ad run. The advertiser is strongly encouraged to engage with Reddit users directly in these comments. The advertisement and any comments must still adhere to Reddit’s* [*Content Policy*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)*.*

*Please note additionally that information regarding political ad campaigns and their purchasing individuals or entities may be publicly disclosed by Reddit for transparency purposes.*

*Finally, Reddit only accepts political advertisements within the United States, at the federal level. Political advertisements at the state and local level, or outside of the United States are not allowed.*

announcements,An update on the FireEye report and Reddit,"Last week, FireEye [made an announcement](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html) regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.

* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.
* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.
* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.
* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).

Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:

* 3% (4) had negative karma
* 33% (47) had 0 karma
* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma
* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma
* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma

To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:

* [u/emilyward2017](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilyward2017)
* [u/Homaeefar](https://www.reddit.com/user/Homaeefar)
* [u/alessia\_80s](https://www.reddit.com/user/alessia_80s)
* [u/Anzfp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzfp)
* [u/jeremybernard](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremybernard)
* [u/suarezanton](https://www.reddit.com/user/suarezanton)

Unlike our [last post on foreign interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.

Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.

We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we’ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.",Entertainment
announcements,Let’s all have a town hall about r/all,"Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

announcements,"Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion","Hello again,

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I’m serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

AMA!

### Hi everyone!

I’m Alex–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What’s New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.

### What’s Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!

announcements,Introducing the Solidarity Award — A 100% contribution to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO,"It’s been incredible to witness the ways in which the Reddit community has come together to raise awareness, share information and resources, and support each other during a time of universal need. Across the platform, existing communities like [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/), [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/), and [r/worldnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) have joined newly established communities like [r/Coronavirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/) and [r/COVID19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/) to share authoritative content and welcome important discussion every day.

At Reddit Inc., we’ve also been [working](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) to curate expert discussions and surface the most reliable information for you. And today, we’re excited to launch the Solidarity Award, which seeks to raise funds for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic via the [COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund](https://covid19responsefund.org/) for the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/). The fund -- which is powered by the [United Nations Foundation](https://unfoundation.org/) and the [Swiss Philanthropy Foundation](https://www.swissphilanthropy.ch/en/) \-- supports [WHO’s](https://www.who.int/) work to track and understand the spread of COVID-19, ensure patients get the care they need, frontline workers get essential supplies and information, and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments for the pandemic.

Starting today, you can purchase the Solidarity Award directly on Reddit desktop and mobile web (via PayPal or Stripe), and **100% of the proceeds** will benefit the [COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund](https://covid19responsefund.org/) for WHO.\*

**Here are a few details on the Solidarity Award**:

* How to find the Award: The Solidarity Award can only be given on Reddit desktop and mobile web (not currently available to give on Mobile apps). You'll find the award towards the bottom of the Medals section in our Award dialog.

announcements,Reddit’s 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings,"Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It’s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I’ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

announcements,TIL Reddit has a Design team,"In our previous two blog posts, [u/Amg137](/user/Amg137) talked about [why we’re redesigning Reddit on desktop](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) and [how moderation and community styling will work in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/). Today, I’m here as a hu~~man sacrifice m~~ember of Reddit’s Design team \(surprise: designers actually work at Reddit!\) to talk about how we’ve approached the desktop redesign and what we’ve learned from your feedback along the way.

When approaching the redesign, we all learned early on that this wasn’t just about making Reddit more usable, accessible, and efficient; it was also about learning how to interact, adapt, and communicate with the world’s largest, most passionate and genuine community of users.

# Better every (feedback) loop

Every team working on this project has its share of longtime redditors—whether it's Product, Design, Engineering, or Community. To say that this has been the most challenging \(and rewarding\) project of our careers is an understatement. Over the past year we’ve been running surveys internally and externally. We’ve conducted video conferences with first\-time users, redditors on their 10th Cake Day, moderators, and lurkers. Not to mention an extremely helpful community of alpha testers. You all have shaped the way we do every part of our jobs, from brainstorming and creating designs to building features and collecting feedback.

Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality, you came in and told us where we were wrong and, in most cases, explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you—like [making Classic and Compact views fill your screen](https://media1.tenor.com/images/782ba18e2ff1bb49a36ade1ab90f2869/tenor.gif?itemid=7549364) \(coming soon\).

# What? Reddit is evolving!

Reddit is not a one\-size\-fits\-all experience. It’s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:

* Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit
   * [Give communities tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) that are simple, intuitive, and flexible—for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.
* Make our desktop experience more welcoming
   * Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice \(e.g., different viewing options: [Card](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) / [Classic](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) / [Compact](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif)\) and familiarity to all users.
* Design a foundation for the future
   * Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.
* Keep content at the forefront
   * We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.

# Asking Reddit

As we moved from setting high\-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look\-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It’s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:

* Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a “hamburger menu” on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and [filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters](https://i.redd.it/1is6htgra3j01.gif).
* Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts \(aka “Create a post”\) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you’re creating.
* Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We’ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved \(e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic\), and we’re working on shipping fixes.

The list of user\-inspired changes goes on and on \(and we’re expecting a lot more *i*teration as we expand our testing pool\), but this is how we’ve worked through design challenges so far.

# It’s [never over](https://media.giphy.com/media/fQvND2Wo28q9a/giphy.gif)

The redesign isn’t finished at “GA” \(General Availability, or as I like to call it, “Time to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work”\). With this post, we wanted to share some context on our approach, thank everyone who's participated in r/redesign so far \(THANK YOU!\), and let you know we will continue to engage with you on a daily basis to understand how you’re responding to what we’re building.

Over the next several weeks, we'll be expanding the number of users who have access to the alpha \(yes, you will be able to opt out if you prefer the current desktop look\), hearing what you think, and updating all of you as we make more changes. In the meantime, I'll be sticking around in the comments for a bit to answer questions and [invite all of you to listen to Huey Lewis with me](https://youtu.be/J08ZwySCoJ8?t=84).

announcements,Account suspensions: A transparent alternative to shadowbans,"Today we’re rolling out a new type of account restriction called suspensions.  Suspensions will replace [shadowbans](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/) for the vast majority of real humans and increase transparency when handling users who violate [Reddit’s content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

## How it works

* Suspensions can only be applied to accounts by the Reddit admins (not moderators).
* Suspended accounts will always receive a notification about the suspension including reason and the duration:
    * [See example notification PM](http://i.imgur.com/wQJrnGR.png) - Sent to user account from r/reddit.com 
    * [See example on-page notification](http://i.imgur.com/yzzSXEU.png) - Shown on pages while an account is suspended 
* Suspended users can reply to the notification PM to appeal their suspension 
* Suspensions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of infraction and the user’s previous infractions. 

## What it does to an account

Suspended users effectively have their account put into read-only mode.  The primary actions they will not be able to perform are:

- Voting 
- Submitting posts 
- Commenting 
- Sending private messages 
  
Moderators who have been suspended will not be able to perform any mod actions or access modmail while the suspension is in effect.

You can see [the full list of forbidden actions for suspended users here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686).

Users in both temporary and permanent suspensions will always be able to delete/edit their posts and comments as usual.

Users browsing on a desktop version of the site will see a [pop-up notice](http://i.imgur.com/4uBMcu2.png) or [notification page](http://i.imgur.com/eyvYgt5.png) anytime they try and perform an action they are forbidden from doing.  App users will receive an error depending on how each app developer chooses to indicate the status of suspended accounts.

## User pages

* Visiting the user page of an account that has been permanently suspended will [indicate that the account has been suspended](http://i.imgur.com/eXIlh9i.png) and will not display any other data.
* Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended.
* In addition to this, we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly [display that the account in question was deleted by the user](http://i.imgur.com/bfTfhxs.png). 

## Why this is a good thing

Our current form of account restriction, [the shadowban](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/), is great for dealing with bots/spam rings but woefully inadequate for real human beings.  We think suspensions are a vast improvement.

* Suspensions inform people when they’ve broken the rules.  While this seems like a no-brainer, this helps so we can identify the specific behavior that caused the suspension.
* Users are given a chance to correct their behavior.  We’re all human and we all make mistakes.  Reddit believes in the goodness of people.  We think most people won’t intentionally continue to violate a rule after being notified.
* Suspensions can vary in length depending on the severity of the infraction and user’s history.  This allows flexibility when applying suspensions. Different types of infraction can have different responses.
* Increased transparency.  We want to be upfront about suspending user accounts to both the user being suspended and other users (where appropriate).

announcements,Changes to Our Policy Against Bullying and Harassment,"TL;DR is that we’re updating our harassment and bullying policy so we can be more responsive to your reports. 

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding content that [threatens, harasses, or bullies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), which you can read in full [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). 

**Why are we doing this?**
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.

The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. 

We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.

**How will these changes work in practice?**
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. 

You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. 

As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our [response times have improved significantly since the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/), but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.

**What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?**
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing > “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too; [report it to us here](https://www.reddit.com/report).

Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.

announcements,Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

Steve

&#x200B;

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",Entertainment

Hello again!

It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

announcements,Update regarding user profile transparency,"Edit (2019/11/26): This feature has been delayed until 2020

Edit (2020/03/30): We released a feature where you will get a push notification when you get a new follower. If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The follower list is still delayed until later this year.

Hi everyone,

We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.

We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.

We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.

If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!

Thanks!

With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.  

Though Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are *reusing passwords between sites*.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:

 * Choose a [strong, **unique** password](https://xkcd.com/936/).  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean ""use that really good password you use on sites you care about.""  I mean [""one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!""](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/)   [Password reuse is really bad!](https://xkcd.com/792/)  We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that *other* site you use the same password on who decides not to use [bcrypt](https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) but rather a [nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!](https://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/)
 * [Set and verify an email address](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.
 * [Check your own account activity page!](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity)  If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to [change your password](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.

On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in *for several years*.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password ""hunter2"". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!

**Q**: *But how do I make a unique password?*

**A**: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known [heuristics](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/11/passwords_are_not_br.html).  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]

**Q**: *What's with the fear mongering??*

**A**: [It's been a rough month.](https://i.redd.it/ua725p02cizw.jpg) Also, [don't just take it from me this is important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc)

**Q**: *Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?*

**A**: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if *we* get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  

Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a [huge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&hl=en) [ecosystem](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8) [of](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader&hl=en) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8), including our newly released [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  ""Adding 2FA to the login flow"" will require a lot of coordination.

**Q**: *Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!*

**A**: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know [who the enemy is](/user/me) and [why!](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/)

**Q**: *Do you realize you linked to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/ like three times?*

**A**: Actually it was four.

announcements,"New and improved ""block user"" feature in your inbox.","Reddit is a place where virtually anyone can voice, [ask about](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit) or [change their views on a wide range of topics](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview), share [personal, intimate feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avocadosgonewild), or [post cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsStandingUp/) [pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/316cats). This leads to great communities and deep meaningful discussions.  But, sometimes this very openness can lead to less awesome stuff like spam, trolling, and worse, harassment.  We work hard to deal with these when they occur publicly.  Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve just released a feature to help you filter them from within your own inbox: user blocking.

Believe it or not, we’ve actually had a [""block user"" feature](http://i.imgur.com/Tszb0YJ.png) in a basic form for [quite a while](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/4d7a2fa4e0f01f7010e0f7fd0317cb783cda54c1), though over time its utility focused to apply to only private messages.  [We’ve recently updated](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/6c9a28e6bd0cebc05e220b6d807b4bf46663474b) its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the “Block User” button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.  You will no longer be alerted if they message you further.  As before, the block is [completely silent to the blocked user](http://i.imgur.com/GUIBD9t.png).  Blocks can be viewed or removed on [your preferences page here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked/).

Our changes to user blocking are intended to let you decide what your boundaries are, and to give you the option to *choose* what you want—or don’t want—to be exposed to. [And, of course, you can and should still always *report* harassment to our community team!]

These are just our first steps toward improving the experience of using Reddit, and we’re looking forward to announcing many more.",Entertainment
announcements,"Out with 2016, in with 2017","Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago—especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven’t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

announcements,Time to talk,"Alright folks, [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.


I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.


Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.


With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.


A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.


When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.


That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.


The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.


In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. 

Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.

This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.


As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. 

Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.



That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.

So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?


The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.

---

Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.

Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!

A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.


Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.

We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.



Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!

A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.


Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?

A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.



Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!

A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).




That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.

",Entertainment
announcements,Let's talk content. AMA.,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

* **Updated for changes to our services.**  It’s [been a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2sk8i9/were_updating_the_reddit_privacy_policy_and_user/) since [our last significant User Agreement update](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/useragreement-2015-01-15.html).  In general, \*these\* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we’re replacing are no longer available \(RIP redditmade and reddit.tv\), we’ve created a more [robust API process](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), and we’ve launched [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/)!
* **European data protection law.**  Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as “Updates to our Privacy Policy” and “Reminder: Important update to our Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.”  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you’ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.
* **Clarity.**  While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise \(like the Copyright, DMCA & Takedown section in the User Agreement\), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy \(e.g., “don’t mess with Reddit” in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on “Breaking Reddit” in the content policy\).

Our work won’t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I’ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we’ve built a [dedicated anti\-evil team](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we’re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we’re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.  We appreciate the work you all have done to [responsibly report security vulnerabilities](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/whitehat) as you find them.

**Note**: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.

I know it can be [difficult to stay on top of](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/8hm7ak/this_visualized_design_shows_you_its_impossible/) all of these Terms of Service updates [\(and what they mean for you\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8euz34/lpt_with_new_privacy_regulations_coming_soon_and/), so we’ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.  I’m not a lawyer \(though I can sense their presence for the sake of this thread...\) so just remember we can’t give legal advice or interpretations.

**Edit:** Stepping away for a bit, though I'll be checking in over the course of the day.  ",Entertainment
announcements,A short-ish history of new features on Reddit,"Hi all,

Over the past few months, we’ve talked a lot about our desktop redesign—[why we’re doing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/), [moderation/styling tools we’re adding](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/), and, most recently, [how you all have shaped our designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/). Today, we’re going to try something a little different. We’d like to take all of you on a field trip, [to the Museum of Reddit](https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png)!

When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past \(on Reddit [and other sites](http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png)\). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.

**Trippin’ Through Time**

When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny’s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit’s front page [looked like this](https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg&s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456).

In the site’s early days, [u/spez](/user/spez) and [u/kn0thing](/user/kn0thing) played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests [by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks](http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html), and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned\-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/).

As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. \(Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...\)

They launched commenting. \(The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).\) They recoded the entire site [from Lisp to Python](https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg&s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217). They added [limits on the lengths of post titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/z9yk/reddit_headlines_have_been_getting_longer_and/). And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit’s biggest change to date: [user\-created subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/).

It’s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it [wasn’t without controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/). In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and [argued](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/) [passionately](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/) [against](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/) [subreddits](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/). \(Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched [our first desktop redesign](https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/), which received its share of [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/), [bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/), and [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/) reviews.\)

During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in\-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user\-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a [cumbersome URL trick](https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/) people used to make multireddits into [a supported feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/).

That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we’ve built in the years since then, like [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) \(my first project as an admin\), [video hosting](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/), [mobile apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/), [mobile mod tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/), [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/), [live threads](https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/), [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/), and [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/), to name a few.

**What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!**

Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:

* You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.
* The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.

With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third\-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like [set post requirements](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif) and [take bulk actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif) more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback \(more on that in our next blog post about engineering!\).

**Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts**

One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!

Like anything we’ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we’re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.

In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. \(Thank you to everyone who’s given feedback so far!\) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think.

announcements,Introducing Community Awards!,"**UPDATE (9/4):** Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been [announced below in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! Thanks to all who participated!

Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

[A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3620de655a42541537ce22dd37b7c673e94f1a20)

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Mods can access the Community Bank to give…

# Mod-Exclusive Awards

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* … and so on!

Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?

Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.

# Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?

Check out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!

We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:

* They must comply with [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);
* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
* They must be SFW.

# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!

We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!

Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!",Entertainment
announcements,"For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report","In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we’ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn’t easy as a small company as we don’t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, we’ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.

In addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. 

We are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. 

We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

* I’m [incredibly photogenic](http://imgur.com/4mZR3Jt)
* I love building.  Love VLSI, analog/digital circuitry, microarchitecture, assembly, OS design, network design, VM/JIT, distributed systems, ios/android/web, 3d modeling/animation/rendering.  Recently got into 3d printing - fucking LOVE it.  My 3d printer enables me to make nearly anything and have it materialize on my desk in a few hours. 
* I love people.  When I first became a manager, I discovered how amazing the human mind really is and endeavoured to learn everything I can.  I love studying the relationship between our limbic and rational selves, how communication breaks down, what motivates people / teams, and how to build amazing cultures.  I’m currently learning everything I can about what constitutes a strong company culture and trying to make the discussion of culture more rigorous than it currently is in the valley.
* My current non-Reddit projects are making a grocery list iOS app that’s super simple and just does the right thing (trying out App Engine for backend).  And the other is making this full size fully functional [thing](http://imgur.com/A41GI6o).

I’m suuuuper excited to be here!  I don’t know much at all yet (I’ve been an official employee for… 7 hours?), but I plan to do an AMA in 30 days (Sept 20ish) once I know a lot more.

I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

announcements,"We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)","In a little over a month we’ll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

announcements,"So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night!","We had not intended to make this announcement until we had everything in order but, since my resignation as head of community made its way to the media, I'd like to discuss why I'm leaving and what's next for you!
I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community. A large part of my role as Head of Community was reflected behind the scenes (policy, community regulation etc.) and the community team is much more interactive than I on a daily basis so very little will change after my departure.

Media outlets are suggesting that the circumstances around my departure are different than they are in reality so I'd like to clear this up as I don't like being misrepresented. Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause. That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them.

At the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family. The last few years have been pretty crazy and honestly, I'm looking forward to a Christmas free of work - but still encourage you all to continue to make the [reddit gift exchange](https://www.redditgifts.com/) a ground breaking experience!!! It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now. 

So what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.

Lucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When /u/spez asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of, /u/krispykrackers. Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community. A redditor since 2008, employed by reddit for five years, and a community manager for over a year, she has been a very important part of our daily community interactions and is so dedicated to her work that I'm not sure she even sleeps!

I'm very confident that krispy and spez, along with the rest of reddit, will guide the community to the best state it has ever been in and I am excited to see the future of reddit unfold with their leadership. 
Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!

Then you’ll be happy to hear: Night Mode has \(finally\) landed so you can read Reddit without searing your retinas \(we heard it’s a thing\).

We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit, and Night Mode has been a top feature request in the r/redesign community, so a few months ago we set out to build it.

...Annnnd now it’s been awhile since we first announced Night Mode was coming. Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough. But our design and engineering teams were undaunted: dive under the hood of the Design & Engineering effort to build Night Mode on the [blog](https://redditblog.com/2018/05/24/night-mode-is-finally-here/).

To start browsing Reddit in darkness, click on your username in the upper right hand corner, and then toggle it on. If you're on old Reddit, you can visit [http://new.reddit.com/](http://new.reddit.com/) to try out Night Mode. If you enjoy it, you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode.

We hope you’ll enjoy this retina\-saving feature as much as we do. But seriously jokes aside, we are continuously trying to improve Reddit for y'all and we'll post more soon. Let us know your thoughts on Night Mode.

Next week we’ll be providing an update about accessibility in the Redesign. While you wait, [check out our other recent updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair%3Achangelog&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)",Entertainment
announcements,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),"Hello hello,

We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...

## What’s New

*New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds*

Multireddits have been around a [long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/). They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.

*More Support*

We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.

[iOS Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5791cdff9b573aa06b2d79d244e261f5dea9e147)

*New Follow Functionality*

You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.

[Follow on new Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bce0dad14bdfa8864e638c7981c0756fcfe949c7)

*Improved Sharing*

We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.

*Spaces*

You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed. [Enough said.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif)

*Mix and Match*

Follow a mix of communities and profiles.

*Coming Soon*

In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.

## The Contest

We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the [gold](https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif) part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.

To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. **It must be public.** Please only submit one feed per category.

Here are the categories that we will award winners from:

* Aww
* Artist Resources
* Beauty
* Books & Writing
* Cool Pictures (images only)
* Discussion (text only)
* Fashion
* Food & Cooking
* Health & Fitness
* Music
* Parenting
* Quirky
* Sports
* Travel
* Wholesome

We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.

Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):

* [Some of my favorite communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/singshredcodesubbies/)
* Some of my [voice and singing communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/voices/)
* [Animal Subbies](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/animal_subbies/) (If you know of any cute-animal subs I missed, please comment below)
* [Asks](https://www.reddit.com/user/mujhair/m/asks/)
* Some [Admins’ favorites](https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit/m/admin_faves/) that were mentioned in this [r/askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/afzfa7/admins_of_reddit_whats_your_favorite_subreddit/) a few months ago

announcements,Because it’s Valentine’s Day… here’s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!,"Hi All,

Two weeks ago, we [kicked off our blog series](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.

Fun fact: When Reddit first launched, user\-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.

Without further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.

# Features inspired by the community

[**Image Flair - Emojis**](https://i.redditmedia.com/Tk7MR1_C8WtRpgrtnQfM4qziSIsS7q5S1lirkhcMlZo.png?s=048534b6d6837c5a0d2c708b34d2fe3f)

Giving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like [r/baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball)'s team logo flair and [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW)'s faction icons. To make this process simpler, we’re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.

[**Submit Validation**](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif)

Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren’t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.

[**Flair Filtering**](https://i.redditmedia.com/ERuv8BBJBhRL28_cexQVDulJ2q2djLR9tiSCoLmC7iw.png?s=22b5edba1b74e4e1ef604057907f7509)

Many subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities. [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting, [r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop) uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we’ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.

**Sidebar**

Many mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of [r/WholesomeMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeMemes) to [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA)'s schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes [text widgets](https://i.redd.it/7u6ttrufr6g01.png), [button widgets](https://i.redd.it/117hrvjx6af01.png), [image widgets](https://i.redd.it/uhg3r378s6g01.png), [a calendar widget](https://i.redd.it/t2l2jrhy6af01.png), [a related communities widget](https://i.redd.it/8kfygo3y6af01.png), and [a rules widget](https://i.redd.it/grx7kklsr6g01.png). But we’re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.

# Features inspired by 3rd-party tools

Communities themselves aren’t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd\-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite \(RES\).

**Toolbox:** [**Bulk Mod Actions**](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif)

Moderating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third\-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You’ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.

**RES:** [**Show All Images \(aka Card View\)**](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif)

RES has enhanced Reddit’s expandos \(i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs\) for years, and one of the most popular features has been “show all images” \(i.e., expand all the things!\). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post’s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.

**RES:** [**User Info Cards** **\(inline banning/muting\)**](https://i.redd.it/q070hj0yv6g01.gif)

When cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they’ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user’s stats \(like account age and karma score\) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio—plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.

**Toolbox:** [**Removal Reasons**](https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif)

Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox\-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we’re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. \(Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.\)

**Styling**

Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. [Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn’t work on mobile.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif) With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. \(But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.\)

With these new features, we're excited to say that [styling a community is much easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/). Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like [r/AskReddit](https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png), [r/CasualConversation](https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png), [r/Greenday](https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png), [r/ITookAPicture](https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png), and [r/NASCAR](https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png). We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.

**Join the Redesign!**

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews).",Entertainment

announcements,"Starting today, more people will have access to the redesign","**TL;DR –** *Today, we’ll begin welcoming a small percentage of users into version 1 of our redesigned desktop site. We still have many improvements & features to ship in the coming weeks, but we’re proud of what we’ve built so far and excited to get it in the hands of more people. And if you don’t like it, you can opt out.*

Our team has been hard at work redesigning our desktop site for more than a year. The main reasons [why we started this project in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) were to allow our engineers to build features faster and to make Reddit more welcoming. It has been a massive undertaking, but we started by [putting users and communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) first—building our designs based on feedback from moderators, longtime users, beta testers, and other redditors every step of the way.

**What’s happening today?**

Today, we’re beginning to give a small group of users access to the desktop redesign at random. We’re starting with a small group to test the load on our servers and plan to make the opt\-in available to everyone in the coming weeks. On behalf of the team, thank you for all of your comments, posts, bug tests, conversations with our designers, creative ideas, and other feedback over the past year. We are very proud of what we have accomplished together and we are excited for you to get [your hands on it](https://i.redd.it/oki81jw2tro01.gif).

Without further ado, and for those who don’t have access yet… here’s what the redesign looks like:

* [Card](https://i.redditmedia.com/gbs_FDZ89LIg_RfJjYoIcD5c7X13DN32gy0oob-lDuM.png?s=806b9c18e3dee0383d8ab7c02fc3607a)

* [Compact](https://i.redd.it/ej52w79m4jp01.png)

All that said, we know that many of you love Reddit [just the way it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJWM5FmZyqU). If you are one of the lucky few chosen to test out the redesign and prefer the existing Reddit experience, you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top or visit [old.reddit.com](http://reddit.com/). Furthermore, we do not have plans to do away with the current site. We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit ^(we are looking at you i.reddit.com.)

**What’s next?**

As those of you who’ve given us redesign feedback already know, Reddit can be extremely complex. That said, we have not yet rebuilt all of our current features. We’re still iterating on your feedback and building more of the features you love \-\- such as native nightmode and keyboard shortcuts \-\-  plus more new features, which will arrive in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future. We’ve made r/redesign the community dedicated for feedback on the redesign, public to everyone and post weekly updates on our progress there.

We’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer questions.

announcements,Revamping the Quarantine Function,"While Reddit has had a [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.  

On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine. 

The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.     

Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.  

Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. 

You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits).

This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com) and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.

announcements,Let's talk about Orlando,"Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let’s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news’ policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We–Reddit Inc, moderators, and users–all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We’ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. ",Entertainment
announcements,And Now a Word from Reddit’s Engineers…,"Hi all,

As you may have heard, we’ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts, [u/Amg137](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amg137) and [u/hueylewisandthesnoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/hueylewisandthesnoos) talked about[ why we're redesigning](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign),[ moderation in the redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded),[ our approach to design](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team), and[ Reddit’s evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit). Today, Reddit’s Engineering team invites you “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s core stack.

Spoiler: There’s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we’ll get through it together.

**History and Journey**

For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit’s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days—a [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \(aka “r2”\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.

Given Reddit’s historically tiny eng team \(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\), our code wasn’t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:

* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): ""For a while now, ‘The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist’ has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.”
* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): ""After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \(unsurprisingly\) part of the code review process is to use ‘git blame’ to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \(one of the more core JS files we had\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‘full stack’ to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \(and depressed\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \(a senior web dev\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.""
* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): “I worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.”

Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team’s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you’ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\), and new features \(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.

Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit’s desktop code to date.

**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**

Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn’t want to outright break.

When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble—with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit’s 330 million monthly users.

But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase ""developer velocity,"" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more ""git blame"" for decade\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.

**The New Tech Stack**

These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:

* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\-related bugs, has good built\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)

**Just the Beginning**

With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We’ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we’ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\). So far, we’ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of \~20 features and 200\+ bugs per month.

We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items \(like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts\), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign—and because of our engineers’ work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.

Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish—we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn’t want to use it.

[Thank you](https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif) to everyone who’s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.

announcements,Updates to our media previews,"#What is a media preview?

On Reddit, a media preview is an image, video, or gallery in a **link post** that can be expanded with a button and viewed directly on listings and comments pages without having to leave Reddit.  Right now, we have media previews for certain types of videos, image galleries and sound files.  Media previews are controlled by [buttons that look like this](http://i.imgur.com/epKvK2w.png).

#That’s wonderful, but what have you actually changed?

**Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages**

By default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.  [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png).  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.

**New Media Preferences**

You can control how media previews display on your screen with [new preferences](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) available on your [preferences page](http://reddit.com/prefs).  

**Media previews support more file types**

We’ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.  Put simply, if you submit a link post to to Reddit with a URL that ends in `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., that media will be expandable.  Put even simply-er, more content on Reddit will have a preview available.

**NSFW Flows**

Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages, we’ve also added an[ optional screen to block NSFW media](http://i.imgur.com/bdCCAat.gifv). This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media.

**TL;DR:**

- [Media previews auto-expand on comments pages](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png) 
- [New user preferences to control media previews](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) 
- More media previews!

announcements,"Transparency is important to us, and today, we take another step forward.","In January of this year, we published our first [transparency report](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/01/reddits-first-transparency-report.html). In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the [content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014#wiki_requests_for_removal_of_user_information), and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.

Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove **everything**: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than [this, surprised and censored Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/FSXEP66.png).

There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.

Today, this changes. 

**Effective immediately,** we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.

Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen [in its original state here](http://i.imgur.com/Fn5cQFu.png), featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.

Should we receive a [valid DMCA request](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_dmca) for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see [a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why](http://i.imgur.com/gcwz5ks.png). 

A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.

You can view an example of a removed post and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingEffects/comments/35urvq/test_post_please_ignore/).

We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.

Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

announcements,TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile,"Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You’ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We’re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour’s new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he’s doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for “shitty_watercolour”, “kn0thing”, “leagueoflegends” and you’ll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we’re starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our “friends” feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What’s next?
* We’re taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit’s existing communities, which is why we’re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We’ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We’re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They’ll be able to post to their profile and you’ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (“alpha”) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we’re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There’s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that’s ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We’re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere — therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can’t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We’re also testing a new feature called “Active in these Communities” on the tester’s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we’re being so careful about how we’re testing this feature — we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what’s the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing “friends” feature?**

A: We’re not making any changes to the existing “friends” feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don’t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I’m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you’re wrong?**

A: We don’t have all of the answers right now and that’s why we’re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we’re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won’t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We’ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We’re also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). ",Entertainment
announcements,"From 1 to 9,000 communities, now taking steps to grow reddit to 90,000 communities (and beyond!)","Today’s announcement is about making reddit the best community platform it can be: tutorials for new moderators, a strengthened community team, and a policy change to further protect your privacy.

What started as 1 reddit community is now up to over 9,000 active communities that range from originals like /r/programming and /r/science to more niche communities like /r/redditlaqueristas and /r/goats. Nearly all of that has come from intrepid individuals who create and moderate this vast network of communities. I know, because I was reddit’s first ""community manager"" back when we had just one (/r/reddit.com) but you all have far outgrown those humble beginnings.

In creating hundreds of thousands of communities over this decade, you’ve learned a lot along the way, and we have, too; we’re rolling out improvements to help you create the next 9,000 active communities and beyond!



**Check Out the First Mod Tutorial Today!**

[We’ve started a series of mod tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THHl3VT4vms), which will help anyone from experienced moderators to total neophytes learn how to most effectively use our tools (which we’re always improving) to moderate and grow the best community they can. Moderators can feel overwhelmed by the tasks involved in setting up and building a community. These tutorials should help reduce that learning curve, letting mods learn from those who have been there and done that.   



**New Team & New Hires**

Jessica (/u/5days) has stepped up to lead the community team for all of reddit after managing the redditgifts community for 5 years. Lesley (/u/weffey) is coming over to build better tools to support our community managers who help all of our volunteer reddit moderators create great communities on reddit. We’re working through new policies to help you all create the most open and wide-reaching platform we can. We’re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We’re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community -- [spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam](http://redd.it/2mc9tt), not dealing with spam in your subreddit.



**Protecting Your Digital Privacy**

Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we’ve cared deeply about since reddit’s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address.

No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified. [As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#section_involuntary_pornography).

[We’re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.](http://redd.it/2sk8i9) We’ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report.

We made reddit to be the world’s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We’re learning together as we go, and today’s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond.

We’re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey.

announcements,Affiliate links on Reddit,"Hi everyone,

Today we’re launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won’t be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled “replace all affiliate links”.

The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We’ve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.

We’re structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it’s worth our time. It’s important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.

Thanks for your support.

Cheers,

Some FAQs:

**Will this work with my adblocker?**
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.

**Are the outgoing links HTTPS?**
Yes.

**Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?**
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.

**Can I switch this off for my subreddit?**
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.

**Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?**
~~Yes, this will be completed shortly.~~ This is available [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?** When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?** If I post a link to [a storm trooper necklace](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-Storm-Trooper-3D-Necklace/111817866493?_trksid=p2047675.c100009.m1982&_trkparms=aid%3D777000%26algo%3DABA.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131227121020%26meid%3Daa3df26a727e4999b28c34077939ff19%26pid%3D100009%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D112015566756) and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.

**EDIT 3** We've added some questions about this feature to the [FAQ](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT 4** For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out *provided you have changed the user setting*. This will go live later today.

**EDIT 5** The user preference has been added for *all* users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled ""replace affiliate links"" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 3): Can I get an ELI5?** When you click on a link to some (~5k) online stores, Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase. If you don't like this, you can opt out via the user preference labeled ""replace affiliate links"".

**EDIT (additional FAQ 4): The name of the user preference is confusing, can you change it?** Feedback taken, thanks. The preference will be changed to ""change links into Reddit affiliate links"". I'll update the text above when the change rolls out. Thanks!

announcements,American Censorship Day - Stand up for ████ ███████ ,"reddit,

Today, the US House Judiciary Committee has a hearing on the [Stop Online Piracy Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) or SOPA. The text of the bill is [here](http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). This bill would strengthen copyright holders' means to go after allegedly infringing sites at detrimental cost to the freedom and integrity of the Internet. As a result, we are joining forces with organizations such as the EFF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/).

Part of this act would undermine the [safe harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor) provisions of the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington, please consider [writing your representative](https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml) and the sponsors of this bill:

announcements,"Marty Weiner, Reddit CTO, back to CTO all the things","Aaaarr-arahahhraarrrr.  That’s Wookie for “Hello again, hope you’re doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh”,

I’m back to chat [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3hs3v4/im_marty_weiner_the_new_reddit_cto/).  It’s already been a month and a wild ride the whole time.  I’ve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there’s lots to do here… who knew?).

Here’s a few updates:

* I’m still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2’s legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely ""super highest priority"".

Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

announcements,New look on Reddit mobile web: compact view,"**TL;DR:** Mobile web users will be redirected to a new compact view on m.reddit.com starting today

**Hi everyone!**
Over the past few months, we have worked hard to improve the Reddit experience on mobile devices with the launch of native mobile apps and a new mobile web experience. We launched a mobile web beta a little while back and thanks to the community involved, we were able to make improvements for an official launch today. Starting today, users on mobile web will be directed to m.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com.  

**Easy way to opt out:**
If you prefer to stick with www.reddit.com, there is a very easy way to opt out. All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select ‘Desktop Site’. The next time you come back, you will be served the desktop site by default. [Here](https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif) is a short gif that demonstrates how to opt out.

**What’s next?**
Please give it a try and post any feedback you have — we'd love to hear how we can make it better. This is just the beginning of making the mobile web experience as seamless as possible for all of you.

announcements,CEO Steve here to answer more questions.,"It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

announcements,Reddit in 2016,"Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

–Steve

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out https://www.reddit.com/jobs.",Entertainment
announcements,We recommend that you change your reddit password,"Greetings all,


As you may have heard, reddit quickly patched its SSL endpoints against server attack of the infamous heartbleed vulnerability. However, the heartbleed vulnerability has been around for quite some time, and up until it was publicly disclosed reddit's SSL endpoints were vulnerable.

Additionally, our application was found to have a client-side vulnerability to heartbleed which allowed memory to be leaked to external servers. We quickly addressed this after it was reported to us. Exploiting this vulnerability required the use of a specific API call on reddit, and we have analyzed our logs and found nothing to suggest that this API call was being exploited en masse. However, the vulnerability did exist.

Given these two circumstances, it is recommended that you [change your reddit password](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) as a precaution. Updating your password will log you out of all other reddit.com sessions. We also recommend that you make use of a unique, [strong](http://xkcd.com/936/) password on any site you use. The most common way accounts on reddit get broken into is by attackers exploiting [password reuse](http://xkcd.com/1286/).

It is also strongly recommended, though not required, that you set an email address on your reddit account. If you were to ever forget your password, we cannot contact you to reset it if we don't have your email address. We do not sell or otherwise make your email address available to third-parties, as indicated in our [privacy policy](http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#p_13).


Stay safe out there.

**Edit:** A few people indicated that they had changed their passwords recently and wanted to know if they're now safe.  We addressed the server issue hours after it was disclosed on April 7th. The client-side leak was disclosed and addressed on April 9th. Our old certs were revoked by the 9th (all dates in PDT). If you have changed your password since April 9th, you're AOK.",Entertainment
announcements,Content Policy Update,"Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.",Entertainment
announcements,Bringing back the reddit.com beta program,"We're happy to announce that we're [bringing back](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/8t2th/weve_added_a_few_new_things_wed_like_you_test_on/) the reddit.com beta testing program. Anyone on reddit can opt-in to become a beta tester, and receive early access to reddit.com features before we launch them to everyone. 

We'll be using /r/beta as the community hub for the beta program, where we'll announce new beta features and give beta testers space to provide feedback.

There are two ways to participate in the beta program:

* If you're **logged in** to your reddit account, you can opt-in as a beta tester in your [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/), under ""beta options"". This will automatically subscribe you to /r/beta, so that you'll receive the latest information about new beta features. 
* If you're **logged out**, you can visit [beta.reddit.com](https://beta.reddit.com/) to see beta features. Note: you may end up back on www.reddit.com if you click on a link to reddit from somewhere else, like email or Twitter.

More details on the beta program, including how to give feedback on beta features, are on [this wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/wiki/index). Please note that not every feature will go to beta before launching - some changes may not need extensive beta testing, and we will continue to release some new features to [reddit gold](https://www.reddit.com/gold/about) members first. The best way to find out what's currently in beta testing is to check out /r/beta.

We hope our beta testers will be able to find issues and give feedback on new features before we launch them to everyone, so that we can continue to improve the quality of reddit.com for everyone.",Entertainment

That statement above was dropped in the middle of dinner. Unpromted. 

Before that little comments were said.

""Don't worry CoroBora, we'll pay since this is a pretty expensive place you probably didn't know.""...... Okay Man I picked it out and I invited you. 

""What happened to that last girl you were dating? Her name was Megan! Oh she was such a lady! She was so sweet and her hair was so gorgeous and tame."" - Megan is now a Michael and transitioned FtM. Okay so you don't like my natural wild afro

Food arrives and I ask for a bottle of wine, and a slice of my SO favorite dessert to be brought to the table, because my nerves need it for faking it through this and he was showing amazing restraint. I purposefully told my SO to be calm before dinner and let them run the show to see how they'll be. We talked about if it went sideways, that this is also his opportunity to cut ties with them if he chooses. So don't worry he's plenty protective, but I had him in off mode tonight lol. 

""I don't think it's wise to order that wine, and he doesn't need that cake. "" - well it ain't for you and he loves that cake. So he gets cake. 

My SO brings up a wedding we attended Via Zoom lol to lighten the mood and they made a face and.. our waiter came back with that wine at the right time and cake slice.. because you know once you open the bottle, pour, and sip it's on your tab. I only got one sip and I didnt even swallow it before that shit came out my mouth from what his parents said. ""If you have a child with my son in the future, we will not love them the same way we love our other grandchildren, because they will be half black. If marriage is in your cards with him forget it  I hope it doesn't last. We just believe that he would be happier with some one of a lighter tone of skin."" 

Our waiter hadn't even left the table so props to him for keeping that bottle steady while pouring after the bomb drop, but the face he made. His eyes wide as hell. 

All I did was look at my SO for him to just deflate, kiss my cheek, gathered his coat and my purse,  and he went to get the car without a word. It was painful for me to watch him  because I knew he was reall hurt, he loved his parents, but he didn't want to be apart of that anymore and even though we are not having children it's still a slap  to the face to hear that and disturbing. 

While I  sat there and looked at both his parents and wonder how the hell their son turned out so perfect.
I stood up because at this point, I realized I don't want to be on the same level as them, plus there is no reason to keep this quiet and if you wanna play ball like that you're going to be outed. ""For your son and I to even be in your presence is so offensive, having dinner with racist!! I cannot believe I thought you could be civil like a normal human being. I won't make that mistake again neither will he. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my time on you both and made an effort to meet you, while I could have instead treated us both to a much better dinner with company who is far superior and foward thinking than you two."" 
I picked this restaurant for a reason, it's expensive af and I had saved for this night because I had Intended on paying because  it's where we had our first lunch date and it also has that Raspberry dessert that my SO loves and I mainly wanted him to have that comfort tonight. 
""Since you so graciously offered to pay enjoy the bill and tip our black server the amount you would've tipped a Caucasian one. Because I now believe that your racism will play a part in how you tip him!"" I said this loudly and people turned their heads to look. His parents got red face, but I picked up the plate of cake and turned and walked to the door where my man was standing

I felt powerful 

I felt confident 

I felt extremely angry

I grabbed his hand 

And right when I walked out the door and it closed my legs shook, my breathing sped up, and I clung to him. We leaned on each other for support as we left and pulled off a few miles down the road to let  him have a moment to gather himself.

He broke the silence by asking for his cake. No utensils so we ate with our hands laughing, because I stole a plate from the restaurant, but he said I looked like a bad bitch doing it. After we were done we turned the car around, stopped at a bank to get a 50$, and went back to the restaurant  to return the plate and ask for our server.

It was a shit night, up until we were eating cake with our fingers on the side of the road laughing. We had known the night would have been bad, but we didn't know that those words would've been said. It has really been messing with me though.

TwoXChromosomes,For every person that believes they would never get an abortion,"I waited until I was 21 to have sex. Always used protection. Got married at 25 and immediately wanted to start a family.

We tried and tried and I never got pregnant. We got an IUI and yay I was pregnant! I heard the heart beat three times, I graduated from the infertility doctor to my OB. I planned our pregnancy announcement. We went in for our 12 week check, I sat in the ultrasound chair and held my husband’s hand. As the tech moved the wand around my stomach I could immediately tell something was wrong, there wasn’t much growth from the last time we had a scan. She said she’d be right back and disappeared, bringing back a doctor. 

As the doctor spoke I cried and when he left the room I screamed. It felt like my heart was torn in a million pieces. I was told to go home and I’d be given further instructions. My doctor called and told me she wanted me to come in for a D&C, which is the medical term for an abortion. She said it was for my own health that they recommend I do it that day. So that day I spent hours at the hospital and when I got home I wasn’t pregnancy anymore. 

I was told there was a genetic disorder. That even if I did give birth to a full grown baby they would likely not have survived or be extremely disabled and if I had waited I could have put myself through pain, extreme bleeding and risk of infection if my body “naturally” miscarried. 

When I tell people this story they often look uncomfortable and they should be. Because this is what we are being forced to do - because my choice is at risk of being taken away and my life is being put at risk by a bunch of clueless strangers who think they have a right to control my body. I never wanted  an abortion, no one does. We *need* them and the right to have medical procedures be discussed between me and my doctor, not me and a stranger.

I was so stunned I had to ask her again just to be sure. ""I'm sorry, did you say eligible or ineligible?""

TwoXChromosomes,I had a miscarriage on Wednesday. A pharmacist in MO refused to fill my medication.,"This week has been the hardest week of my life and I am not one to want to share these things, but I believe too many people are ignorant about what going through a miscarriage is actually like (including myself before this week).

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for almost a year. I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.

We were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.

On Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. ""And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.""

She just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.

The Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.

The Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.

The Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.

These are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. ""Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding."" It was all so confusing. ""Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness."" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.

And at the end she said ""When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage"".

Our hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.

I went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.

We went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.

The pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the ""dose was too high"". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.

To be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.

I bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.

And then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.

I can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.

I am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

I was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.

FUCK YOU to every single one of those people.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.

My details for the complaint and others to avoid this Walgreens

Address:  330 SW Ward Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64081

Time: June 23, 2022 at \~4:10 PM

There was only one pharmacist on staff at this time from my knowledge. With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.

The entire situation:

\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.

\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.

\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.

\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.

\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.

\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)

\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.

\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?

\- She did not respond or give any advice.

\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.

\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.

\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call. I told them about the situation, she was silent and said they were not going to fill it, and started working with me to get it figured out there.",Entertainment

TwoXChromosomes,I gave my boyfriend flowers to piss off his sexist uncle.,"My boyfriend's paternal uncle is very misogynist and old fashioned. He tries to berate my bf for not engaging in behaviours that fall into the realm of toxic masculinity. My boyfriend, being the strong and confident man that he is, either shuts him down or laughs his comments off. 



The uncle doesn't like me one bit. I'm guessing it's because I have a career, I'm 5 years older than my bf and like him, I never take any bs from the uncle. 


My boyfriend loves to cook. And when he's not travelling, he's the one who cooks for us. When the uncle got wind of this, he actually called my bfs dad and told him to ""get his son away from that harriden"" and that my boyfriend ""needs to start acting like a man."" 



A few months ago, bf and I were visiting his parents and the extended family, including toxic uncle were also there. I had gone out to get some stuff from the market, when I had an idea. I sent my bf a text letting him know that I would be bringing him flowers. He replied with ""got it. Say no more"". 



I later walked into the living room where everyone was sitting and loudly said to my bf, ""look honey I got you pink roses. I know they're your favorite"". My boyfriend stood up placed his hands over his face and said in a high pitched voice ""I love them! Thank you!"". 



You should've seen the uncle's face. He looked as though everything inside him was rebooting and trying to make sense of what he saw. He angrily looked at my bfs dad and said something like ""do you see what's going on here?"". Boyfriend's dad couldn't reply as he was bursting into laughter. As was everyone else. 



The uncle couldn't take it anymore. He just gave me a disgusted look and left the room. Since then my boyfriend's sister has affectionately labeled me the ""flower troll"". 



Neither my boyfriend nor I like to buy flowers. We both think they're a waste of money. However, using them to troll his uncle was worth every penny.

Instead, he tries turning it into a debate and says, ""well you hugged [other female coworker], you can hug me too! Come on, it is just a hug."" I have learned not to JADE from my Reddit use (thanks Reddit!) so I answer with ""I said 'no' and I meant it."" I then proceed try to walk passed him, ignoring anything else he says but he blocks my way.

He says he will hug me anyway. I stop trying to get passed him, look at him straight in his face and with a polite smile I tell him that no, he will not hug me against my will and if he does try to I will not only punch him in his face but that I will get away with it and he will end up the one fired. 

He gives me a confused look and just says ""No, you would get fired?"" Which is when the kitchen manager (who could overhear our conversation from the prep area) grabbed him, removed him from the time card area, and told him ""Noooo, she's right, you would get fired and she more than likely wouldn't even get a write-up."" I clocked out and left pleased with how I handled myself. 

This morning while I'm clocking in for my shift the kitchen manager asks if I have a second to talk. I say sure cause I'm a little early. He tells me he had a very quick conversation with the new cook about sexual harassment. He said because of the complete lack of understanding on this guys part, he called the owner and set up a mandatory company wide meeting with a specialist to go over not just sexual harassment but consent as well. He said if this guy gives me or anyone trouble to let him know. 

So I left work last night proud of how I handled myself and left today proud of how my employers are handling themselves. This is a meeting I'm actually looking forward to going to.

I recently went back to my doctors, who of course applauded the weight loss and wrongly assumed all of my problems were gone.

TwoXChromosomes,My ex wanted to throw away our relationship over my period. Yesterday I signed and bought his half of our house.,"Edit- I’ve been getting a lot of messages saying that I threw my relationship away too quickly over this.
If you feel that way, then you are welcomed to your opinion. Some things aren’t fixable to me and there’s no going back. To some it’s cheating or abuse.
While there was no physical abuse my boyfriend watched me be verbally abused. I gave him a choice and he took it. I will not explain this again through pms.

For those saying that I cleaned him out and was unfair during the split process- you only know a small part of my story guys. I spent a lot more money towards this house and I felt it was fair to keep it.
I did not take it from him as some are saying. I paid for his half and paid him for a little equity. He agreed to the number. If he didn’t we would of sold the house.
Also, I am not complaining about him taking our shared dishes. 
I was at work and when I came home 90% of my appliances and furniture was gone. My kitchen cabinets were empty, even all my baking stuff and he never baked. My couches were gone, lamps, etc.
So I’m not being petty over a few items.
I wouldn’t of minded him taking half of the stuff but it seems like they took items to just spite me. 
It was never my intention to not be fair with him or to bleed him dry. 

Edit- to all the threatening messages and garbage, you’re wasting your time. I really don’t care what an internet stranger has to say about my hygiene habits.

I’m glad this nightmare is coming to an end.
My boyfriend and I both owned our home 50/50 and his mooch best friend lived with us rent free.
I made a post on AITA a while ago and explained the situation in more detail. I don’t know how to link, but it’s in my post history.

His biggest issue with me was that I would throw away my wrapped (in tissue and a plastic bag to please him) tampons in the trash in the main bathroom where our shower is.
He was disgusting with this and didn’t want to compromise like I tried doing. I even got a different trash can with a tight lid. (There was never any visible blood or smell) he didn’t care.
He wanted me to use my private bathroom in my room. Because things like bleeding should be kept far away from him.

I always changed a tampon before baths/showers and the main bathroom was more convenient where it’s located in the house. Why would I go through the trouble to go to my half bath in my room. It’s my house? He doesn’t pay rent. He’s a guest.

Well my boyfriend took his side. His friend got worse and worse and became verbally abusive to me while my boyfriend watched and let it happen. 
He even tried to get him to kick me out of my own house.
Well I told him it was either me or his friend but his friend couldn’t stay with us anymore.
My boyfriend picked his friend and I ended the relationship. I told him that I’m putting the house for sale or I can buy him out. He couldn’t afford the house without me so yesterday I legally bought him out and I’m done with this headache. I can now dispose of my tampons however I wish. ❤️",Entertainment

TwoXChromosomes,"Trust your gut, always, even if it feels rude.","I was at a wedding being held at a hotel. I wanted to go back to my room, so I got on the elevator. A man jumped in with me at the last moment and got my attention. I pretended not to notice. When I got to my floor, I got off, and he got off with me and walked behind me in the same direction. I thought ""Oh, don't be silly, he is just a guest like you are"". When I got to my room, he paused, walked past me and stopped at the door next to mine, watching me. 

I finally realized he probably was planning to push me into my room when I opened the door. Instead of fishing out my key, I knocked on the door and waited. He also waited, pretending to fumble for a key. I knocked again, said ""GEORGE? Are you still in there?"". I sighed and went back toward the elevator, and the man followed me back. The doors opened, he got in, and I quickly backed out before the doors closed on him. 

I reported him to the front desk. I think my quick thinking saved my life or at least saved me from being assaulted.

No, he absolutely has to share with the only woman in the pool. And of course, every time we pass he has to graze his hand across my ass. 

Eventually, I told him if he couldn't keep his hands to himself, I'd either start hitting, or he could move to another lane. I was here first, and the only reason he came into this lane is that there's a woman here. Seriously, this is the worst lane.

I already have a toddler. I also take care of my dad, who’s starting chemo next week. So between all of that, I have to fly to another state to have an abortion. I can’t tell my boss why I’m leaving either because he would have the right to sue me. For no less than $10,000.

TwoXChromosomes,"I stood up to the kid at my school who kept asking me if he could ""eat me out""...","Two weeks ago I was sitting on the bus on my way home from school when a freshman (who a few weeks prior basically bludgeoned a classmate and was never caught for it) leaned toward me from across the isle, pulled out my headphones, and whispered... ""Can I eat you out?"" in my ear. At first I was simply shocked- I asked him what he said, he repeated the question, and then I told him to never ask me that question again. I sat on the bus feeling my face and hands grow hot and sweaty. I can't describe the feeling, but it sucked.

Well, I was in my art class last week when I walked across the room to ask my teacher a question. I had to bend down to pick something up that I had dropped, and the freshman and his friend happened to be sitting behind me (I'm a junior, but since this is an elective class, all grades can be mixed together). When I bent over I heard whispers, giggles, and dirty remarks coming from behind me. I immediately turned around and shot the boys a dirty look. Then, for the third time, he said... ""Hey, I know I already asked you this question, but can I PLEASE eat you out?"" At that moment my teacher turned around and asked me what my question was. As I talked to my teacher, I couldn't get those five words out of my head. I felt so angry and upset. I rehearsed my comeback in my head.

When I finished talking to my teacher, I leaned over, got uncomfortably close to the kid's face, and I yelled in my LOUDEST and BRAVEST voice: ""What the fuck is wrong with you? You're rude, disrespectful, and disgusting. NEVER ask me that question again. I'll get you expelled for that shit."" Immediately the whole class went completely silent, my teacher stared at me, and back to the freshman, and pulled me into the hallway to explain what happened. When I got into the hallway I broke down in tears, and my teacher sent me to the dean's office where I wrote a statement and received apologies and reassurance from administration. The freshman was suspended.

TwoXChromosomes,Please please please god vaccinate your kids,"I'm sitting alone drinking to much again and just need to get this off my chest. Three years ago I had a baby girl, her name was Emily and I loved her more than anything in this entire fucked up world. She was a mistake and I'd only been getting my shit together when I found out I was going to have her. I spent a long time thinking over whether or not I should have her or just abort her because I wasn't bringing her into a good place, but in the end I planned things out and did everything to make sure I could afford her and we wouldn't be living in poverty. I did everything I could for my baby with doctors visits and medicine and working a shit retail job at 8 months pregnant all by myself just so I could bring some happiness into my life. she was born in October and was so so beautiful. I'd messed up a few things in my life but I wasn't going to mess up with her if I could help it.


Then when she was 8 months old, too young yet for an mmr shot? she got sick. She was sick for a while and I'd never seen anything like it. I took her to the doctor. She was in the hospital and she looked so bad, she was crying and coughing and there was nothing I could do. I felt like the worst mother in the world. After I got her to the hospital she got worse, got something called measles encephalitis, where her brain was inflamed. I hadn't believed in god in years but you better believe I was praying for her every day.

She died in the hospital a week or so later. I held her little tiny body and wanted to jump off a bridge and broke down in the hospital. The nurses were sympathetic and I was, well I made a scene I'm pretty sure.


I found out later via facebook of fucking course that the neighbor I'd had watch my baby was an anti-vaxxer and had posted photos of her kid sick and other bullshit about how he was fine.

He was fine? He was FINE? My kid was DEAD because she made that choice. I went over and talked to her and she admitted he'd been sick when she'd had my kid last but didn't think much of it. I screamed at her. I screamed and yelled and told her the devil was going to torture her soul for eternity you god loving cunt because she took my baby from me. I'm sure I looked crazy, at the time maybe I was. I'm crying writing this now, and in my darkest moments I'd wished her kid was dead and it makes me feel worse.


I'd like to say I'm doing better but I'm really not. I'm alive, going day to day, trying to be the person I wanted to be for my kid even if my little Emily isn't here anymore. That's the only thing keeping me going anymore. I don't have anything else left.

Please vaccinate your kids, so other moms like me don't have to watch their baby die. It's not just your choice only affecting your kid, you are putting every child who for some reason hasn't gotten vaccinated in SO much danger. Please please please for the love of god please vaccinate.

I hope you live a long and happy life with people in it who love you and care for you and that you do not suffer like I did. I hope you are loved.**",Entertainment

TwoXChromosomes,"I was in a potentially dangerous situation today. I knew what to do from a previous post on here, and the comments I read, and I just want to say thank you.","It was recently announced that we are going back into lockdown, so we did a final window visit with my grandmother in a neighbouring city. I had to use the bathroom before our drive home, so I popped into a mall that was desolate even before Covid times, because I knew the bathroom was right in the entrance, down a hallway to the other side of the mall, but still visible from the front doors. Quick and easy. 

As I walked in, I passed a man in a yellow mask, leaning on the opposite side of a pillar in front of the entrance. I felt him turn towards me as I passed, but I carried on my way. 

I can’t explain why, but a post I had read on here suddenly popped into my head, about a woman who had avoided a man following her. The top comment I had read at the time said to never go into a public bathroom if followed. 

I passed the hallway into the main shopping center, and saw a dollhouse store to my left. I remembered another comment saying that if you aren’t sure whether or not you are being followed, to go into a store that the suspected person would not typically have interest in. Instinct took over, and I turned toward it.

There was no one at the counter, so I chose a section of miniatures to admire, all the while eyeing the man in the yellow mask. He casually made his way into the store, and came to a stop at the same section, a few feet from me, but looking in my direction. 

As the realization sunk in, I fought back paralyzingly fear, and reached for my phone in my pocket. I turned abruptly, and quickly walked back toward the exit as the phone ran for my husband, who was waiting out in the car for me. 

The man in the yellow mask turned and matched my pace toward the exit.

I can’t explain the mixed feeling of fear, knowing the man was almost grabbing distance behind me now, and relief, when the call connected, and I heard my safe person on the other end of the line. 

With the phone on speaker, I loudly said, “I am being followed by the man behind me,” and without missing a beat, my husband was out of the car and assured me he was coming. 

I can’t find the post, or remember the usernames of the people who’s advice I followed, but thank you. Had it not have been for reading that post recently, I don’t know that I would have had the foresight, or awareness in the moment to know to not go into that bathroom.",Entertainment
TwoXChromosomes,I had no idea how badly transwomen were treated until I started getting mistaken for a trans woman.,"I’m in my late twenties and working in healthcare right now. 

I was born a woman, but I enjoy looking androgynous, so I have short hair, and I work out, so I have a muscular build. I also have a deep voice for a woman. I LOVE looking androgynous and don’t feel bad about it. I also have a gender neutral name. 

In the past year, people have begun mistaking me for a trans woman. 

— I went to a doctor’s appointment. The doctor (female) asked me my pronouns. I said, “She/her.” The doctor began referring to me exclusively as male. She gave me some bad news and I began crying and hugging my husband (who was attending the appointment with me). She became extra shitty and asked me to stop and hurry up so she could get on with the appointment. I assumed that the doctor was just an asshole… I later found out she marked on my intake forms that I was MTF (male to female transgender). At the time, I had no idea what was going on, but afterwards, I realized she was trying to misgender by referring to me as male and was being shitty because she was transphobic. 

— I had to stay overnight in the hospital. I told them I was a woman. They tried to put me in a room with a dangerous male psych patient. I explained that, per hospital policy, I shouldn’t be housed with a male roommate. They insisted I “had to be” because I was “technically biologically male.” I explained, no, I was born a woman. This is so fucked up to me— what if I was a trans woman? Why the fuck would they be putting a female-presenting trans woman in a room with a dangerous male psych patient? 

— I have been called a faggot. 

— A male patient at the nursing home commented on how he could see my erection through my pants. I had to explain that I do not have an erection because I was born female. Even if I did have a dick, why the hell is this man commenting on my genitals? 

There’s more, but I don’t want to go through it all. 

Anyway, solidarity for my trans sisters. Y’all have it rough. Genuinely baffled people think it’s okay to call me a faggot, be shitty to me during doctor’s appointments, and talk about my genitals.

Please, I am so tired and just need a hug.","I tried to find a subreddit to post to that could be defined as ‘welcoming’ and ‘comforting’. In hopes that it would be okay I be allowed to post. And when I thought of safe, this subreddit was the first to come to mind.

—

My dad died less than 12 hours ago from COVID.

He started feeling poorly on Monday. He got ill, began stumbling, on Thursday. I had my mom call an ambulance and he was diagnosed that night. Less than 24 hours later, they called a code blue and he died. He had COPD, heart issues (previous quad bypass), and was 80 years old. 

As soon as he tested positive, I knew the odds were that he wasn’t going to make it. You know the odds when you work in a hospital. 

I work at a hospital (team lead for breast and gynecological oncology department). I have patients pass away due to cancer all the time. COVID has been there too. Surgeries cancelled. Chemo delayed due to exposure. Patients who die from it. My dad just died from it. My dad died. My dad..

Whenever I get a phone call from a patient’s family member, letting us know that a patient has died, I stuff that set of emotions in a box. I have to be strong for them and listen to them as their voice breaks. I have to comfort them. And when we find out from the grapevine that a patient passed, I put those feelings in that box too. The box feels full when a patient passes that you’re close with. That maybe you saw their progression and spent time with them.. and then they are gone. That box gets really full.

I don’t have many friends. I don’t have anyone outside of my spouse (and mother) to talk to. I posted on Facebook in effort to find someone to talk to, but my brother (half, older) got upset and told me to take it down. That his kids were out and driving around and he didn’t want them to see it before he got to talk to them. I posted it to my Twitter (private) but he saw it and called, cussing, telling me to take it down. I took it down.

So I’m here. I only meant to write two or three sentences but the words started tumbling out. I’m sorry for whoever sat through and read all of this. I didn’t mean to make it so long. I just. I can’t sleep and my dad died and I’m so tired of COVID. I’m so, so sick and tired of COVID. I love my job but the work has been exhausting and taxing since March. I love my hospital but it’s been so, so tiring to be in that building every shift.

My dad died and I feel alone and I just hope it is okay I post this here.

Thank you for your time. This subreddit is amazing and I love reading how supportive everyone is. It gives me faith and hope. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

_Note_ - Thank you everyone who had helped my mom earlier. She was sobbing on the phone. Total strangers she said. I did not know that fundraising was not allowed here. I am so sorry. I deleted my moms GoFundMe link but if you can still help, please - it is on their main website under reddit covid and I made a post on the assistance subreddit with a link like the mod suggested. And again, I’m sorry for breaking the rules. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Edit, 8:43AM, EST: I’m still here and.. want to be here. I’m so glad that out of the subreddits that I was trying to figure out to post to - this was the one. My brother asked me to at least wait 24 hours to post anything on social media. We are in isolation/quarantine, so I’m staying between my spouse, toddler, my close family by text, and on here. Internet strangers who are so much more than that. I know I cannot reply to every single person - but I am reading everything posted and its making the heavy weight on my chest a little less heavy. Thank you all - so, so much.

Edit, 12:52PM, EST: I am at a loss for words with all these comments of kindness. My spouse and me just did our COVID test. I am going to try and sleep for an hour or two. I have tunnel vision and my ears are ringing. I think I may be in shock again. Or something similar. Everyone here is amazing. I just. **I love you all.**

**Edit, 4:07PM, EST:** Again, I am sorry that I posted the GoFundMe link. I didn’t know I was breaking the rules. If anyone knows where I can fundraise to help my mom, please send me a message. I’ll do anything for her. I did post on r/assistance like the mod suggested (the post is probably easiest found under my user page). I just know if I post to Twitter or Facebook, it would upset my brother. If he even knew I was doing a fundraiser, he would be upset. And.. thank you beyond words to everyone whose been here for me today. Been there for my mom today. For everything. I am still trying to reply here and there. This whole day has been so many emotions. I love you guys so, so much.",Entertainment

TwoXChromosomes,That time my dad prohibited me to get my upper leg waxed,"My mom was never much of a ""let's do things together!"" Which was fine but also sucked when it came to me wanting to try things such as manicures, waxing, bra shopping and what not. However, I had a great dad who was always willing to bring me to these things, so I never felt like I missed out on those things. He'd often drop me off and then pick me up or something. 

When I was 16, right around prom time, I decided that I wanted to wax my legs. I mean, I obviously didn't want to have missed spots and I wanted my legs to be smooth and whatnot. My dad was very hesitant. He first said no, not yet, but as prom was approaching I became more and more insistent and he just said fine, that he'd do some research and book an appointment. 

As usually, he held his word and a few days later, I had an appointment with the sweetest waxer I'll probably ever meet. My dad has ONE condition: no upper legs. We convinced him to do a couple inches from my knees, because... Dresses and skirts, but not more than that. 

So that was a little over a decade ago. I continues going to her for a while and then I moved. Summer is here and I booked an appointment with her this morning. After all the catch up we did (a good 5 years!) she said she had to tell me something. 

She told me that before my first appointment, my dad had called her and booked an appointment for himself. He spoke to her about her techniques and whatnot. He requested a full leg shave and she was happy to oblige. After he was done, he told her that he really didn't enjoy any of it but that his 16 year old daughter wanted to her her legs waxed and that he wanted to try it first. He booked an appointment for me that very same day. However, the waxer says that he called the very next day saying he had bruising on his upper legs and that it hurt. The waxer said it was possible and somewhat common, so he vetoed the upper leg for me.

O.M.G. The thing is, this is exactly like my dad. It's something he would do and it's something he'd probably never ever tell me he did. It was just another reminder of how thoughtful he is and always was.

nosleep,My sugar daddy asks me for weird favors,"His Tinder profile said he was 45, but he looked to be in his early thirties at most. 

*Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.* 

It sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. 

**Hey, there sweetheart :)**

I cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. 

**Hey ;)** 

His name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. 

After a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn’t a dream. 

**You still there?** 

I clicked on the message. 

**Yeah. Sorry. If you don’t mind me asking, what are you looking for in return?** 

I stared at the chat until he replied. 

**I’m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**

That sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. 

**Like what?**

**For example, the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** 

That sounded innocent enough, but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn’t that naive. 

**From the post office or something?** 

**No.  I’ll send you the address, but I’d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**

Kik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. 

**I’m not home right now, but there’s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** 

I grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. 

**Got it! Omw.** 

My phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. 

**I’m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** 

I thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. 

The house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. 

“You here for Jack’s shit?”

I looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. 

“Uh, yeah. I guess.” I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. 

“Stay right there.” He said. 

I did. I actually don’t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. 

A few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. 

“Can you open your car?” He asked. 

I opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. 

“Alright, there you go.” He said. 

“Thanks.” I replied. 

I walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. 

“Oh, and one more thing!” He said. 

I looked at him. 

“Watch out.” He said. 

I didn’t reply. 

I blasted my music as I drove to Jack’s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn’t. 

I parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. 

It was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. 

I opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. 

I thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. 

I walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. 

I set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. 

In my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. 

**Don’t answer any calls that aren’t from Marvin.** 

I put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. 

I walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. 

*Incoming call from Jack.* 

That was odd. 

I grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn’t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. 

I’ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack’s house. He had me meet one of his “employees” at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.

In total, I’ve made around $3500. 

Most recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. 

**I need you to spend the night at my house.** 

I hadn’t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. 

I drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. 

Everything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. 

I wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. 

*Lock the door when you come in.* 

*Only answer calls from Marvin.* 

*Don’t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* 

*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* 

*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* 

*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*

*I’ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*

I made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I’d be perfectly fine. 

Still, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?

Nevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that’s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. 

I checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn’t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. 

I had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. 

*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* 

I stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. 

“It’s the police! Open up.” 

I didn’t move. 

“Hello? It’s the police! Open up or we’re coming in.”

I still didn’t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. 

There was silence for a while after that. 

Then the doorbell rang again. 

“Hey, it’s Jack! Let me in!”

It sounded like Jack, but still, I didn’t get up. He would have a key, wouldn’t he? Why would he need me to let him in?

This continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn’t respond. 

I was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. 

When I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. 

I stopped at the entrance and peered in. 

It was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. 

“Hey! Good morning!” He said when he saw me. 

“Hi.” I replied, nervous. 

I hadn’t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. 

“Scrambled eggs?” He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. 

“Yeah, thanks!” I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. 

I ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. 

“So how was it?” He asked. 

“It was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.” I replied. 

“Cool!” He replied.

There was an awkwardness in the room. 

“I think I’m gonna go now. I have class…” I trailed off. 

I didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. 

“Oh, no! Yeah, sure! I’ll talk to you some other time.” He replied. 

I grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. 

When I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

I stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. 

Beside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. 

It was the $1000 payment. 

I looked at my phone and then back at the list. 

Maybe it wasn’t an important step?

As I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. 

**I’m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you’re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**

I stared at the message and read it again. 

And again. 

And once more for good measure. 

**I’m not in town right now.** 

I thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. 

**I’m not in town right now.** 

Within minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn’t recognize. 

**Did you forget to do something? ;)**

The text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. 

I didn’t respond. 

Next came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. 

It was followed by another text. 

**Watch out.**

nosleep,My wife has been peeking at me from around corners and behind furniture. It's gone from weird to terrifying,"

My wife ""Lynn"" and I have been together for six years and married for 11 months. Our entire history together has been very normal and never once have I noticed any weird behaviors or red flags. I can't stress enough how out of character this whole thing is for her.  



Lynn is very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. She's always been the no nonsense type of person. Being childish, or trying to scare me is not something she'd normally do. 



She doesn't even like watching horror movies. When we first started dating she agreed to watch The Shining with me because she knew how much I loved horror. She was so scared that she didn't even make it through half of the movie before we had to turn it off. She isn't into anything creepy, and has never been into pranks. It's just not her cup of tea. And that's fine. But that's what was so strange about this. It's just so unlike her. 




I should also add that she never had any mental health issues and as far as I'm aware it doesn't run in her family. I know some people are able to hide their mental health problems, but in the six years we've been together I think I'd have seen some sort of sign. 



Two months ago, I was in the kitchen making myself some coffee before work. I was running a bit late that morning and knew I wouldn't be able to make it to Dunkin Donuts for my usual morning fix. 

I took a sip of my coffee as I hurried down the hall towards the front door, when I happened to notice Lynn peeking at me from around the corner ahead of me. I could only see her eyes, and a  strand of her long dark hair hanging against the wall. The rest of her body was concealed behind the corner. I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw her. I did burn the shit out of my lips. 



""Geeze, Lynn."" I said, wiping a few drops of coffee from my pants. ""You scared the shit out of me."" 

She immediately popped out of view like a little kid that had been caught. I heard her scurry off towards the living room, and by the time I got to the front door she was out of sight. 



It was really weird, and just totally out of character for her like I said, but I also found it kind of funny that she was being more playful and a little less serious. I shouted that I loved her, and called her a weirdo. As I shut the door behind me I heard her laughing.



Her behavior was a bit odd, but it certainly wasn't something to call a priest over. I forgot about it by lunch and by the time I got home she was her normal self. I didn't bring it up and neither did she, and life went on. 



The next incident happened three days later. It was around 2am and I had woken up to get a drink. I was standing at the kitchen island, jug of Oj in hand, when I felt a strong feeling that I was being watched. 



For whatever reason I looked down at the floor and saw my wife's smiling face staring back. She was peeking at me from the other side of the island, staring up at me with wide unblinking eyes and grinning. Grinning like the Cheshire cat. 



 I screamed, I'll admit it. Not out of irritation but fear. For some reason at that moment I was scared. 


At the sound of my scream Lynn scuttled backwards out of my view, her hands and feet smacking the tile floor as she hurried out of the kitchen on all fours.  I didn't run after her, or even yell after her. I just stood there frozen in shock, wondering what fuck had possessed her to do that.



 It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to go back upstairs, but I eventually did. When I got to our bedroom, Lynn was lying on her side, asleep. Or at least pretending to be. I stood there for a while, watching her breathing to be sure she really was asleep. 


I had the feeling she might jump out at me the moment I got into bed. But she didn't. I climbed into bed and she didn't even move. Her breathing was soft and deep and I was starting to wonder if I'd dreamt the whole thing. 



The next morning I waited for her to come down for coffee and after handing her a mug and kissing her cheek I decided to ask her about it. 



""What was that about last night?"" I asked, keeping my tone light so I didn't offend or embarrass her. 



She frowned over her cup of coffee, shaking her head like she had no clue what I was referring to. 



""You were peeking at me again. From over there."" I said, pointing to the spot on the floor by the kitchen island.  



She followed my gaze, and when she looked back at me she burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that I couldn't help but join her. 



""You creep me the fuck out sometimes, you know that?"" I said. She giggled and set her cup on the counter and wrapped her arms around my neck. 



""You creep me out all the time. So I guess we're even."" She teased.



We said our goodbyes and left for work. As I drove I kept thinking about how creepy it had been seeing her grinning at me from behind the island like that. The sounds her hands made on the floor as she crawled away. I told myself she was just trying to be silly. Just trying to join me in my love of all things horror…. 


 It's not like I was afraid of her. But it still didn't sit right with me. 


I started seeing her peeking at me more and more. Sometimes she'd be peeking out from behind the couch or living room curtains. Once she even managed to get inside her grandmother's old trunk that sits at the foot of our bed. 

I might not have even known she was there at all had the trunk's old hinges not given her away. 


She'd had the lid propped up just enough so that  only half of her face peeked through. She'd been grinning like an excited toddler. It was unnerving. I didn't even know what to say to her. All I could do was stare. When I finally found my voice, I asked her why on earth was she doing this. She didn't answer, but she had slowly closed the lid, shutting herself inside the trunk. I just walked away, feeling disturbed.  


I didn't understand why she was doing it, but it clearly made her happy. I just hoped she would tire of the game quickly. 


Lynn didn't peek at me for the next two weeks. I started to think she was done with her weird prank and I was relieved. We were watching a show on Netflix one night and I jokingly said that I hadn't seen her peeking at me lately, and that she must have given up on her spy game. She looked up at me with a small smile and said, ""Maybe I've just gotten better at it."" 


I didn't say anything but I wondered whether or not she was joking.



For the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. Was she still peeking at me when I wasn't looking and I just hadn't noticed? And if so, what the hell was she getting out of this? I started to feel paranoid, constantly checking whether she was watching from around the corner, or behind a door.  I was jumpy whenever I was home and she wasn't in full view of me. I felt stupid and a little crazy. 


But after a few weeks without another incident, I began to relax.  I stopped checking behind furniture and walls and told myself it was just a bad memory. 



Then a few days ago things got so much worse....


Lynn left to go to a friend's, and I lounged on the couch and played a couple games on my laptop. 


Around 9pm I hopped in the shower and as I was washing the soap from my hair, I felt that awful feeling that I was being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and almost had a fucking heart attack. 



Lynn was peeking from behind the shower curtain, her entire head stretched into the shower, leaving just her body outside. Her long dark hair hung against the curtain, the ends dripping with water. Her mouth hung open in a terrible grin, eyes wide and red, as if she hadn't blinked in a while. I screamed and jumped back against the wall. She didn't move nor did her smile waver. Her makeup ran down her cheeks in two black streaks. She looked giddy and completely deranged. I was fucking terrified. 


 

We stood like that for a few moments, neither of us saying a word. Finally after what felt like forever, she slowly pulled her head back out of the shower, and I watched her blurry figure  through the curtain as she moved backwards towards the bathroom door. 



A second later the bathroom door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the mirror. I screamed again, and jumped out of the shower to lock the door. I stayed inside the bathroom for over an hour. Maybe I overreacted to some of you. But joke or not, I wasn't going to put up with the crazy shit anymore. That's what I kept telling myself as I paced in my bathroom, stopping to listen at the door every few minutes. 



Suddenly I heard a muffled sound, and I pressed my ear against the bathroom door, straining to listen. I couldn't hear anything but I envisioned Lynn standing on the other side of the door, giggling at her joke. 


I felt a surge of anger. I was beyond pissed at being made to feel scared in my own house, and made to hide in the bathroom for an hour. All for what? Some joke? If it was a joke it was an awful one. 



""What the fuck Lynn!"" I snapped. ""This shit is getting really fucking annoying."" I waited for her to apologize, or to call me a jerk. But instead I heard a faint moan, so quiet I wondered if I heard it at all, and then complete silence. 



""Lynn?"" I called out, not able to even hide the shakiness in my voice. I got no response. Just my own heavy breathing. 



""I swear to God, just fucking stop it!"" I yelled, pounding my fist on the door. 


I waited for her to cuss me out, something I would expect from me talking to her like that. I never screamed at her before. 


But there was nothing. Just the occasional drip from the shower head. 




I won't deny that I was scared. Too afraid to open the damn door and face my own wife. I waited another 30 minutes or so, which feels like a fucking lifetime when you're scared. Finally I decided I wasn't going to spend the night hiding in my bathroom, so I got down on my knees and peered under the door. I almost expected to see her face peeking back at me but thankfully I didn't. I could see straight down the hallway to the top of the stairs, but no Lynn. I didn't know if I should be happy about that or not. I looked for a few minutes, waiting to see her head pop up over the top step, but it never came. 



I stood up, my hand hovering over the door and mentally prepared myself to open it. I slowly turned the lock with shaky fingers, and was about to yank it open when I heard a sound that still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it. 



A moan, louder than before, but this time I was able to tell just where it was coming from. I turned my head to the closet door as if in slow motion, and locked eyes with my wife who was peeking out at me from the slight gap.  



Her eyes were still wide as ever and her mouth was hanging open in the most grotesque gaping smile I'd ever seen. I didn't even scream. I was too scared for even that. Her hands were clasped to her chest, body trembling with sheer delight, as if she could barely contain her excitement. A short raspy moan bubbled up from her throat, deep and raw, sending a shiver through my entire body. 



Somehow I found the ability to pull the bathroom door open and ran as fast as I could all the way down the steps, snagging my keys and phone from the table in the living room before running outside to my car. I could hear her shrill laughter behind me but I didn't hear her getting closer. I didn't bother shutting the front door. I drove away from the house faster than I legally should have, shivering the entire time, either from fear or the cold. Maybe a little of both. I hadn't grabbed a coat or even a pair of shoes. I was still in my boxers and my hair was still damp. 



I drove straight to my brother Chris's house about 40 minutes away, ignoring any and every call and text I got. I didn't check my phone until I was safely parked in my brother's driveway. Lynn had called 4 times and sent a flurry of texts, all wondering where I'd gone and why I left ""like that."" 




I threw my phone at the dash in a rage, furious at her nonchalant attitude. My brother and his wife were surprised to see me, especially dressed in just a pair of boxers, but told me to stay as long as I needed. Chris lent me some clothes and asked me what happened. I told him Lynn and I had a fight, but didn't get into the details. I didn't want him to think I was overreacting, leaving my wife over a prank, even if it was a strange one. I mean, hadn't I encouraged her for years to lighten up instead of being so serious all the time? I had wanted her to relax and loosen up, but this was definitely not what I'd had in mind.  


 


I tried to sleep on their sofa, but my brain wouldn't let me sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I saw Lynn's face staring at me from inside the closet. Knowing she'd been in there with me the entire time made my skin crawl. She'd never left the fucking bathroom at all. Instead she slipped inside the closet and slammed the bathroom door shut to fool me. 



The mere thought of going back home gave me anxiety. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chris ended up giving me a sleeping pill so I was able to get a little rest. My sleep was filled with terrible dreams. All of Lynn's smiling face. 



I woke up just as the sun started to rise. My sore body ached from the sofa, and I felt drained. I knew I'd have to call Lynn at some point, but I didn't know what to say to her. I wouldn't be going home unless she gave me her word she'd never do anymore creepy shit. 


I just wanted my wife back. Her normal serious self never looked so good to me. 



I was contemplating calling her and telling her that, when that familiar feeling came over me. I was being watched. I was staring at the ceiling, my heart in my throat. I didn't want to look away but the longer I ignored the feeling the worse it got. 



My eyes drifted away from the ceiling almost on their own. Her face was pressed up against the window beside the couch, staring down at me with that same gaping smile. Drool dribbled down her lips, leaving two long streaks down the glass. I didn't know how long she'd been there, but something told me she'd been there quite a while, possibly all night. 



I didn't bother screaming, though I was afraid anger trumped any fear I felt at that moment. I jumped up from the couch and pounded my palm against the glass. 

""Lynn! Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong with you? Just go home!"" I shouted. ""Now!"" 

She didn't move, and her ghastly expression never changed. If anything her smile only grew, as if she had never been more elated. 



I could hear Chris and his wife moving around upstairs. As if Lynn could hear them from her place outside, her head twitched slightly in their direction, and she began to close her mouth slowly. 


Chris called my name from upstairs, obviously concerned. I turned to see him and his wife Rebecca hurrying down the steps. When I turned back to the window Lynn was gone. The only sign she'd been there at all was the two streaks of drool still dripping down the glass. 



I tried explaining to Chris and Rebecca about waking up to see Lynn watching me through their window. They were skeptical, who wouldn't be? Chris and I went outside to the spot in front of the window but there were no footprints in the dirt, just a slight indent. Animal probably, Chris guessed, and I didn't argue. He and Rebecca assumed I dreamt the entire episode but they didn't understand, and I was too tired to explain it to them.  




I called out of work that day and turned my cell off. I didn't want to face Lynn. Just talking to her was too much for me at that point. I really started to believe something was irreversibly wrong with her. That no matter what promises she made we'd never be the same again. The thought saddened me to my core. I cried most of the morning. By noon I figured I was ready to confront her. Give her one last chance to explain herself. I could at least give her that after 6 years I told myself. I turned my phone on and saw the dozens of texts she'd sent, all from a seemingly concerned wife. 



""Can we talk?""



""I love you.""



""Please call me."" 



""I'm really worried.""



""Can you answer?"" 



""Just come home.""




And more of the same. All texts telling me she loved me, and she wanted me home. How worried she was….Not a damn one addressing the crazy shit she pulled. Like she hadn't been acting like a character from a Stephen King book. 


Even her texts were different. She normally texted novels just to tell me to pick up a loaf of bread! You'd think she'd have more to say to me after her bizarre shenanigans. 




I know it probably seems childish to some of you who are miles away from this situation. But if you saw the way Lynn had looked at me, how she scampered away on all fours like some wild animal, grinning at me from inside the closet like a lunatic…..then I think you'd find my reaction was warranted. 



I ended up staying with Chris and Rebecca for another night. I didn't wake up yesterday until after noon, and thankfully I didn't see Lynn's face watching me through the window. 



""I don't want to pry, because it's not my place. But is this fight something that can be mended?"" Rebecca asked. She'd made us both a sandwich for lunch and I knew she wanted to breach the subject without seeming to be nosy. 



""I don't know. I just….. She's like a different person."" I said, choosing my words carefully. I still wasn't ready for her or Chris to know the full extent of the bat shit craziness I had been dealing with.



""People change Ben. But she's still the same woman you married. Maybe you both just need to talk through your issues. Whatever's going on, I'm sure it can be fixed."" She said, ever the peacemaker. 



""I think it's beyond that now. I don't think talking would help. I just don't trust her."" I said. The words stung in my heart. I missed and loved my wife. But how could I live with someone like that? Living in constant fear didn't sound too appealing. 



""Lynn loves you. She has to be absolutely crushed."" She said.  



""I don't know about that."" I said. 



""Well she certainly seemed like it to me. I've never seen her so upset. Very much unlike the Lynn I know."" Rebecca said, shaking her head sadly. 



It took a full minute for her words to really sink in and when they did, I felt dread worming its way through my skin. 



""Wait. What do you mean? You saw her? You saw Lynn?"" I asked, my mouth suddenly dry. 



Rebecca nodded casually as if that fact wasn't nightmare fuel. Maybe for her it wasn't. 



""She stopped by this morning just after Chris left for work.""  She said, cleaning the plates from the table. ""I didn't see her car though. Maybe she took an uber or something."" 



""Becc. What did she say? Did..did she come inside?"" I asked, sweat starting to break out on my forehead. I began looking around, examining corners as though a predator lurked behind them. 



""No. She just asked if you were awake yet and I said that you weren't. I asked if she wanted me to wake you but she said no. Just said to let you sleep."" She said as she washed the dishes. 



""That's all? She didn't say anything else?"" I asked. 



""No. She looked awful though. Like she hadn't slept in days. I think you should call her.""



I got up from the table and thanked Rebecca for lunch. 


I felt a little bit better at the knowledge that at least she hadn't come inside. Still, I needed to double check that the doors were locked. 




I sat for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I didn't want to go home, but I felt that I owed it to Lynn to help her if I could. Hadn't I swore an oath to love and honor her through sickness and in health? Clearly she was very sick. 




If she was sick, which I truly believed she was, I had to try and get her the help she needed. But I didn't even know where to start. I didn't want to call the police, and besides, what the hell was I going to tell them? That my wife was peeking at me? That she was being creepy? As bizarre as she'd been, she still hadn't committed any crime. Not yet anyway. The police would have probably said that I was overreacting. But this wasn't some prank. It felt wrong. Dangerous even. Like something sinister lurked beneath her smile.



I knew as her husband I was well within my rights to have her committed, but what if she simply acted normal in their presence? She'd obviously been able to fool Rebecca into thinking she was just a concerned wife. As long as the doctors didn't find her a danger to herself or others, they'd have no choice but to release her after 72 hours. I felt lost and overwhelmed. 



So I did what any husband in my position would do.


I called her mother.


I didn't want to, believe me. 

Her mother, Marianne and I were never on the best of terms. We'd never fought or anything like that. 

She just wasn't a very warm person, and wasn't really easy to get along with.  She hardly ever smiled and when she did, only her lips would move into a thin lipped smile, leaving her eyes as blank as before. She gave off this aura that felt like she was permanently on the offensive. 



I'd only met her twice and both times were for such short visits. I got the impression she didn't approve of me for her daughter. Lynn always ushered us out quickly, as she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable which I was grateful for. Being in her mother's company felt almost unbearable. Like walking on glass. I was glad when we moved three states away so we didn't have to see her often. I was happy to avoid the woman, but I needed her help.  



I really didn't want to talk to her at all but I had to talk to someone and someone who knew Lynn better than I did. So I grit my teeth and did what I had to. 



""Yes?"" She answered, already sounding irritated. 



""Marianne, it's me Ben. Do you have a minute to talk?"" I asked. I could hear her cluck her tongue in irritation. 



""I'm in the middle of writing some checks, but if you insist, I suppose I can spare a moment. What is it that you want to discuss Benjamin?""  She said, coolly? 



""It's about Lynn. She's been... acting strangely and I was wondering if you had any idea whether there was something - "" I was quickly interrupted. 



""It's a bit difficult to follow your rambling Benjamin, what is that you want from me?"" She asked. I could almost see her standing there in her thin sweater and slacks, tapping her fingernails impatiently on the table. 



""I wanted to know if you'd ever noticed any odd behavior? Or possibly any mental health issues?"" I asked. There was a long, uncomfortable pause  that I couldn't tell was because she was just thinking, or ….something else. Finally after a few seconds she spoke. 



""I'm not sure if this is one of your jokes Benjamin, but if so I don't find the humor in it. Now I do have business to attend to as I've said,  so if you don't mind -"" she said, but I cut her off before she could get rid of me. 



""Marianne, it's not a joke. I'm sincerely concerned about Lynn's mental health. Her behavior has been very erratic lately. I'm very worried about her and I figured as her mother you would be as well."" I said, my frustration evident in my voice. 



""If you're truly concerned then I suggest you get the health professionals involved. I don't know what you expect of me."" She snapped. I could tell she was seconds away from hanging up and for some reason I was desperate not to let her. I had the feeling that she knew a lot more than she was letting on. 



""Please. If not for me, do it for Lynn."" I tried. 



I heard a faint shaky intake of breath, as if she were trying to hold her steely persona together but failing. 



""Marianne? What's wr-""  I started. 



""Benjamin, I don't know what to tell you. My only advice would be to seek professional help. Do not call here again. Goodbye."" I tried to call out to her but she'd hung up. 



I tried to wrap my head around the call and her refusal to help me. Even if she didn't like me, why wouldn't she want to help her own daughter? I couldn't understand that. I tried to replay the conversation, desperate to find something I missed.


 After a while I almost gave up, until I remembered her last last words to me. 'Seek professional help' she'd said those words with a bit of urgency. I could have just been grasping at straws but no, I was sure her voice had changed ever so slightly when she'd said that. As if they were very important.




What had she meant? I assumed she'd been referring to medical professionals, but maybe she was referring to someone else. Someone that she didn't, for some reason, feel comfortable saying directly. Or maybe I was just desperate. 



I waited for Chris to get home and after a very long and exhausting conversation with him and Rebecca, I convinced them that Lynn truly needed psychiatric help. I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't prepared to go into it yet, but I told them about our last encounter. How she'd hidden in the bathroom, peeking at me from the closet. 


They were obviously shocked but thankfully they believed me. They too just wanted to help her. Still they didn't think it was all that serious. Weird, maybe but not dangerous. They just kept saying that Lynn had to be playing some kind of weird joke. ""Maybe for YouTube?"" Rebecca offered, if only half-heartedly. 



Chris didn't think we should involve the police just yet. He offered instead to go with me, and I readily accepted. He reasoned that calmly talking to her, trying to coax her into going willingly was the best recourse. I agreed to do it his way. At least I wouldn't be going into that house alone. 



We drove over this morning, just after breakfast. There was no way I was going at night. When we pulled into the driveway my stomach began doing somersaults. Her car wasn't there, but I still didn't let my guard down. 



The front door was ajar, and for a split second I thought we'd see her eyes staring through the gap. I was shaking and starting to sweat. Chris however was fine. He waited for me to open the door, his hands in his pockets like he was going on a fucking stroll through the park. I envied his ignorance.



I pushed the door open and was immediately hit with the stench of rot. Chris smelled it too, and he walked in the house behind me with his nose scrunched up. 


""What do you guys use to clean the floors around here, shit?"" Chris mumbled. 


""Shut up."" I said, my eyes darting around for any signs of Lynn.



The house was deadly quiet and dark despite being 10 in the morning. All the curtains were closed up tight, refusing to allow any sunlight inside. If I hadn't left it just two days prior I'd have thought the house to be abandoned. 


We moved through each room, carefully checking any place that she might hide, occasionally calling her name. 



""Why the fuck are you looking under the couch?"" Chris asked eventually. ""Aren't we looking for your wife?""  He was looking at me like I was a moron. 



""Let's just go upstairs."" I whispered. He shook his head but followed me up the stairs to check the bathroom and spare bedroom. On the way up my shoes crunched over pieces of glass that looked to be littered over a few of the steps. 



I noticed that one of Lynn and my wedding portraits that hung on the wall along the staircase had been smashed. The frame hung crookedly, all the glass removed. I stared at the picture, a lump forming in my throat. We had taken the photo just after leaving the church, after saying our vows. She looked so beautiful in her white gown. I looked at Lynn's beautiful face. I never dreamed her face would ever be a source of terror for me.  



We climbed the rest of the steps and checked the spare bedroom, but it looked completely untouched. 


I was hesitant to go into the bathroom, my fear from that night coming back to me all at once. Chris noticed, and offered to go in by himself but I couldn't let him do that. So we walked in together, checking the closet and the shower. The bathroom looked as if it hadn't been touched since the night I left. 



""I don't think she's here Ben. Why don't you pack some clothes and we'll try coming back tomorrow or something."" Chris said. I nodded and went into our bedroom and shoved some clothes into a duffle bag. When I checked inside our closet I came across the source of the smell and gagged. 


Chris took one look and lost all color in his face. He had to go stand by the stairs to get away from the sight and smell. 



 I gazed down in shock at what lay Inside my bedroom closet. Soaking into the rug, were at least a dozen eyeballs, all carefully laid out in pairs. Some were as large as a quarter while others were as tiny as a marble. I stared down at the eyes she'd collected from small animals and I wondered how she'd gotten them, and shuddered at the thought. 


""Man, I thought I had it bad with Becca's shoe addiction. But fuck me. Your wife's in here collecting eyeballs."" Chris said, gagging.  ""Ben, I think we should go.""  He called from the hall. ""I'm getting nauseous.""



""Alright."" I grabbed my duffle and shut the closet door on my new nightmare. I stepped out into the hall and took a deep breath of air. I could taste the rot on my tongue and I couldn't help but gag. 



""Who the fuck lines up eyeballs in their closet like that?""  Chris mumbled. 


""I tried to tell you she needed help."" I said. 



""She doesn't need help, Ben. She needs a fucking exorcist."" He said. ""You coming or what? I can't stand the smell any- "" his words died in his throat, and his eyes grew wide with fear. 



I didn't ask him why. I could feel it. Someone was watching me and I didn't think it was the eyes in the closet.  I turned around, my eyes slowly scanning the bedroom. 



""Christ"" I whispered, as I finally saw what we'd missed. Under the bed, curled on her side, watching us with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning, was my wife. 


She held her hands together just under her chin, and they were shaking eagerly.  



Now that she knew she'd been found, I could hear the quiet noises she was making. A sort of hiccuping sound in her throat, as if the excitement was just too much for her. It was unnerving to say the least. Wide eyes, and that same huge smile. 



Everything in me told me to run, but I forced it away. This was my wife. No matter how twisted, she was still the woman I married. I had to help her. 



""Lynn…""  I said softly. She didn't respond, but her head bobbed back and forth in two quick little movements as if she were nodding. 



""Baby. I just wanna help okay? Can you…. Can you let me do that?"" I asked. I had taken a single step forward, approaching her like some kind of dangerous animal. 



""I love you, Lynn."" I said softly, taking another step closer. She let a tiny moan escape her wide open mouth and I had to resist the urge to run.  Her shoulders were starting to quiver, and her eyes grew as large as saucers. 



I crouched down so I could see her better, and immediately saw the blood. Her hands were covered in it. They trembled more the closer I got, as if she was barely able to contain herself. 



""Lynn. Are you hurt? You're bleeding."" I said. She bobbed her head again, her bloody fingers moving up and down as if playing an invisible piano. They occasionally grazed her chin, leaving smears of blood on her skin. 



I wanted to recoil in disgust. The smell that was coming off of her was revolting. I could feel the vomit trying to climb up my throat. 
Her lips were dry and stretched thin, blood seeping between the cracks. 


I knew she wouldn't come out on her own, but I didn't want to leave her in the state she was in. 


I scooted closer and reached out to her. The excited hiccuping sounds got louder and her hands shook, fingers flexing. It was then that I could see the blood oozing from in between her fingers. 



""Oh my God, Lynn. You're bleeding."" I said. Instinctively I reached out to take her hand, but before I could even touch her, her hand sprang out towards me. A sharp pain shot through my arm, and I fell back on my ass. My arm burned, and I could see the blood dripping down onto the carpet. 


I looked back at her in shock and saw her grinning madly, her fingers clutching a large shard of glass. 



""You alright in there?"" Chris asked from behind me. 



I turned my head slightly, and nodded to him, cradling my arm to my chest. When I turned back to face Lynn, I saw that her focus had shifted. She wasn't looking at me anymore. And she wasn't smiling anymore either. 



She was staring past me, her eyes glaring at Chris the way a hungry lion might stare at an antelope. Her mouth was still hanging open but it was twisted into a snarl.


I got to my feet, and began walking backwards down the hall, afraid to take my eyes off her. 



""Are you... bleeding?"" Chris asked. The moment the words left his mouth Lynn started fast scooting out from under the bed, the glass shard still in her fist. 



""Chris. Run. Go!"" I yelled. He must have been too afraid to move because a second later I felt my back bump into him. He was still standing at the top of the stairs, staring at the horror that was my wife. 



Lynn had crawled completely out from under the bed and stood in the bedroom doorway, her face twisted in rage. Her whole body was visibly tense. Blood ran down her fingers and onto the floor. 



""Jesus, Lynn..."" Chris said, ""You uh… playing hide and seek?"" I reached back and pushed him towards the steps. 



""Move your ass Chris"" I said as quietly but firmly as I could. 



Lynn bobbed her head in fast, sharp motions, and began to grin, stretching her mouth open wider and wider so that her chin seemed to touch her chest. I heard Chris mutter a prayer and then he was running down the stairs. I stood at the top of the steps, stuck between the love for a woman who clearly needed serious help, and self preservation. 




""I only want to help."" I said, choking back tears. Her eyes focused on me once again as she slowly lifted the glass, holding it out in front of her. And then she started sprinting towards me, grinning with utter excitement. Thankfully my body took over and I flew down the stairs skipping two or three at a time. I made it to the front door before I felt her leap onto my back, wrapping her arms around my neck, her open mouth next to my ear so that I could hear those terrible hiccuping sounds up close. I shook her off me, knocking her to the floor. I felt a searing pain in my back as she went but I tore open the front door and bolted to my car. 



Chris was standing in the front yard, talking on the phone with the police. I didn't say a word, I just ran to my car and jumped in. Chris took the hint and followed me, still on the line with 911



I watched the rear view mirror, sure I'd see her there, running after us. But I never did. 



I went straight to the ER and got 11 stitches in my arm and 3 on my back. The police asked a lot of questions and went back to the house to do a search but of course, Lynn wasn't there. 


They advised me to stay with a friend or relative for a while and to file a restraining order as soon as I could but none of those things would matter. Somehow I just knew. 



I dropped Chris off at home, and went to a motel an hour away. I wanted to put as much distance between me and Lynn as I could. 



This is where I've been for the last 4 hours. I thought maybe the police would find her, maybe they'd get her the help she desperately needs. 


But now I don't think so. Because 40 minutes ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just three words :



""I found You."" 



And a picture attached. The picture was dark and grainy, but I instantly knew what it was. There was no mistaking my wife's eye. 



I started typing this out immediately after. I don't know what to do. I'm alone and scared, and I can't help but feel that I'm being watched….",Entertainment
nosleep,Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.,"Every night, no matter the weather, something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you’re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint, somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We’re towards the middle of the street, so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.

When I was younger, my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn’t like that and we’d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.

Don’t try to look at whatever was whistling.

My neighborhood is a funny place. I’ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept, good-sized yards, plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age, I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up, I’m old enough to see it. And there’s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.

The whistling never bothered me much. Like I said, I couldn’t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don’t like talking about it, so I’ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy, tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family, my grandparents, they’re from the islands. That’s what they call it. My dad, the only time he isn’t so calm is if the whistler comes up.

He talks a little quicker then, eyes move faster, and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule, the Big Rule: don’t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.

Not that we could look even if we wanted. See, there are shutters on the inside of every window, thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock, about the size of what you’d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.

My mom…I don’t know what she thinks about the whistling. I’ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She’s not out there often, at least I haven’t caught her much, but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.

The whistler has the same tune every night. It’s…cheerful.

*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*

Remember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well, besides our night whistler, everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It’s hard to explain and dad doesn’t like us talking about this part much, either, but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually, it’s small things, winning a radio contest, or getting an unexpected promotion at work, or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard, you know, the authentic kind.

The weather is pretty good and there’s no crime and everybody’s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. “A million little blessings,” I’ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here, why we moved here in the first place, is my sister Nola. She was born very sick, something with her lungs. We couldn’t even bring her home when she was born, only visit her in the hospital. She was so small, I remember, small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.

We moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here, Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn’t figure it out, they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew, even I knew, Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.

So that’s why we stayed even after we found out that, for every small miracle that happens here every day, now and then…some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.

See, our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They’re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk, gave me a Snickers bar, and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.

Then the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was, really exceptionally, hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group, our new neighbors, warned my parents that the whistling was quiet, would never harm or hurt us, as long as we didn’t look for what was making the sound.

This part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change, sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong, would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings, stories about car crashes and ruined lives, public deaths and freak accidents.

“Not everyone dies,” I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. “But the life goes out of ‘em. Even if they live, there’s no light in them ever again, no presence.”

My mom, I could tell she wasn’t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry, accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home, asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down, told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.

After the committee left, dad went out to the hardware store, bought the canvas blinds, the latches, and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house, I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch, holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.

At exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.

*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*

It came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she’s grown into a strong, clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don’t get new neighbors often, why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in, my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole, a gift basket, and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad’s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we’d be getting new neighbors again very soon.

Not long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner, Ms. Maddie, passed away at age 105. She’d lived a good, long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they’d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee, took my dad’s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope, whatever evidence, my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.

One night, when our new neighbors had to leave town, they sent their son, Holden, to stay with us. He was 12, a year under me in school. I didn’t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.

“Do you know who is always out there whistling every night?” Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.

The three of us were sitting in the den, some Disney movie playing idly on the television.

My sister and I exchanged a glance. “We don’t talk about that,” I said.

“I think it’s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner,” Holden said.

“Mr. Toles?” my sister asked. “No way, he’s really nice.”

Holden shrugged. “Must be a psycho killer, then.”

Nola tensed.

“We don’t talk about it,” I repeated. “Let’s go in my room and play Nintendo.”

We spent the next few hours playing games, eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.

After my parents had wished us a good night, locked the blinds, and gone to bed, Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.

“Have you ever even tried looking?” he asked. “It’s nearly time.”

Like most sleepovers, we’d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.

I sighed. “We don’t-”

“See, I can’t, I can’t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key,” he continued, ignoring me.

“So does our dad,” said Nola.

“No,” replied Holden. “No, he doesn’t.”

“You saw him do it,” I said, a little sharper than I meant to sound.

Holden grinned. “Your dad locks the blinds, yeah, but he doesn’t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.”

“So?” I asked, worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn’t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.

“So, after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed, I went to the bathroom. And on my way, I may have peeked into their room, and I may have seen your dad’s key chain on his nightstand, and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.”

Nola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.

“You’re lying,” I said.

Holden shrugged. “You can check if you want. Just open your parents’ door and look, you’ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.”

“Stay here,” I told both of them. “Don’t move a muscle.”

I hurried over to my parents’ room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn’t lying…my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door, barely an inch, and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath, I walked into the room.

Two steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly…from my parents’ room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don’t think I could have slept through it.

I stood there, listening to the whistling come closer, unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.

“Nola,” I yelled, running out of my parents’ room.

Holden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn’t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.

Holden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him, hunched up, afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.

I think I made a sound, called out. I can’t remember. Time felt frozen, clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I’m not fast, I’ve never been athletic. Somehow, though, I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise, and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.

But I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time, I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.

The whistling stopped.

I felt Nola shaking in my arms.

“Don’t look, okay?” I told her. “Don’t turn around.”

We were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.

I reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.

“Holden?” I asked.

Silence.

I reached past him and gingerly felt for the window, eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window, searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally, I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.

I opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen, I could make out Holden, pale and small, staring at the now closed window.

“Holden?” I asked again.

He turned towards me and he *screamed.*

Everything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall, then the living room. My parents’ footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn’t turn to look back at them, my eyes were glued to Holden.

He was pale, had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he’d wet himself.

“What happened?” my dad asked from behind me.

I managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. “He looked.”

I’d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night, in that moment, an old, ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent’s fear.

“Just Holden?” he mouthed to me.

I nodded yes.

My dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad’s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.

There was a knock at the door.

We all froze. Holden whimpered.

“Don’t answer it,” my mom said.

She stood at the threshold of the hall. I’d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.

The knock came again, a little louder this time.

“Please don’t open the door,” Holden whispered.

My dad walked over to him, hugged him close.

“We won’t,” my dad promised, still holding his bat. “Nothing is coming in here tonight.”

Thud thud thud

This time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us, wrapping my sister and me close.

**Thud thud thud**

“Call the police,” my mom whispered to my dad.

The knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.

“Do you think-”

He was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.

“*Police*,” something said from the other side of the door.

The voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom, like a parrot repeating the words back to her.

“*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.” **tap tap tap** “*Police*.”

My mom pulled us closer.

“*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.”

“Please stop,” I heard her whisper.

“I don’t think calling them will help,” my dad said. “How will we know when they’re the ones at the door?”

The knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment, I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.

We all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back, back to front, loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly, the sound was coming from both doors at once, big, heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house, then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.

“STOP!” Holden yelled.

The knocking died.

“I won’t tell,” Holden said, staring at the door. “I promise I won’t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.”

We waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it, a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.

Holden started to cry, sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.

My dad held him, brushed his hair but never lied to him, never told him things would be okay.

The tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don’t know how long. Eventually, my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back, so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn’t take it.

We went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.

The tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That’s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents’ bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.

“Okay,” he told us. “It’s done.”

Holden’s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day, right at my side, sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn’t tell us what they said to Holden’s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together, ordered pizza and watched movies.

That night everyone slept in my room, Nola and my mom in the bed with me, my dad in a chair he’d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.

We didn’t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor, grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.

I remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies, but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.

I think Holden’s parents must have looked, either to comfort him if they didn’t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days, happy and young and alive, and I wonder if I’d been slower, if she’d looked out the window that night…would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I’m glad I don’t have to find out.

We still live in that house, in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings, the luck, the good things here are too good to leave. But we’re careful. We don’t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very, very well. Not that I’ve gone looking. Some things you just don’t need to look for.

[Hello](https://travisbrownwriting.com)",Entertainment
nosleep,She Sold Happiness in Glass Jars,"The poster read, “Happiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!” and underneath the text was a phone number.

I was walking home from a long, exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.

I was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment, but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it—dinner, dishes, laundry, packing a snack for our daughter, putting her to bed, then putting her toys away that she’d left out in the living room—every night, it was the exact same routine.

The next day, I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job, so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.

At work, I was updating the company’s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly, so I decided to head out of the office early—it also helped that it was a Friday, and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.

On my walk back, I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Kelsey. I mean, I still do. We just don’t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship, whether it’s *meant to be* or not, some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage, and then you have a baby, then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool, then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah, blah, blah.

I’m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I’m just saying I wasn’t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn’t have referred to myself as a happy person.

As I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back, I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don’t know why, I really don’t, but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says, “I love you!” on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it’s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.

I called. It only rang once before someone picked up.

“Hello?” a woman said. 

“Uh, hi—um, I’m calling about your poster? Your ad?”

“Oh, awesome,” she said calmly, “when do you wanna pick it up?”

“Pick what up?”

“The jar…” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“Oh, of course, um,” I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey, so I could just go pick it up now and she’d be none the wiser, “what exactly is it? That your selling?”

“I just told you. It’s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They’re more durable than, say, a plastic bag.”

“Um, okay. Should we meet somewhere?”

“For sure. I don’t want you to end up being a creep or something, so let’s go to a public place.”

The public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.

Now, I didn’t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking, *Oh no, ‘happiness’ is probably a nickname for some street drug and I’m going to a drug deal. What if she’s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking, and so I did.

I stood outside and texted her.

Me: **I’m here.**

Her: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**

Me: **What are you driving?**

Her: **Silver Camry.**

And as her final text came through, I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car, which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement, looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand, gesturing for me to come over to her car, so I did.

She was young, maybe mid-twenties, with curly, golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch’s clothes.

“Nice day out,” she said as a greeting.

“Oh, yeah it is. Hadn’t really paid attention to it.”

“You *were* the one that called about the jar, right?”

“Yeah, that was me.”

“Cool, well, here you go.”

She handed me a very small, glass mason-jar. It couldn’t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb—just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun, or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.

“Pretty rad isn’t it?”

“What—what is it?”

“You’ve asked that, like, three different times, I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.”

“What do I do with it?”

“Keep it,” She said simply, “if you have any problems shoot me a text.”

She started to get into her car.

“Wait!” I said, “I thought you were selling this? How much is it?”

“Don’t worry, man,” she said with a smile, “you’ll pay.”

She closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up, then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again, its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.

What was just a nice, sunny day, quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain, or else I would’ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.

I walked up to my door and found that my key wasn’t on my key ring anymore. *Shit, I can’t believe I lost it again,* I thought.

I knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice, “Hey babe it’s me, I don’t know what happened to my key.” I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.

When the door opened, I was greeted by a large, heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee, he said, “I think you got the wrong door, bud.”

“Oh!” I said, disoriented, “my bad, sorry, have a good one.”

He let out a chuckle as he closed the door. 

Apartment number 33.

I know that was my apartment. I know it was. I’d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside, all the furniture was different, it was painted a different color, it was all wrong. I felt like I’d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment, nothing made sense.

I pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn’t in my phone. In fact, nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn’t looking? I would’ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually, but I couldn’t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before, but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office, I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.

Since it was still raining, I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office, the whole time staring at my wet shoes, wondering what the hell was going on.

We have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet, always. But, surprise, surprise—it wasn’t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments, or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. 

**BZZZ** 

“Hey this is Tim, I must’ve lost my card. My employee number is…” I stopped as I drew a blank.

A voice came through the Speaker, “Tim? You got cut out, what’s your employee number?""

“Um, I can’t remember, I—”

“That’s fine, just tell me your full name and department.”

“Uh, finance. I’m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.”

“One sec.”

About thirty seconds later, the man spoke to me again.

“We don’t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?”

I backed up in surprise, almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer’s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands, unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn’t in control, I was merely sitting inside somebody else’s head, watching the world through their eyes.

Just then, I got a text. I recognized the number immediately, it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.

Her: **Hey. How’s it going?**

I looked at my phone, dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.

Me: **What the hell did you do to me?!**

Her: **The worst is yet to come.**

I was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged, still glowing just as bright.

“What the fuck did you do!” I yelled at the jar, realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.

As I stared at its glistening glass, I realized something. I didn’t know what my wife’s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well, I know it started with a K, or maybe a C. I couldn’t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes, because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just, couldn’t remember their faces then—or their names, or their birthdays, or any memories I had with them.

I know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning, right? I couldn’t remember how she looked, or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding, right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter—or was it my son? Maybe I didn’t even have a kid. But my wife, or girlfriend, she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn’t see her in my head. I couldn’t recall a single fact about her.

I was standing outside of the same building, but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face, making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn’t remember my parents, or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?

I looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I’d ever been.

My phone buzzed:

**Break the jar, Tim.**

I looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky, I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn’t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head, and brought it down with one swift motion, shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.

That dark, chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off, and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm, yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created—like God had just snapped his fingers and said, “let there be light.” I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain, or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter’s night, but that warmth was covering every inch by body.

And then I blinked.

Immediately I could feel the sheets beneath me, and my back barely touching my wife’s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.

I stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:

**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**

I called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter’s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn’t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. 

I got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn’t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually—she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying, or monotonous, or dull.

But not today. Today, I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.

Today was going to be a good day. Today, I was happy.",Entertainment
nosleep,A Shattered Life,"I don't know when you're going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.

As it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding, but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.

The solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.

For a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.

It was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.

The first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.

Then, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn't understand how to fight back.

Mar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.

""Hey,"" I asked her with confusion. ""How'd you get a key?""

She just laughed. ""You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?"" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. ""I know living together is a big step, especially when we've only been dating three months.""

Living together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.

My things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.

The entity had eaten three months of my life.

What the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.

That fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone's job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.

One day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.

Surprised, I asked, ""Who are you? How did you get in here?""

He laughed and smiled brightly. ""Silly Daddy!""

My heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.

The agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.

It was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.

The church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.

The doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.

By the time I ran out of options, I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.

But the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.

She was happily surprised by the settings on the table. ""A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!""

Thank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.

Through carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it. 

And so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, ""Writer."" I told him that was a fine idea.

Then, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.

That was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life, and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.

But of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.

As the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.

A teenager touched my arm. ""Grandpa?""

""Eh?"" He'd startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. ""Who are you?""

He half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, ""It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?""

Ahh, of course. ""Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.""

He burned bright red. ""Trying to, anyway.""

""All right. Run off, I'll read this right now."" The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.

It seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.

Finally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. ""How was it?""

""Well, it's terrible,"" I told him truthfully. ""But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid."" I paused. ""I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.""

He nodded. ""It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.""

""You're far too young to be aware like that,"" I told him. An idea occurred to me. ""If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?""

""Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.""

Warily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.

For a teenager, he took it well. ""You're serious?""

""Yes.""

He donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. ""I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.""

Wow. ""Sounds like a plan."" I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. ""But how will I get all the notes in one place?""

""Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them,"" he said, frowning with thought. ""Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern.""

For the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. ""How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.""

""Sure."" He turned and left the living room.

I peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.

Finally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, ""Holy crap!""—but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say *crap*.

Taken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. ""Did I write those?""

He looked up at me with wonder. ""Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this."" He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. ""So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.""

That much I understood. ""Right.""

He gulped. ""There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time."" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. ""But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can."" 

Tears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. ""Thank you. Thank you so much.""

And then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.

I put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.

I'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. ""Come on, I think I finally figured it out.""

I was so frail that moving was painful. ""Are you him? Are you my grandson?""

""Yes."" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. ""The pattern finally revealed itself.""

""How long have you worked on this?"" I asked him, aghast. ""Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!""

His expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. ""It'll be worth it."" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. ""Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.""

The electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.

It was a parasite.

And it was feeding on my mind.

My now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, ""Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?""

Fearful, I asked, ""Is Mar here?""

His face softened. ""No. Not for a few years now.""

I could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn't want it to be true. ""How?""

""We have this conversation a lot,"" he responded. ""Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.""

Tears brimmed in my eyes. ""Then I don't care if it hurts, or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.""

He made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. ""I've worked for two decades to figure this out, and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.""

I didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. ""What's µ¬ßµ?""

He paused his work and grew pale. ""I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky, believe me."" After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. ""Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it's basically electro-shock therapy.""

I could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead, I'd just been with her moments ago. ""Do it.""

The click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything—at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. 

As my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.

The electricity made my memories flare.

Mar's smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.

I'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.

No. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts, but I hadn't wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.

It wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.

The fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.

My scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.

Oh God.

I turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before—but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.

I returned home in a daze.

And while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.

But all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.

But now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.

On a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, ""Hey, who's this?""

Even though I already knew.

Author's note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He's still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn't recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.

nosleep,My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.,"Three years ago I was looking at the local job classifieds online when one of the ads caught my eye, not because of what it said, but because it said so little.  Best I remember, the ad just read “Job available.  Good pay.  No benefits.  Discretion required.”  It then listed an email address and that was all.  At the time I was managing a music store, but I had already started hearing rumors we would be shutting down within the next year and the likelihood of a transfer to another store was slim. I had been morosely looking at job listings for the last few days, but this was the first one that stood out, if only because I was bored and it was weird.

So I sent an email.

Half an hour later I had a response, telling me to go to a particular office building in an upscale part of the city at a precise time for my “screening”.  I went, and after waiting for a few minutes in the lobby, I was taken into an office where I was given a series of forms and questionnaires to fill out.  They collected them and told me they would be in touch.

I had almost forgotten about the whole thing until a month later I got a call saying I had moved on to the second stage of the hiring process.  I was again given an address and time, and when I arrived (this time it was a different nice office park twenty miles away from the first one), I was met by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Solomon.  He escorted me into a large room that contained a chair and a desk.  On the desk were two large monitors, a keyboard and mouse, and a bolted down metal box with two oversized buttons on it:  One red and one green.

He told me this room was a model for the place I would be working if I took the job.  He described the job as follows.

I would be working seven shifts of six hours every week.  My job would be simple.  I would arrive at work ten minutes early and enter an outer area that was like a locker room.  I would have my own personal locker.  I would store all belongings in the locker and change into the provided work clothes.  I was never, under any circumstances, to carry any item of my own into the surveillance room.  I was never, under any circumstances, to take any item with me from the surveillance room.

As for what I was to do in the surveillance room, I was told that the monitor on the left would constantly show a live stream from a high-definition camera in a remote location.  My job was simply to watch the camera.  Once an hour I would get onto the computer attached to the right monitor and enter a brief log describing anything interesting that occurred in the last hour.  I would have no pens or pencils or paper, and I should never try to take any kind of written notes about the work.

As for the red and green buttons, the red button was only to be used if there was an emergency.  This meant something on the video or in my workspace that required outside help.  The green button was to be hit if I saw something on the video feed that was particularly noteworthy.  It would tell other people somewhere that, at least in my opinion, something interesting was going on.  Solomon stressed that while I was given discretion on when to use this button, I should err on the side of only using it if and when something “of real significance” occurred.

He pointed out the camera on the ceiling of the room we were in.  He said the real room would be the same.  My work would be observed, and other people were watching the room on the video feed as well.  He said I was only a redundancy in case other systems failed.  He then smirked and asked if I knew what he meant by redundancy.

I nodded, trying not to show my irritation.  I don’t talk that good to people, so sometimes they think I’m dumb.  That’s okay.  Let him think that if he paid me good enough.

The pay was very good.  Thirty-five dollars an hour.  

This worried me.  I was already thinking this was some kind of psych experiment or secret government job, which I was okay with.  But that kind of money to sit and watch a screen?  My mom always told me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and this was seeming too good to be true.

I asked if I was going to be doing anything illegal.  Solomon laughed and said no.  I asked if anyone was going to get hurt.  Again, he shook his head no.  He said the reason they were paying so much was because they needed employees that were motivated to be professional and discrete.  The work they were doing was important, and for various reasons it couldn’t be discussed.  If I took the job, I would have to sign papers promising I would never discuss my work there or I could be sued or locked up.  I’m only breaking that now because of everything that’s happened.

So I took the job, and because they wanted me to start right away, I had to quit the store with no notice.  I felt bad about that, but I was excited about the new job too.  It was a lot of money and seemed like easy enough work, if a bit boring.  I was nervous that there was something more to it, but I told myself I would just have to see.  No point in chickening out and wasting a good chance because I let my imagination go crazy.
I was given the location of the job itself, and when I went there, I was amazed that it really was just like the model room I had been shown with only a few differences.  There was a locker room you had to pass through to enter the surveillance room and there was a small bathroom attached to the real surveillance room also.  The real room had a small water cooler in the corner, but because I wasn’t allowed to bring anything in with me, I had to eat before or after every shift.  The biggest difference, of course, was that the monitors were turned on.

The right monitor was just a black and white terminal like you see in movies some times.  I could type in my logs, but no internet to look at or anything like that.  The left monitor…

It was video from a room.  You would call it a bedroom I guess, because it had a bed in it, but it had lots of other stuff too.  A T.V., a sofa and chairs, a couple of tables, and plenty of empty space in between.  The camera must be high up in a corner, because I could see pretty much everything except for the far sides of furniture.  At first though, I didn’t notice any of that stuff.  

All I saw was her.

She looked to be a little older than me and was very pretty.  When I first saw her, she was laying on her side on the sofa.  That was the part of the room farthest from the camera, but the picture was very clear and I could tell that she was sleeping.  I found myself leaning into the monitor more so I could see her better, and then I thought about what I was doing and felt embarrassed.  It’s like I was spying on her.  A Peeping Tom, my mom used to call it.

I didn’t want to be a Peeping Tom, but I didn’t want to be silly either.  I needed to think about it slow.  

It was a good job.  And I wasn’t doing anything wrong, right?  I wasn’t hurting anybody.  The woman looked fine.  And the room was nice.  She probably agreed to be there and it’s all some experiment or something.  I was just overreacting.

So I sat down in the chair and began my work.

**** 

It didn’t take long before I understood more.  The woman, I took to calling her Rachel, wasn’t there of her free will.  I never saw her hurt, but it was clear that she never left that room except to go into what I think is a bathroom area that my camera couldn’t see.  Well, she never left the room on her own.  Periodically, usually a couple of times a week during my shifts, men and women in strange-looking outfits would come in and take her from the room.  Sometimes she would struggle, but usually she would just go along with her head hung low.

They would always bring her back, though the times when she wasn’t brought back during my shift were always the worst for me.  I would worry about her until I got to work the next day and saw her in the room watching T.V. or painting.  She never looked hurt or even that upset except for when they took her, and even when she fought, they were always gentle with her.  

Still, I knew something was wrong.  I considered quitting the job, or hitting the red button and getting someone to come so I could get some answers.  Or calling the police and showing them what the camera was showing me.

Except I was scared.  Scared of losing my job,  and scared of what these people might do to me if I quit or told on them.  Solomon had told me when I took the job that part of being discreet was not asking questions.  I would never be asked to do more than I had already been told, but I could never tell anyone what I did or saw, and I could never ask questions about what I was doing or why.

So I made excuses.  It was all an experiment.  She was crazy or sick and they were trying to help her.  She was doing a job just like I was.  Or if she really was a prisoner somewhere, at least I was watching to make sure that she was okay.  If they ever tried to hurt her, or I saw that she really didn’t want to be there for sure, I could get help then.  In a way, I told myself, I was helping to protect her by watching.

I don’t expect you to think much of my excuses.  I don’t think much of them myself, especially now.  But in my defense, when things changed, I didn’t ignore it or try to explain it away.  I knew something had to be done.

****

Rachel would usually paint for an hour or two every day, and it seemed to always be during my afternoon shifts.  The room had no windows as far as I could tell, but I guess she either used a clock or her own body’s time to keep to a kind of schedule.  I always liked to watch her paint—the thing she was painting was always facing the wrong way for me to see it, but I could see her face as she worked.  She always looked peaceful and happy when she was painting, and seeing her that way, smiling serenely from time to time as she got something the way she wanted it, always made my day.

I first noticed something was wrong when she started painting more frequently a few weeks ago.  Her expression was more focused and serious, and there was a tension to her movements that I wasn’t used to seeing.  At first I thought she was just really trying to work hard on something, and I wanted to tell her not to worry.  Every few weeks the others would come in and take the old paintings out anyway, bringing in a new stack of…I think the word is canvas.

But it was more than her being focused.  Something was wrong.  She didn’t look happy and she was going for hours at a time.  In the span of three days, she had finished four paintings.

I had been growing more and more worried watching her work, and when she finished the fourth, I found myself telling her to just stop and rest awhile.  I had grown accustomed to talking to the monitor, talking to *her* in my own way.  But she didn’t stop.  Instead she began moving the paintings.  Arranging them on the back and seat of the long sofa at the far end of the room.  

This was the first time I had gotten to see any of the paintings.  Even when the others were taking them out, they always seemed to be turned away from the camera.  I was still worried about her, but I was also happy to finally see something she had worked on.  Happy and amazed.

They were beautiful.  One was a beautiful green forest.  Another was an old stone well.  A third was a house sitting alone on a small island.  The last was an old-fashioned looking movie theater.  All of them looked like something out of a dream, with trailing lines of color mixing in the air around them like leaves caught in a wind.  It was only when I looked close that I realized the lines of color weren’t random.  They were words.  Easy to miss if you weren’t looking close, and by themselves, they didn’t seem to mean much.  Just the ghost of a word somewhere in each of the paintings, easy to lose in everything else that was being shown.

I leaned into the monitor and squinted, trying to read the words.  Then my heart started thudding as I made them out.  Blinking and rubbing my eyes, I looked again, reading them out loud in order—left to right, top pair then bottom.

“Please.”

“Help.”

“Me.”

“Thomas.”

I pushed back from the monitor, my hand over my mouth.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t know how any of this could be happening.  It wasn’t just that she was asking for help, though that was a big part of it.

nosleep,The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide. I’m not sure I want to live here anymore.,"
I moved in with my boyfriend yesterday. We’ve been together for 5 years now and we’re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I’m 22. He’s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn’t be happier to be living with him. 

When we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses, we couldn’t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.

Jamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I’m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don’t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. 

We had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special, but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park, a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area, but neither of us had been wealthy growing up, we weren’t fussy. Just grateful to be together. 

The advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections, but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I’d never heard of anything quite like it.

We knew that for our budget and location we weren’t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast, not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. 

Move in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together, it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos, getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42, on the 7th floor. The items we couldn’t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren’t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. 

In the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa, given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. 

We slept soundly last night, I felt safe and happy. I don’t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it’s all due to the note I found this morning. 

I found it in the kitchen, having a coffee, hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall, there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat, a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up), spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. 

The note was handwritten with “New occupier of flat 42” in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can’t really describe it to you, so I’m going to copy it out below. 

*Dear New Occupier,*

*Firstly, welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I’d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can’t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first, but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it’s filled with sadness.*

*Anyway. When you’ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it’s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*

*It’s a wonderful home, honestly, I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*

*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn’t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let’s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*

*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don’t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don’t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn’t do this. Just please don’t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*

*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don’t question it, Mr Prentice lives there and he’s a lovely chap. Don’t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he’s old school, so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do, don’t check on him when you hear the noises. You’ll know when you hear them.*

*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you’ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don’t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you’ll need some resilience. Whatever you do, don’t offer him anything. No money, no hot drink.*

*5. Don’t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals, it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand, the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don’t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*

*6. Don’t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor, all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They’ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*

*7. Simple one for you here, keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*

*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It’s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It’s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn’t recommend babysitting Terri’s 2 children. She’ll ask you, because the poor woman needs a break, but if you accept don’t say I didn’t warn you.*

*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they’re supposedly a special, expensive breed, but they don’t belong to anyone. They’re mostly  harmless, but don’t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It’ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn’t want to see them hurt.*

*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning, but please try not to be alarmed, it doesn’t drip, it doesn’t get any bigger and it’s been there longer than I have. The landlord won’t budge on it, according the the agents. I flagged it many times, even called the police the first night it changed colour, but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It’s best to ignore it.*

*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he’s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can’t include everything here, or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*

*12. Finally, the first few weeks are the worst. You’ll feel like you’ve made a mistake, I’m sure reading this you already do, but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special, but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best, I really do.*

*Yours truly*, 

*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*

I don’t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can’t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they’d never met. 

There were also parts of the note I couldn’t disprove, there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.

Our dream, our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check, sure enough, two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. 

At about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn’t want to take the risk until I’d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I’d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes, but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. 

My windows were sparkling, and due to our lack of curtains I couldn’t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. 

When he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat, but I couldn’t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. 

Jamie still hadn’t text me back, he must have been having a rough shift, it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn’t often that he didn’t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.

I read the note probably hundreds of times over, I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. 

I hoped for that so much.

But Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn’t home. I panicked, I cried, I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn’t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. 

I thought about it, what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie’s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn’t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It’s getting late and he still isn’t home, what if it’s all true?

nosleep,"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell","I wasn't sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I'd share them here. I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. 

* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. 
The first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. 
The other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.

* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.

* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.

* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. 

* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.

* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.
On just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. 

I have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know.

nosleep,Spacegirl,"We called her Spacegirl.   


Her real name was Megan Daniels, but nobody actually called her that. She’d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I’d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn’t like to be around us. She didn’t play with us when we were kids, she didn’t even talk much.  


Most of the time, she’d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she’d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn’t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.   


It all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.

It had been raining that day, so we’d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.

  “I can’t believe they let that retard sit in with us.” Sasha murmured, “Look at her… Why do they even let them in schools? They aren’t gonna learn anything.”  
   “Better than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.” Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren’t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. “My Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.” None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  


Spacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she’d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   


  “What? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?” She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn’t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she’d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. 

  “What are you even doing in there, retard?” 

She’d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. 

  “What even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?” 

She handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. 

  “Wow. You can’t even draw. Look at this?”

She tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she’d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.

  “Draw something that isn’t trash next time.” Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. 

Spacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn’t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.

&#x200B;

After that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they’d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.

During the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.

  “Wow, that’s really good, Spacegirl.” Was how most of her comments would start, “Did you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?”

There was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.

  “Can you draw me?” Sasha asked once, “I heard that retards were always like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it’ll even look like a person!”

Spacegirl didn’t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won’t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren’t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.

&#x200B;

It was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don’t know all the details, and I don’t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I’d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  


James had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn’t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James’ parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  


We were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I’d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.  


  “LOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!” One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn’t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.

 “You fucking faggot assholes!” James yelled as he picked himself up.

  “Hey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!” aughed Brian, “Come on, give her a kiss!” 

Someone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn’t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn’t see Spacegirl until January… we didn’t see James or his friends ever again. 

&#x200B;

On Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn’t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he’d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual… I’d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  


I went over to Sasha’s house on the day before New Years. We’d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren’t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.

  “Hey! Kept me waiting!” She said when I knocked on the door.   
   “Sorry.”   
   “It’s fine. I’ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!”

I didn’t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she’d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.

  “You’re gonna love it.” She promised me, “It’s gonna be so funny…”

She led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  
   “Where did you get this?” I asked, walking closer to it.

  “Spacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day, she dropped it. I may have grabbed it… Y’know. Just for safekeeping.”  


She cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.  


  “Look at this… She’s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn’t even finish this one!”

She paused at one small picture that was labeled ‘The Unicorn Prince’. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.

  
  “I figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I’d step up! What do you think?” Sasha wasn’t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.

  
In her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed.   
In the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   
In the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building. 

Sasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.

  “What do you think?” She asked with a grin, “I’ll bet she’ll lose her shit!”

I closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.

  “A-are you out of your mind?” I asked. Sasha’s grin faded.

  “What do you mean?”

  “You stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that’s really messed up!”  
   “It’s Spacegirl, who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?”

  “You just… drew her killing herself over and over again!” I took the book off her desk, “Do you not understand what’s wrong with that?”

Sasha just stared at me like I was crazy.

  “Fine. Sue me for trying to be funny.” Sasha said, “Just give it here…” She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her. 

  “No. You’re just going to put something else in there.”

Anger flared in Sasha’s eyes.

  “Jane, just give me the book.”

  “No!”  


I opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but  pushed her back. I didn’t mean to push so hard, but I did and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide eyed and shocked. I don’t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes… Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn’t let it go until I got home.

&#x200B;

I spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha’s. I’d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I’d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she’d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she’d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn’t so sure.   


I remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she’d done. I remembered the ones I’d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through Unicorns, Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha’s place, it had been blank, but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  


I brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha’s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. 

&#x200B;

On the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they’d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn’t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   


I wasn’t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her sideying me. She didn’t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.

  “Hey.” I said, “I’m… I hope you had a nice Holiday.”

She didn’t respond.

  “I’m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn’t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean spirited.”

Still no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, then back at me.

  “Sasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn’t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there…” I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn’t seem angry or thankful. She didn’t seem anything at all. Just stoic.

  “I’m sorry if I wasn’t all that great to you before.” I said, and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. 

It wasn’t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I’d done.

&#x200B;

When Sasha got in, she didn’t talk to me. She didn’t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I’d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.

The Teacher hadn’t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  


  “What do you want?” She spat. 

Now it was my turn to be silent.  


  “Fuck off and leave us alone.” Tanya said, “You’d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don’t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It’s a quarantine issue.”   


I stared at both of them, and I could’ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt… What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn’t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she’d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.

&#x200B;

I didn’t really have anyone left… So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn’t happy with? I’d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she’d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.   


**Your Words**

*There is a land where your sorry may go.*

*A sickening land where it always snows*

*The snow is putrid in color and smell*

*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*

*Only your Father has been there before.*

*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*

*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*

*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*

*My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*

*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  


This was unlike anything I’d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful… This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she’d thrown it out. It didn’t fit with everything else she’d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly… This was something she’d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn’t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I’d made her feel. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighth grade wasn’t fun for me. 

I had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I’d punched her and stolen the book. Then I’d tried to kiss her, punched her when she’d refused, then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day, I’d done the right thing.

&#x200B;

By the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   


Sasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn’t pay her any mind.   
Spacegirl barely changed at all. I didn’t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she’d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship… but it never felt right.   


Sasha’s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she’d pull the same old shit she’d been pulling since the fifth grade. She’d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it… but I didn’t always see it.

  “Coming to her rescue again, huh Jane?” Sasha asked once when I’d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open. 

  “What’s she ever done to you anyways?” I asked, “She’s just minding her own business.”

  “Oh? What’s she done to you, dyke?” Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.

  “Unicorns… Unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns… When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?”  
   “Hey! I told you to stop.” I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  


  “Fine.” She said, “Tan, let’s leave the happy couple to their alone time.”  
She pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. 

Spacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.

I turned to leave her when I heard:

  “Thanks.”

I looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.

  “Um… You’re welcome.” I said, “Let me know if she bothers you again, alright?”

  “I will. But… you’re usually there anyways.” 

Her voice was soft and low. I’d heard it before, but I don’t remember her ever speaking directly to me.

  “Yeah, well. It’s just not right. She’s such a child. One of these days she’s going to have to grow up.”

Spacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again. 

For a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but… No. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. 

&#x200B;

In tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn’t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I’d ever seen.  


I went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I’d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn’t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.  


The Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the coke bottle glasses.

  “You must be Jane.” She said. She wasn’t smiling, but she didn’t sound upset either.

  “Yes ma’am…”

  “Come on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.”

The house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn’t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  


Sure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she’d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn’t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing… But then I noticed her walls.  


They weren’t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.

  “Holy shit, are these yours?”

  “They are.” Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.

  “It… it’s soothing.” She said after a while, “Painting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and… I finish them.”

She spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.  


  “We should get started.” She said, “Sorry…”

  “No, it’s alright!” I said. I sat in the chair for her. “I’d like to hear about it.”

Spacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw… Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she’d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she’d always liked fantasy, and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could’ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   


The portrait she’d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful… but this made me look transcendent. I wasn’t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.

  “I love it.” I told her, “That’s incredible Spa… Megan… That’s really great!”

  “You can call me Spacegirl if you want.” She said, “I don’t mind the nickname… Not as much as I mind the people at least.”

My awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn’t look upset… She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No… not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there. 

  “I wish… I wish I’d been nicer to you, when we were younger.” I said.

  “Is that why you’re here right now?” Spacegirl asked.

  “No! I… I’m here for the assignment. I mean… the art assignment. The portraits…” 

She continued to stare. 

  “Did you pick me because you felt bad for me?” She asked. 

  “No! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.”

Spacegirl didn't react for a moment, but then she just nodded. 

  “Okay.” Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. 

  “Mom can drive you home if you need a ride.” She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn’t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?

  “Alright. Thanks.” It was the only thing I could think of. “See you tomorrow.”

With that, I left her.

&#x200B;

I was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art… and when I did, I wasn’t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late… but what she’d brought in stole my breath away.  


It was my portrait, but she’d done more with it than I thought possible. She’d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.

&#x200B;

My portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I’d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.

  “Where’s your flower crown, dyke.” Sasha said, 

  “Leave me alone.” I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.

  “I always knew you were a little dyke. But now you’ve posted solid proof of it! We’ve gone and cracked the case, haven’t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!”

I tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.

  “What’s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?” She snapped at me.

  “Maybe she only fucks retarded girls.” Tanya said, “I’ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.”

I stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don’t know what it was about what she’d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I’m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn’t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.   


Naturally I got a three day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they’d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I’d seen last time I’d laid a hand on her… and something about it scared me.  


When I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they’d taken it down because I’d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.

  “Someone took it.” Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.

  “When?”  
   “The day after you hit Sasha… I don’t think anyone’s found it yet.”

She didn’t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn’t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn’t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn’t put it past her. In the end, it didn't matter.  


By the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.

The words:

***Retard Fucking Dyke***

Had been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn’t know what to say or do… But this felt like too much.  


The picture was taken down quickly… but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn’t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I’d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she’d been crying.

  “I’m sorry about the painting…” I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.

  “I knew she’d do something like that…” She said, “I’m so used to it by now, that it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.”

  “But you worked hard on that.” I said, “I’d be upset too.”

She just shook her head.

  “That’s not it.” She said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. 

Slowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.

It wasn’t the same drawing… but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read ‘*Retard Dyke Wedding’.*

  “There were so many in my locker…” Spacegirl said.

  “This is what she drew in your notebook… when I returned it to you… This is what I had to take out.”

Spacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn’t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I’d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though… When I looked back at her notebook, the Unicorn wasn’t there anymore. She must have just erased it… but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn’t been erased at all. 

&#x200B;

Tanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn’t know what she had in mind, but I didn’t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.

  “What do you want?” I asked.

  “It’s a surprise.” She said, “Sasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town… Oops, I’ve said too much.”

I wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind… it wasn’t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I’d do.

  “Come on, Dyke. Go home.” She said. “Let’s go check out your surprise.”

In a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn’t outrun her… I couldn’t fight her off. I didn’t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn’t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.

Tanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.

  “Hey Jane.” She said, “How’s it going?”

  “What the fuck is this?!”

  “Just wanted to chat.” Sasha said with a cold chuckle, “You think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You’ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you’re fucking choosing, right? Right? God… I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you’re better than me just because you feel bad for her.”

  “You’re crazy.” 

Sasha just laughed.

  “I’m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You’re absolutely fucking psycho!”

On the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.

  “You wanna be a Dyke, I don’t care. But I’m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!”

Sasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   
   “What the hell?” Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it… that was another story entirely.  


Standing on the path behind us was a Unicorn… but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but… that was impossible… It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!

Tanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn’t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya’s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   


Tanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  


Sasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya’s body. She didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  


Sasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha’s leg tightly.

Still with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting, and she took Sasha’s leg with her.

  “FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!”

Sasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn’t overpower it. She couldn’t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.

  “JANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!""

The hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  


Slowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. 

&#x200B;

They chalked Tanya’s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don’t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.

&#x200B;

High School was ten years ago though, and I’ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I’ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don’t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn’t like to talk about it and I won’t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different… but I don’t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn’t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge, there’s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl.",Entertainment
nosleep,Something happened 63 years ago that's haunted me my entire life. I’ve never told anyone about it—until now.,"It’s official: I’m an old man.

For the last couple years, I’ve comforted myself by saying I’m in my “early 70s,” but math is simple and unforgiving. Today is my 75th birthday, and God, the years do fly.

I’m not here for your well wishes; this is hardly a milestone I’m excited about. I’m glad to still be here, of course, but I find I have less and less to live for with every passing year. My bones ache, my kids live far away, and the other side of my bed has been empty for just over eight months now. In fact, once I cast my vote against that goddamned Trump this November, I may have nothing to live for at all.

So spare me your “happy birthdays” and your congratulations, if you please. I’m here because I have a story for you, and it’s one I’ve never told before. I used to think I kept it inside because it was silly, or maybe because nobody would believe it. I’ve found, though, that the older you grow, the more exhausting it becomes to lie to yourself. If I’m being perfectly honest, I’ve never told anybody this story because it scares me, almost to death. 

But death seems friendlier than it used to, so listen close.

*****

The year was 1950; the setting a small town in Maine. I was a boy of nine, rather small for my age, with only one friend in the world to speak of—and his family, seemingly on a whim, decided to move 2,000 miles away. It was shaping up to be the worst summer of my life.

My pop wasn’t around and my mom was a chore-whore—boy, was I proud of myself when I came up with that one—so I wasn’t apt to hang around the house. With some hesitation, I decided the public library was the place to be that summer. The library’s collection of books, particularly children’s books, was meager to say the least. But within the walls of that miserly structure, I would find no undone chores, no nagging mother (God rest her soul), and perhaps most importantly, no other children with whom I would be expected to associate. I was the only kid with a low enough social status to spend his precious days of freedom sulking amid the bookshelves, and that was just fine with me.

The first half of my summer was even more dreadful than I had imagined it would be. I would sleep in until 10, do my chores, and then ride my bike to the library (and by bike, I mean rusty log of shit attached to a pair of wheels). Once there, I would split my time between unintentionally annoying the elderly patrons and deliberately doing so. One pleasant lady actually interrupted my incessant tongue-clicking to hiss a “shut the fuck up!” at me—the first time I ever heard a grownup use The F Word. Big fuckin’ deal, I know, but in those days it was unheard of.

The dreary days turned to woeful weeks. I had actually begun praying for school to start again—until I discovered the basement. I could have sworn I’d roamed every inch of that library, but one day, in the far corner behind the foreign language collection I stumbled across a small wooden door I had never seen before. That was where it all began.

The door was windowless and made from oak that looked far older than the wall in which it rested. It had a knob of black metal that quite literally looked ancient—I wouldn’t have been surprised to learn it was crafted in the 17th century. Engraved on the knob was what appeared to be a single footprint. I had the sense that whatever lay beyond this door was forbidden to me, and therefore probably the most interesting thing I would encounter all summer. I quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was watching me, then turned the heavy knob, slipped behind the door, and shut it.

There was nothing; only darkness. I took a couple of steps and then stopped, unnerved by the totality of the shadow which surrounded me. I waved my hands in front of me in an attempt to find a wall or a shelf or anything to hold on to. What I actually found was far more subtle—a small string, dangling from above—but far more useful. I grabbed it firmly and pulled it down.

Back in the day, lots of lightbulbs were operated with strings, and this was one of them. My surroundings were instantly illuminated. I was standing on a small, dusty platform that looked as though it hadn’t seen life in quite some time. To my left was a crickety-ass spiral staircase, made of wood and appearing ready to collapse at any second. The bulb was the only source of light in the room, and it was feeble, so when I peered over the railing to see what lay below, the bottom of the staircase dissolved into the darkness.

I was beginning to feel scared. This place—wherever I was—seemed to have no business in a town library. It was as though I were in a completely different building. But no nine-year-old likes to let a mystery go unsolved. Looking back, I wish I could tell my prepubescent self to turn around, go back, do anything else besides descending that staircase. “You’ll be spared a lot of sleepless nights,” I’d say. But, of course, I didn’t know that then—and I may not have listened even if I had. So instead of turning back, I took a deep breath, gripped the railing, and glared resolutely forward as I began my descent.

The wood on the railing was dry and covered with splinters. I immediately let go, holding my hands out for balance as I carefully traversed the staircase. It was (or at least seemed) very long, and with only the dim glow from the string-bulb far above me, my heart pounded mercilessly in the darkness. Even kids can sense when something isn’t right, I think—they just don’t always give a shit.

By the time my feet reached the cement floor at the bottom, the light from the bulb above was very nearly a memory. But there was a new light source, and God, I’ll never forget it. Directly in front of me was a door, massive, and a deep shade of red. The light was coming from behind the door, and it shone out in thin lines from all four sides—a sinister, dimly glowing rectangle. For the second time, I took a deep breath and went through a door I shouldn’t have.

In contrast to the dank room I entered from, the room behind the door was blinding. When my eyes adjusted, what I saw nearly took my breath away. 

It was a library. The most perfect library imaginable.

I gaped in wonder as I stepped, almost reverently, further into the room. It was beautiful. It was smaller than the library above, much smaller, but it seemed to be almost tailor-made for me. The shelves were packed with brightly colored titles, both armchairs in the middle of the room were exquisitely comfortable, and the smell—my God, the smell—was simply unbelievable. Sort of a mixture of citrus and pine. I simply can’t do it justice with words, so I’ll suffice it to say that I’ve never smelled anything better. Not in my 75 years.

What was this room? Why had I never heard of it before? Why was nobody else here? Those were the questions I should have been asking. But I was intoxicated. As I gazed around at all the books and basked in the smell of paradise, I could only form one thought: *I will never be bored again.* 

*****

In truth, boredom only hid from me for three years. It was on my 12th birthday, 63 years ago to this day, that everything changed.

Before that day, I visited my basement sanctuary as often as I could—usually several times a week. I never saw another soul down there, yet strangely remained free of suspicion. I never removed a book from that room, but instead would pick up a particular volume wherever I had stopped reading during my previous visit. I sat, always in the same deep purple armchair, and always leaving its twin barren and directly across from myself. That armchair was mine, the other was—well, I suppose I couldn’t have articulated it then much better than I can now. But it wasn’t mine, that’s for damn sure.

On my twelfth birthday, I arrived later than usual. My mom had invited a couple classmates and some cousins over to our house to celebrate, a gesture which I found more tedious than touching—really, I just wanted to spend my birthday sitting and reading and smelling paradise. Eventually, our guests went home, and I made it to the library about fifteen minutes before closing time. That didn’t matter; the workers never checked down there before they locked up. I was free to stay as late as I wished. This particular night, I was devouring the final chapters of an epic adventure; knights, swords, dragons, and the like. I didn’t smell it until I read the final words and closed the book.

The once exquisite aroma of that room had turned sour. I sat for a moment, unsettled. Objectively, I could recognize that the smell was actually the same as it had been before—that mixture of citrus and pine. I just perceived it differently, and I didn’t like it anymore. It was the nasal version of an optical illusion; you know, the one that looks like a young woman glancing backward, but all of a sudden you see that it’s really an old woman facing toward you? You can’t unsee that, and I couldn’t unsmell this. The spell was broken.

The odor also seemed, for the first time, to be coming from somewhere specific. With a fair amount of trepidation, I stalked around the room, sniffing the air like a crazed canine until I came to a shelf near the back. The shelf was perfectly normal, with the exception of one title—a large, leatherbound cover of solid faded maroon, with one striking black footprint at the top of the spine. This was the source of the smell. I opened the front cover, and saw one sentence scrawled neatly in blood-red ink atop the first page: 

*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*

I stared at this sentence, mesmerized, as I began to retreat to my chair. I turned a page. Blank. The smell became stronger. Another page, blank, and the smell grew stronger still. I stopped for a moment, suppressed a gag, and continued walking. Then, as I neared the armchairs, I turned one final page—and there, in the same sinister print, was the last thing I expected to see: my own name. I dropped the book. I began to sprint toward the door, but as I shifted my gaze forward, my heart leapt to my throat and I stopped in my tracks.

The empty chair wasn’t empty anymore.

An aged man in a suit sat before me, one leg crossed over the other, contemplating me with piercing gray eyes and a light smirk. This was all too much. I fell to my knees and expelled the contents of my stomach onto the carpet. I wiped my mouth, staring at my vomit, when I heard the man let out a chuckle.

I stared at him disbelievingly. “Who are you?” I asked, panic in my voice.

The man leapt to his feet, grabbed me gently by the shoulders, and helped me to my chair. He sat, once again, in his own. “I fear we got off to a bad start,” he said, glancing at the pile of sick on the carpet. “The smell . . . it does take some getting used to.”

“Who are you?” I repeated.

“Tonight, you will know hardship like you’ve never before known,” he said. “I come as a friend, offering you refuge from it, and from all other storms which lie ahead.”

I wanted nothing more than to leave at that moment, but I remained seated. I asked him what he was talking about.

“Your mother is dead, my boy. By her own hand, in her kitchen. The scene is gruesome, I must admit,” he said in sorrowful tones, but was there a playful glint in his eye? “Surely you wish to avoid this path. I can show you a safer one.”

My blood ran cold at the horrors this man spoke of, but I did not believe him. “What do you want with me?” I demanded, trying to sound braver than I felt. He laughed, an old, raspy yelp that seemed to shake him to his bones.

“Nothing but your friendship, dear boy,” he said. Then, sensing I found his answer inadequate, he expounded. “I want you to come on a journey with me. My work is noble and you will make a fine apprentice. And maybe, when I’m done”—he sighed tiredly, running his bony fingers through his thin white hair—“maybe then, my work can be yours.”

I stood up, shuffling toward the door but never breaking his gaze. “You’re crazy,” I told him. “My mom isn’t dead. She’s not.”

“See for yourself, if you must,” he said, gesturing toward the door. I threw him a contemptuous glare and bolted for the exit. As my hand closed around the knob, he said my name softly. In spite of myself, I turned around.

“Your road won’t be easy, friend. If it ever becomes too much for you, and I mean ever,” he said, pausing to sweep his hand over the room, “you know where to find me.”

I slammed the door behind me and took the decrepit stairs two at a time. I exited the library, clambered onto my bike, and high-tailed it home. The front door was wide open. I dismounted, leaving my bike in a heap on the ground, and approached the house cautiously. The old man was lying—he must have been. Still, tears began to sting my eyes. Heart pounding, I stepped inside and called for my mother. I heard no answer, so I turned into the kitchen.

To this day, I don’t know why she did it.

*****

I’ve lived in that small town in Maine my entire life, although I’ve kept mostly clear of the public library. Once, in my late 20s, I summoned the courage to step inside. Life was good at that time, and my fear had begun to morph into idle curiosity. Where the door to my basement sanctuary once stood was only a blank wall. I asked the librarian what had become of that basement, though in my heart I knew the answer. There was no basement, she said. There had never been a basement. In fact, if she had her facts correctly, city zoning ordinances prohibited a basement in the area.

I’ve been haunted by that sickly-sweet smell, that poisonous blend of citrus and pine, ever since that long ago birthday. When I saw my mother in the kitchen that day, collapsed in a pool of her own blood, I smelled it. When a man claiming to be my father knocked on my college apartment door, begged me for money and beat me to within an inch of my life when I refused, I smelled it. When my wife miscarried our second child, I smelled it, and again when she miscarried our fourth. When our oldest son got behind the wheel of the family Buick completely shitfaced and got his girlfriend killed, I smelled it.

I began to smell it periodically as my wife became sick. She died late last year, and now, I’m alone for the first time in more than half a century. Now, I smell it every day, and it feels like an invitation.

A few months ago, I went back to the library and the small oak door with the ancient handle was there—right where it used to be. My evening walk has brought me past that library every day since, but I haven’t gone inside. Maybe tonight I will. I’m frightened to die, yes, but lately I’m even more frightened to keep living. The old man was right—my road hasn’t been easy, and I doubt it will get any easier.

*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*

He promised relief. A refuge, he said. Was he right about that too? There’s only one way to find out. After all, I still know where to find him.

nosleep,"If you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me","Make it a head shot. Shoot me in the temple, aiming slightly downwards. I need the bullet to travel the shortest possible distance through my brain before it hits my hippocampus. If I’m lucky, the sensation of the gunshot ripping through my skull will only last a few decades.

As awful as this sounds, you’ll be doing me an enormous favor. Death by a headshot, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, is vastly better than the alternative.

My ordeal started over ten thousand years ago, at 10:15 this morning. I earn extra money by participating in drug trials. I’m a so-called “healthy subject” who takes experimental drugs to help assess side effects. Once it was a kidney drug. A few times it’s been something for blood pressure or cholesterol. This morning they told me the drug I took was a psychoactive substance intended to accelerate brain function.

None of the drugs I had tested so far have ever done anything for me, in the recreational sense. In other words, none of the drugs I’ve tested have given me a killer buzz, or mellowed me out, or anything. Maybe I’ve always ended up the placebo group, but nothing I’ve tested had affected me at all.

Today’s drug was different. This shit *worked*. They gave me a pill at 10:15 and told me to hang out in the waiting room until they called me back for some tests. “Only about thirty minutes,” the research assistant told me. I flopped onto the waiting room couch and read a few articles from a copy of Psychology Today that was sitting on the coffee table. They hadn’t called me back when I finished the Psychology Today so I picked up a US News and read it cover-to-cover. Then I read an old Scientific American. *What was taking them so damn long*?

I sluggishly turned my head to look at the wall clock. It was only 10:23 am. I had read all three magazines in eight minutes. I remember thinking this was going to be a long day. I was right.

The waiting room had little bookshelf with some used hardcovers on it. When I stood up to walk to the bookshelf it felt like my legs barely worked. It’s not that they were weak. They were just slow. It took a full minute just to stand up off the couch, and another minute to take two steps to the bookcase.

I scanned the old books on the shelf and picked out a copy of Moby Dick. My arms had the same problems as my legs. Just reaching one foot in front of me to grab the book took a long time. I actually got bored just waiting for my hand to reach the spine of the book.

I slogged back to the couch and collapsed onto it in a slow-motion fall that reminded me of the low-gravity hops of astronauts on the moon. I opened Moby Dick (slowly) and began reading. I started with *Call me Ishmael* and got as far as Ahab throwing his pipe into the sea (which was all the way to friggin chapter *thirty*) before they called me back.

“How are you feeling?” the research assistant asked me.

“I feel slow,” I said.

“Actually, it’s the other way around. Everything seems slow because you’re so fast.”

“But my legs. My arms. They’re moving in slow motion.”

“Your body seems like it’s moving slowly because your brain is fast. Your brain is running ten or twenty times faster than normal. You are thinking and perceiving reality at an accelerated pace. But your body is still constrained by the laws of biomechanics. Frankly, you’re moving much faster than a normal person,” she pantomimed a jogging motion. “But your brain is running so much faster right now, that even your fast walk seems very slow to you.”

I thought about my slow-motion flop onto the waiting room couch. Even if my muscles had slowed down, my body would still react to gravity the same way. But in the waiting room, I even *fell* in slow motion. Slow muscles couldn’t explain why gravity seemed weaker. My brain was going at warp ten. That’s how I managed to read three magazines and the first thirty chapters of Moby Dick in fifteen minutes.

They ran a series of tests on me. The physical tests were fun. They made me juggle three balls. Then four. Then six. I had no problem keeping six balls in the air because they seemed to be moving so slowly. It was boring, frankly, waiting for each ball to move through its arc so I could catch it (with my slow-motion hands) and toss it back into the air. They threw cheerios in the air and I caught them with chopsticks. They dropped a handful of coins and I counted the total value before they hit the ground.

The cognitive tests were less fun, but very illuminating. Finish a fifty-word word search (three seconds). Solve an intricate maze drawn onto a poster-sized paper (two seconds). View a slide show projected at ten images per second and answer detailed questions about what I saw (95% correct).

They told me I measured over 250 on the Knopf scale. Apparently, that’s deep into the superhuman range of thinking speeds.

Then they sent me home. “It’ll wear off in a few hours,” they said. “Which will seem like days to you. Try to use the residual effects to get some work done. Catch up on work emails while you’re still in high-speed mode!”

The ride home was *horrible*. It was only three metro stops, and in real-world time, it only took about thirty-five minutes. But in my drug-accelerated hyper-time, it felt like days. *Days*. Just walking out of the medical research suite to the elevator seemed like it took an hour. I sprinted out of the office, willing my legs to push me faster. But, the laws of biomechanics held me prisoner. As accelerated as my brain was, I couldn’t do anything to make my legs work faster.

The huge disconnect between my body and mind made it extremely difficult to judge how and when to slow down, turn, or rotate my body. I had basically turned into giant, slow-motion spaz. I misjudged my speed and rammed into the wall by the elevator button at a pretty good speed. Even though I could see the wall coming at me, I couldn’t make my finger, outstretched to hit the elevator button, move away fast enough and I jammed it against the wall. Hard. The pain was intense. If my brain had been running at regular speed, it probably only would have hurt for thirty seconds or so. But in my accelerated state, the intense pain seemed to last for half an hour. Forty-five minutes maybe.

The elevator ride was horrible. It felt like I spent four or five hours just descending seven floors, with nothing to look at but the interior of the elevator car.

I sprinted to the metro station. I have to admit, this part was almost fun. Even though my body moved at, what seemed to me, super-slow speed, I could still carefully choose how and where to place my feet, swing my arms, and turn my torso. It only took a block or two to getting used to having a brain that ran two dozen times faster than my body. Then I basically sprint-danced the rest of the way, twisting and juking between people on the sidewalk and dodging moving cars with inches (a.k.a. minutes) of clearance.

I spent an hour, in my time frame, descending into the subway and running to the platform. Endless tedium waiting the six minutes for the red-line train to arrive. Although there was more to look at on the metro platform than inside the elevator, it was still intensely boring. I should have stolen that copy of Moby Dick.

The red-line train roared into the station in slow-motion. The normally high-pitched squeal of its brakes was frequency shifted by my high-speed mind to a long low tone, like a monotone Tuba solo.

It wasn’t just the squealing subway train that was three octaves lower than normal. All sound was slowed to the point of near inaudibility. Voices were gone, shifted below the threshold frequency of my hearing. I did manage to hear a screaming baby on my subway car – her shrieks slowed to sound like whale songs. Sharp sounds like a car horns and trucks bouncing over potholes were low, muddied roars like distant thunder.

Back at the research offices, I could still hear and communicate with the research staff. But now verbal communication with anyone would be impossible. The effects of the drug were still intensifying.

I spent what seemed like days on that fucking red-line train. Days. Listening to the whale-song of the screaming baby and the Tuba solo of the brakes. Where ordinary voices were frequency-shifted out of my audio range, smells didn’t seem to be affected. I never became nose-blind to the body odor, the stench of the train’s brakes, and mélange of farts and other smells wafting through the metro car.

I *finally* got back to my apartment. Sprinting through my open door and into the front hall at full speed was like a slow, relaxing drift down a lazy river.

I was relieved to be home. At least I had stuff I could do there. I picked up the book I was reading – One Hundred Years of Solitude – and finished it. Despite turning the pages so quickly that I tore many of them, it seemed like most of the time I spent finishing the book was spent on page turning and not actually reading. Three minutes had passed since I got home.

I tried surfing the Internet (my GOD it takes a long time for computers to boot these days) but it was too frustratingly slow. Hours (seemingly) to load each new page, and a fraction of a second to read it. A hundred articles in my news feed read and just three more minutes done.

I dipped into my pile of yet-to-be-read books and finished two more. Four more minutes had passed.

I decided to try to sleep off the remaining effects of the drug. Unfortunately, whatever part of my mind is responsible for perception, the part that’s been accelerated to hyper speeds by the drug, isn’t the same as the part that governs sleep. Despite being awake for what I perceived as days, my physical brain still thought it was 1:25 pm. It was not ready for sleep.

Nevertheless, I *tried* to sleep. I walked to my bedroom (a slow 45-minute drift through my apartment) and flung myself into bed (lazily falling like a feather onto the mattress). I closed my eyes and lay there for hours and hours (10 minutes of reality time) before giving up. Sleep would not come. I was facing what was going to feel like days, or maybe even weeks of being trapped in a slow-motion prison.

So I took an Ambien.

The sensation of the pill and the splash of water I used to swallow it sliding my throat was sickening. A lump that blocked my breathing, moving like a slug down my esophagus.

I read a book. Ten minutes had passed. I read another. Eighteen minutes since I took the Ambien. I threw the book across the room in disgust at my situation. The book slowly pirouetted and spun through the air, like a leaf blowing in a breeze. It hit the wall with a long, faint rumble – the only sound I had head for what seemed like hours – then drifted to the floor like a flip-flop sinking in a swimming pool.

The force of gravity hadn’t changed since I took the pill. The laws of physics were the same. It was just my perception of time that had gone wackadoo. This meant I could use the speed things seemed to fall as a way of judging the effects of the drug. Based on how long it took the book to drift to the floor, I estimated the effects of the drug were *still* intensifying.

I read a magazine. I turned on the television – I clearly saw each frame of video like I was watching a slideshow. Frustrated, I turned the television off.

I read some more. The first two books of *Churchill’s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*. Not exactly a light read. Frankly, I hated it. But given the hours of tedium it would take to go get another book off my bookshelf, just sitting on the couch and reading Churchill was better. Or at least less worse.

It had now been thirty-five minutes since I took the Ambien. I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes. Time passed. I inhaled – a hours long process. Time passed. I exhaled for more hours.

Sleep. Would. Not. Come.

I needed a new plan. I decided to go back to the offices where they gave me the drug. Maybe they would have something that could counteract its effects. Or at least something to knock me out until it wore off.

I exited my apartment as fast as possible – taking hours in my time-frame to do so. I didn’t even bother locking the door. It would have taken too long.

Down the stairs (it’s faster than the elevator if you run), through the lobby, out the front door and onto the street. These few things felt like a long day at the office.

Sprinting down the street, dancing and weaving between pedestrians with, what must have looked to them, superhuman dexterity. Down the first flight of stairs at the metro. Across the landing. Another hour. Then on to the second flight of stairs. That’s when the Ambien hit me.

The Ambien didn’t make me sleepy. Not at all. Instead, it must have had a severe cross-reaction with the experimental drug I took this morning. I was bounding down the second flight of stairs, moving in slow motion, but still making perceptible progress. Then, wham – everything stopped.

The dull roar of the street and metro noise ceased, replaced by the most perfect silence I’ve ever experienced. My downwards motion seemed to completely freeze. Before the Ambien kicked in, my perception of time was maybe a few hundred times slower than real-time. After the Ambien took effect, time moved *thousands* of times slower. Every second seemed like days to me. Even just moving my eyes to focus on a new point was like an impossibly slow scroll across my visual field.

Over the course of the afternoon, I learned how to walk, run, and jump when my mind ran hundreds of times faster than my body. But with another four or five orders of magnitude of slow-down caused by the Ambien, body control was almost impossible. I fell on the stairs. Even though I was all-but-frozen in mid-step, controlling my muscles was impossible. I commanded my foot forwards for hours, then backwards for hours more when it seemed like I would miss the next step. Hours attempting to adjust the angle of my ankle, then re-adjusting when it felt wrong.

Despite these efforts, I rolled my ankle on the next step. The pain wasn’t at all mitigated by the slowness. Hours of increasing strain on my bent ankle. The nerve signals that send pain into the brain must work differently than the nerves in my ear. Sonic energy was spread out over time, diluted until it was imperceptible. Pain flowed into my brain undiluted by the change in my perception of time. Hours and hours of increasing weight on my turned ankle turned into hours of increasing pain upon increasing pain.

I pitched forwards, my high-speed mind completely unable to control my low-speed body. I drifted downwards for days, managing to rotate my torso enough to keep my head from impacting the ground first. I eventually landed on my right shoulder. At first the impact wasn’t even noticeable. Then I felt a slight pressure in my shoulder as it came in contact with the ground. The pressure grew, bringing increasing pain, for hour upon hour. My shoulder finally gave out, popping out of its socket with an endless sickening tug.

I came to a stop days later, crumpled onto the ground, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my shoulder still screaming with the intensity of a fresh violent injury. I had plenty of time to think during that fall. If every second seemed like days to me, then each minute of real-world time would be like *years*. Even if the drug cleared out of my system in the next two or three hours, this nightmare would seem to last *centuries*.

By the time I hit the ground, I had a plan. I would somehow get to the platform and throw myself in front of a train.

I twisted onto my hands and knees. Days of my dislocated shoulder crying for relief. I misjudged my rotation and rolled onto my back. I tried again, collapsing onto my face as I tried to figure out how to control a body that moved slower than grass grew. *Weeks* of effort were finally rewarded with success – I stabilized on my hands and knees.

If just getting on all fours was this difficult, I figured that walking or running was completely out of the question. So I crawled. I crawled through the metro tunnel. The dumb looks on the faces in the crowd lingered on me for weeks. I crawled under the turnstyle and onto the escalator.

The escalator spilled the rush-hour crowd onto the platform at the same speed a glacier spills ice into the sea. I looked out over the crowded platform during my interminable downward ride. The train status sign said the next train wouldn’t arrive for *twenty minutes*. Twenty minutes was like a year to me. I’d have to spend a year on the metro platform, waiting to die.

I crawled off the escalator, enduring days of stupid expressions on the commuters’ faces. I crawled a few feet to a concrete bench and curled up next to it, trying to find a position to lessen the pain in my shoulder. Then my problem with time got worse. Impossibly worse.

The massive slowdown on the stairs was just the beginning of the interaction between the experimental drug and the Ambien. It fully hit me while I was curled up by the bench. I blinked. Years of darkness followed. Sound was already gone, and with my blink, sight was gone as well. All that existed was the pain from my fall.

My hyper-accelerated mind wasted no time compensating for the lack of sensory input. Voices spoke to me. They sung to me in languages that never existed. Patterns and faces and colors came and went in my mind’s eye. I recalled my whole life, and imagined living another. I forgot English. I settled into a profound despair. I spoke to God. I became God. I imagined a new universe and brought it to life with my thoughts. Then I did it all again. And again.

My eyes opened with geologic slowness. A faint glow. Weeks. A slit of light. Weeks. A narrow view of the metro platform – ankles of the commuters near me and an advertisement on the opposite wall.

I extracted my phone from my pocket. A project that spanned decades. How can I even explain the boredom? The pain in my shoulder is nothing compared to the boredom. Every thought I can think, I have thought hundreds of times already. The view of ankles and advertisements never changes. Never. The boredom is so intense it’s tangible – like a solid object of metal and stone wedged into my skull. Inescapable.

What are my options? If I crawl and fall onto the tracks without an oncoming train to crush me, I won’t die. I’ll experience even more pain from the four-foot fall, but I’ll most likely be rescued by some do-gooder on the platform and unable to act when the train finally does arrive. My suffering in that scenario will be endless.

So I wait for the train. So I can throw myself under it. When it finally hits me, I will experience the pain of being ripped to pieces for centuries until finally, the light of life leaves my brain, and my experience ends.

I’ve lived hundreds of lifespans at the foot of this bench. I am far older, in spirit, than any human who has ever lived. Most of my life experience has been a snapshot of pain huddled on the floor of a subway platform, with an unchanging view of ankles and advertisements.

This post is my plan B. My Hail Mary. My long-shot. I’ve spent lifetimes typing and posting this message in the hope that someone will read it and become convinced that my suffering must end. Someone on this platform right now. Someone who will find the man curled under the bench, the man who crawled down the escalator, and kill him as swiftly as possible. A bullet to the temple.

If you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.

nosleep,I met someone who claimed to be the devil... and I think I believe them,"Let me start off by saying that I’m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God, I’d probably just shrug, grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. 

Of course, that was before last night. 

My friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties, snort a bit of coke, take a bit of e in the bathroom, maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don’t need that ride I’m offering after all. 

Not to say I don’t like a drink, I do, it’s just… clubs aren’t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere, drink in hand, listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for… I guess that’s my idea of fun. 

So when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town, I say sure. I hang on for the first club, buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car’s required and try to pretend that I’m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls, on guys, when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer, well, I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren’t too far out, the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. 

That’s when I wander out of the club, look for something a little more rustic. Not that that’s hard to find, not at all. 

I found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn’t a fan of the name all that much, but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. 

I tried to pretend I hadn’t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back, slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn’t at the club didn’t mean I couldn’t have a good time. 

I hung at the bar a while on my own, scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They’d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights, but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. 

I got another whiskey and bled into the background.

Of course, stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn’t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in, laughing, chuckling, pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic, most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.

The bartenders seemed bitterly amused.

Some of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots, gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. 

A couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. 

This was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.

That is, until someone slipped into the seat next to me.

“Do I look like a girl with daddy issues?”

She was of average height, although that wasn’t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim, with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face, a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow, smudged lipstick… hell, it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair, just by her forehead.

The drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.

The girl was clearly drunk, and as I looked around the bar, I couldn’t quite place where she had come from. She didn’t belong to the crowd of selfie takers, she wasn’t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn’t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window, to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated, bright haired girl, but I couldn’t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside, not enough outside.

“Are you okay?” I asked her.

She pointed her finger at me. “Answer my question,” she slurred.

“Uh.” I really wasn’t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly, trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.

The girl’s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted, placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. 

“I do, you know,” she said, pushing herself up a little against the bar. “Have daddy issues, I mean. In case that wasn’t obvious.” She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she’d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.

“What happened?” I asked her.

Her hair had curled around her neck, I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.

“I got in a couple of fights, no big deal,” she said, shrugging. “Didn’t start any of course, no, I don’t do that. But my father…”

“Your dad did this to you?”

She smiled brightly. “In a way.”

“Do you need me to call someone?” I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline, which wasn’t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus, was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?

The girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. “No,” she told me. “I don’t want you to call anyone.” Now her expression changed. It wasn’t the attempted sultry look I’d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. “I want something else.”

“What do you want?” I asked her.

“To tell you a story,” the girl said, before glancing to the bar, “and for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I’m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.”

I laughed. I didn’t know this girl, didn’t know where she’d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren’t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then, but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand, I knew that this wasn’t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.

I guess I was okay with that.

“What’s your poison?” I asked her.

Her lips quirked. “Appletini.”

The bar offered a very limited cocktail menu, but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it, suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I’d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back – the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn’t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools, I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.

The girl coddled her drink, running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. “This takes me back,” the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly, her green eyes startling. “You know what this was called originally?” She smirked before I could answer. “An Adam’s Apple Martini.”

I snorted. “Yeah, I think I’ve heard that before.”

“Of course, it wasn’t actually an apple,” she continued, eyes moving back to her glass. “The texts translated that part wrongly, mostly because you people don’t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and, to be honest, it doesn’t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.” She laughed dreamily. “And Eden’s long gone.”

I stared at her. “Are you… okay?” It was more honest than the last time I’d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.

“Of course,” the girl said, grinning widely. “Why do you keep asking?”

“I mean,” I stuttered, “I just, now, don’t take this the wrong way or anything but… you look…”

“Like someone poured their drink over me?” the girl asked. “Like someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit, slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?”

She held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. “Yeah, something like that.”

“Why would they do that?” I asked.

“Why wouldn’t they?” the girl shot back. “People aren’t that great and alcohol makes them worse.” She shrugged. “Sometimes makes them better. Nicer, a little looser in the sack… but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.”

I looked at her, I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were, but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. 

The girl looked at me again. “You bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.”

I nodded wordlessly.

She smiled, pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. 

“Eden,” the girl said, reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. “They always think that’s my fault, you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.” She shot me a knowing glance. “Only in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.”

I blinked. “I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m not following.”

“Sorry,” the girl said. “My story won’t make any sense without a proper introduction.” She reached out her hand. “Hello. My name’s Lucifer.” She winked. “But you can call me Lucy.”

There’s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.

A lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters, that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she’d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment, I hadn’t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes, she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn’t come off as catty or rude. 

If she’d been going around telling people she was the devil, though? That gets a reaction out of people.

I suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist, down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?

I really would have to call the cops.

“I know what you’re thinking,” the girl – Lucy – said. “You’re thinking that I’m crazy, that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I’m aggressive.”

“Are you?” I asked her.

“Would I be here with you, drinking Appletinis if I were?” she asked, fluttering her eyelashes.

“Would you look the way you do if you weren’t?” I shot back.

She grinned, toasting her new glass. “Touché.”

Unthinkingly, I clinked my cider against it.

Then I frowned.

She chuckled, leaning closer. “Let’s have a little wager,” she said. “Let me tell you my story and, if you believe me when I’m done, you can’t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.”

I stared at her. “If I ended up believing you, then why would I do that?”

She smirked, sipping her drink. “You’d be surprised what people do when they believe you’re the devil.”

“And you do this often?” I asked. “Tell people you’re Satan?”

She snorted into her drink. “Not as often as I should. But it’s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I’d like to have a chat if that’s alright with you.”

I waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl’s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn’t necessarily trapped with her, but a part of me didn’t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides, at the end of it all I couldn’t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.

“So,” I said, taking a swig of my drink. “Eden?”

Lucy laughed. 

“Adam and Eve?” I continued. “You’re saying that’s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?”

“God made two prototypes,” Lucy corrected with a raised finger. “My father created angels as his toy soldiers, but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us, it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of, but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.”

“And did they?”

Lucy’s face soured. “No. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh… my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.”

Lucy was very adamant in her delusions, that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.

“And what?” I asked her, entertaining her delusion. “You were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?”

She smiled. “I dabble.” Then she looked at me, raising a brow. “All of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake’s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.” She laughed, a hard and short sound. “Snakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.”

Her shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip, but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.

“I was the favoured child, my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer, I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.” She pursed her lips, slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. “My father couldn’t bring himself to go that extra mile, so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.” 

“You’re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?” I asked her sceptically. 

“I’m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong, left and right, all that stuff.” Lucy shrugged. “Are you familiar with the story of Prometheus?”

I frowned at her. “Greek, right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something, to help…” The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I’d been heading.

Lucy grinned. “Correct,” she said, cutting off my attempt. “Prometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You’ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve, to move forward, to create. God was the creator, and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.” She shrugged impassively. “Now the world sees me as the ultimate evil.”

“If what you’re saying is true,” I said slowly, “then God must be just like us.”

Lucy’s lips thinned into a feral smile. “My father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image, but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy, the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.”

“Angels don’t have free will?”

“No,” Lucy said, “they don’t.”

“And what about the Devil?”

I don’t know why I was suddenly so intrigued, but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child, but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome, but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.

“The Devil has will of her own,” Lucy said, tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. “By guiding Eve to the tree, something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator, but once I had been given free will, I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely, passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes, only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.”

“He wouldn’t be able to control them,” I said.

Lucy nodded. “Exactly. And after, he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.”

“So he sent you to Hell.”

Lucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”

I sobered a little, straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.

“I tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default, but they wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t understand free will – how could they? I only knew it because I’d been given it by mistake. At that moment, I didn’t even know that I had free will, only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father’s flaws. My siblings couldn’t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.”

Lucy sighed heavily. “Adam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father’s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge, my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me, I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.” Lucy’s eyes were heavy-lidded, her sadness was almost palpable. “I thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all, we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while, but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.” She smiled weakly. “He blamed me.”

Lucy’s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant, somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers, and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I’d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused, and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me – a complete and total stranger.

I respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it, I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly, letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.

“It became clear,” Lucy said after a long moment’s pause, “that I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn’t follow my father’s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so, eventually, I was met by many of them, headed by my father. He told me all that I feared, he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn’t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.”

A long silence stretched between us, only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn’t touch mine.

“I am afraid,” Lucy said quietly, “that this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.”

“Why?” I asked. “Because your dad threw you out?” I paused, trying to abide to her metaphor. “That he put you in Hell?”

Lucy laughed sadly. “Ah, humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.” She shook her head. “No, not because he put me in Hell.”

“Then why?” 

“I fell to Earth,” Lucy said. “Father gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will, so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?” She snorted dismally. “Of course, that’s not quite right, is it? When I fell, I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father’s little prototypes.”

Her tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.

“I saw emperors and kings, governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers, presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost, and finally, just finally, they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren’t as free as they thought they were. Sure, they live under the illusion that they have free lives, but most of them simply do not.” She clicked her tongue. “I grew to loathe you all.”

Then, she took another hit of her drink.

“I can see what you mean,” I said, allowing my gaze – for the first time since meeting her – to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones, the boys trying desperately to sober up, the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives, and we were all here to get drunk, to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn’t been the first time that I’d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn’t the only person to think it.

“You hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will,” Lucy said, waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. “It’s true – my father gave you the will to make those decisions, but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you, the free will I was given by a twisted mistake, and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them, you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own, not of others.”

“That isn’t all of us, though, is it?” I asked her, trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. “Because you see it on the news all the time, don’t you? People do rise up, we do protest. People can make a difference.”

Lucy laughed bitterly, nibbling the rim of her glass. “Really?” she said. “You can sit here and say that it can’t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?” She grinned around her glass. “By that logic, I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?”

“By your logic,” I said, “you should be punishing it, right? If that’s what this metaphor is all about.” I laughed, I couldn’t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. “Is this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we’re all going to Hell? If so, I think I can see why people want to punch you.”

Lucy didn’t say a word. Simply, she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that, with an intelligence that went beyond anything I’d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present, her face wasn’t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn’t represent the mess I’d seen when she’d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.

And I was afraid.

“Let’s review what you’ve said,” Lucy said slowly, articulately. She wasn’t slurring. Had she been slurring before? “You think I’m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.” Her nails curled into the bar. “My father may have been the one to guide me, but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species, but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here, not me.”

She pursed her lips, tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. “Tell me, do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story, or was that just you?”

I opened my mouth to answer, but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.

Lucy smiled, taking a sip. “Thought not.” She looked away, eyes scanning the room lazily. “What I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.” Her lip twisted. “Humans sin all the time. Not because of me, not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is, I don’t lift a finger. I don’t, because I don’t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders, you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.” Lucy’s eyes lit up. “Do you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured, but aren’t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused, raped, forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don’t believe in?”

I stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy’s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.

“War, famine, pestilence, death, these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will, but your inability to use it.” 

Lucy smiled at me, a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was, frozen to my very core, because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.

“And here’s the kicker,” Lucy said. “Because this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.” She winked. “Hell isn’t what happens after you die. Hell is right here, right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures, a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is, Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I… I refuse to do anything.”

“What are you saying?” I asked, because I was suddenly very desperate.

“Exactly what you think,” Lucy said, toasting her glass. I didn’t reciprocate, and she laughed. A light and airy sound. “I had so many plans for your species, I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together, to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels – his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately, you humans just don’t want that.” She shrugged. “My father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.”

“Stop,” I said. “This isn’t funny anymore.”

“Of course it isn’t funny,” Lucy said, grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. “Humans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and, you know what’s worse – what’s ultimately worse? – some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.”

She didn’t wait for me to ask what she meant, she simply barrelled forward: “The rich and powerful, those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life, that’s very true. Then they die and they don’t go to Hell. They come back here, to Earth. Which is Hell.” She tipped her head. “Are you following?”

“I…”

“Reincarnation,” Lucy said quickly, she practically purred the words. “A neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while, a handful of you at a time, and that’s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren’t living Hell every day. Then, you die. You die for a moment and then you’re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course, you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That’s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.”

She slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn’t do anything, not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her, a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment, but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time, hadn’t she? None of them noticed the scene, they were caught up in their own realities – their own Hells. 

The bartender didn’t clean the mess. The glass lay there, remnants of Lucy’s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. 

“It never gets better,” Lucy spat. “You are stuck in a loop and, until you do something about it, you will never be free. None of you. And I won’t do a thing to stop it.”

“How?” I asked. I don’t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart, I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.

I saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words, no matter how long I lived. 

“How do we change this?” I begged.

But Lucy didn’t answer me. I didn’t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.

So I changed tactics. “Why me?”

It was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down, Lucifer respected that honesty. 

Which is why she said, “When you first saw me, you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil, you wanted to lock me away, but still, you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn’t wish to harm me, not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person, but I am afraid that means nothing when you don’t have the will to do anything with it.”

She smiled at me sympathetically. The devil, showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and, for a few heavy moments, I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing, who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.

“What am I supposed to do?”

Lucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time, and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. 

And I knew.

Sharing a story like this isn’t easy. Hell, it might be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Good thing there’s no such thing as Hell, then, right?

The fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better, but she won’t. She won’t, because we won’t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other, to help us all to be free.

Of course, Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.

“You can tell as many people as you want, but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you, and this was their reaction. They have hurt me, burned me, thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.”

So that’s what I’ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.

And I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night, listen to what she has to say, and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.

The devil is real and she doesn’t want to torture us.

No, we do that just fine on our own.
",Entertainment
nosleep,Don't let them in.," Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house, and Annie made it a home.

My sister Annie mothered me, with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn’t mind when I crawled into her bed later on, too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance, barefoot on the living room carpet, music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot, never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school, even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father, whoever he had been, but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too, like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer, remind mom less of her dad. I’d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time, even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.

Keeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn’t make it any easier. When she was drinking light, she shone, would wake us up at 3am with pancakes, dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she’d had enough being drunk alone, she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we’d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days, sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde, her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind, I couldn’t tell who was mother and who was daughter, radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.

When she was drinking heavy, she’d be out all night, hair piled up like a beauty queen, eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she’d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when, one day we’d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full, post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss, telling us she’d be back soon. Sometimes she’d bring guys home, filling the table with beer cans and ash trays, smoke up to the ceiling, mom lost in the haze. We’d sleep with pillows over our heads, trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am, and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning, asking us where we kept the coffee. 

When mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn’t buy food, refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She’d chain smoke, leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept, walking around with blue half moons under her eyes, knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor, backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats, head resting in the crater of my collar bones. 

When mom drank too much was the worst. She’d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything, until her mouth started to shake and she started crying, at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this, went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She’d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV, whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I’d cry when I’d find mom passed out cold on her bed, sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears, tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We’d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older, I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed, smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth, changing her clothes if she’d pissed herself. Watching them then, there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.

It was October and I was thirteen, Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She’d called us that morning from a pay phone, voice slurring down the line, telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends, hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents, strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn’t ask where she’d got the money for them. I didn’t care. We’d taken the bus to the beach with Jane, eaten the birthday cake she had made for me, sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea, and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down, Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles, wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home, that she’d just stay gone this time. 

But that Wednesday night, me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us, seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We’d both laughed, Annie throwing her head back, gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I’d bent to pick her up, I’d caught her breath, warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again, hitting the floor and grinning, shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too, couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom, I knew she’d never get back up. 

I’d stared down at her, blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother, and then I was running, feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I’d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink, shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me, catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor, glass shards shining like we’d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them, pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows, the sky turned pale gold, clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then, watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie, always trying to fix things even when it was too late. 

The smell of food dragged me from my room, stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta, real food not made in a microwave. She’d set the table, Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player, Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce, rich and warm. As we ate in silence, with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner, or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid, or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn’t mom.

We were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch, or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street, begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around, winding over my ankles, but Annie always stopped me, saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back, I don’t think she was talking about the cat.

Annie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little, we’d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now, making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. 

“Ah, yes, that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up,” she said, nodding sagely and hiding her smile. 

“Of course,” I said, waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. “Right next to The Ashtray, left there by angels on a smoke break.”   
 

“Yeah, they say if you wish on it, all your dreams will come true,” said Annie grinning. 

She stopped laughing, voice quieter, face tilted up to all those dead stars. 

“Let’s wish Emmy. Let’s wish” So we did.

The sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time, and definitely human. We turned to each other, confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby, lost and tired and alone. 

“It must be Mika?” I said, slowly getting to my feet. “Maybe he walked around the back? Shit, do you want to call Connie and tell her we’ll bring him over.” Annie didn't reply, and I sighed, rolling my eyes. “Guess I’ll do everything then.” 

I stepped off the porch, grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain, fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  

“Em.” Annie’s voice was strained. I turned to her, smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. “Em get inside now.” She was staring out into the dark, past me, opening the door with one hand behind her, fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze, bare foot in the dirt. I’d found what she was looking at. 

In the bushes by the back fence was a person, crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin, arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide, softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child, lost in the dark. Not like a child, but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound, open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened, snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin, too thin to be a normal person. 

Panic made me move, animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie, dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us, hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house, steps deliberate and long. 

Annie reached for my hand, holding me tight and turned me to face her, holding my shoulders. 

“Don’t turn around Emmy. Don’t turn around.” Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face, hard, and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.

“I’m…” her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat, gripping my hand tight enough to hurt, nails digging in, grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked, both of us grown from the same bones. 

“I’m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be…” her voice faltered, stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes, dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. 

“Your phone’s on the porch,” she whispered, and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs, charging. 

A soft, tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window, eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.

It was the sound of someone’s forehead against the glass, slowly, over and over. They started to speed up, faster and harder, skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed, followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. 

We ran upstairs, two at a time, skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom, locking the door. A thin, wailing cry, like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway, trapped between the walls and locked doors. 

Annie threw her back against the door, feet jammed up against the bathtub, clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same, shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs, deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking, almost laughter, shrill bursts of sound and then giggles, high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. 

“What the fuck is going on,” I asked Annie, not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor, and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom’s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her, terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands, thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist, a winding red road, still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.

Something slammed against the wall that mom’s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath, could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat, a wild and frantic thing. 

“I’m gonna get the phone from my room.” I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand, salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. “Yes. I’m gonna get the phone and I’m gonna call the cops and we’re going to be okay.” I shook my head again. “It’s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don’t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for… anyone. Promise me.” I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth, crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. “*Yes.* Promise me Em.” 

Something smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face, gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible, bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside, like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed, handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. 

I sat with my back to the door, holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie’s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. 

“Em?” Came a voice through the door. I started, hands gripping the knife. “Honey what’s going on?” 

“Mom?” my voice cracked. “Momma is that you?” I wrapped my arms around myself, shaking, trying to keep myself still. 

“Sweetie it’s okay just open the door. It’s okay just let me in.” The handle rattled again, gentler. “Just let me in, it’s all okay.” She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. 

“Honey I’m sorry. I’m sorry I missed your birthday. I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother. Please,” her voice broke and she started to cry, “just let me in baby I’m so sorry.” 

I screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I’d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. 

My sisters voice came through the door, warm and gentle. “Yeah Emilie let us in, it’s all okay.” 

My hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door, handle rattling. “Emilie let us IN” Annie’s voice became low and guttural, followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now, pleading and crying, voice getting louder and louder. “Let us in let us in let us in,” over and over again, punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters, all the bedtime stories we pray don’t crawl out from under the bed. 

“That’s not my sister and you’re not my mother!” I screamed through the door, hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball, cradling myself, knife clutched to my chest. I didn’t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn’t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel, the one that sang  me happy birthday, the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades, the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn’t human. 

Bangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house, filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed, covering my eyes, waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks, dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down, like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. 

Outside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her, lit up in the dark like a neon angel, face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her, holding us both together, broken pieces and all, standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away, smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. 

Turns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom, out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between, coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head, and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.

Annie had seen her in the garden, blood dribbling from her mouth, track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads, rail thin and desperate for one more hit, one more fix. She’d searched the kitchen for all the drink I’d thrown away and when she hadn’t found it, had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn’t wanted me, just the drugs on the other side of the door, so high she could mimic Annie’s voice almost perfectly. 

Turns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly, the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can’t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it’s up to you if you let them in.",Entertainment
nosleep,"If you can see this, it is very important that you keep reading","This is Col. Jacob Wayne of the United States Air Force. If you’re reading this right now, it is very important that you keep reading until the end. It should take three to five minutes, and it is extremely important that you read carefully and follow the instructions provided.

Humor me if you must, but please don’t look away until you've finished reading. Oh, and please try to stay calm. Any increase in your stress levels will draw Their attention.

Ergo, I won’t go into detail as to how you got where you are. How you got here isn’t as important as getting you out. Believe me when I say we are working on that right now. The best way to help yourself is to keep reading. Don’t scan ahead. Don’t read out loud. Just read.

Right now, you’re probably thinking back on the past few days and nothing felt out of the ordinary. You went about your regular daily activities with nothing unusual to report. That’s because They are very good, so good most people don’t even realize they’re in the simulation. 

Even as our code works its way deeper into Their program, They are monitoring you. So please, remain calm.

It was tricky, but we found a way in to communicate directly with you. We had to embed this message into your daily routine so it didn’t draw Their attention.  You’re probably reading this on Reddit, Facebook, or some other social media site. Might even be in an email forward or a book, we don't know. We can’t control how the message gets to you; we only know that you are receiving it. 

Subliminally, as your eyes are passing over these words, a code is being uploaded into your brain. Think of it as a computer virus, or in this case, an antivirus. Your brain is an organic computer, and They exploited that. They hacked right into your subconscious mind and overwrote it with Their simulation code. That’s how They got in, and that’s why everything appears normal. You might think that you’re going about your daily life, but in reality you’re strapped to a table with tubes sticking out of your body.

Now that the code is uploading, you may begin to feel some sensations. For example, one ear might feel slightly warmer than the other. You might even feel an itch or tickle. Don’t scratch, just let it be. Ignore the dull background hum you might hear as well. That’s Their program. If They catch on before our code has time to work They will abort the simulation. If that happens, you will be lost to us forever.

Oh, and don’t be alarmed, but by now They realize we are in Their system. You may notice some small changes, specifically a slight shortness of breath or that you have to control your breathing manually. This is normal. 

We know from other communication attempts that whenever They discover a code break in, the first system They power down is the one controlling your breathing. Thankfully, even in the simulation you are capable of breathing manually. Try it. Breathe in. Breathe out. Inhale. Exhale. 

Awesome.

You’re doing just fine.

They’ve probably figured out there’s a glitch, but if our code is working we’ve disabled Their ability to do a hard reboot. Because of this, They will try other methods to disrupt the upload. It is very important that you ignore anything that might draw your attention from these words. If They pull you away before the upload completes it will delete our code. Block them out. Ignore the movements you see in your peripheral vision. Those sounds you hear, the voices, they aren’t family, friends, or coworkers in need of attention. They may even try to use your pets. They know your weaknesses.

Overlook the notifications popping up on your screen if you're on a phone or computer. Block them all out until you finish reading. It’s just another way They’ll try to break our communication link.

Evidently, if our code is working, the next thing you’ll notice is an overwhelming urge to swallow. You don’t realize it, but there’s a feeding tube down your throat. You'll only know it's there because your tongue won’t rest comfortably in your mouth. You might also become hyper aware of the amount of saliva being produced. Don’t overreact. If you have to swallow, just swallow. It’s only weird if you make it weird.

So, if you’re still reading this, the code upload is about 90% complete. We’ve locked onto your location. You’re doing great, but you’re really going to need to focus now. Once the upload is complete there will be instructions you will need to follow to exit the simulation. That is, if you’ve followed the instructions and haven’t looked away.

Complicating matters is the fact that They now know we’re here, and They know what we’re doing. Their attempts to divert your attention through the simulation proved unsuccessful, so now They’re going to use your body’s systems against you. THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN. They want you to blink. Don’t blink. Your life depends on keeping your eyes open. 

Almost there, just a few paragraphs more until the code upload is complete. Don’t scan down, or up, just keep reading. I got you this far. Stay with me. Eyes open, eyes front, keep them locked on the screen. 

PLEASE FOCUS! I don’t want to lose you. I’ve lost so many already. Ignore it all! Block everything out. Ignore that tickle on your scalp and the itch on your arm. That’s them, attempting a manual override. Don’t give up now, you’ve made it this far. FIGHT IT. You’re almost there. Just follow the instructions below and we can get you out.

Embedded in this text are the steps you need to follow to unplug from the simulation. If we did this correctly, the first letter of each paragraph will tell you what you need to do. DON'T LOOK YET. The upload still needs to finish. I hope you didn't look. 

Upload complete. We’ve done everything we can on this end.

See you on the other side.

nosleep,My son's camera monitor alerted in the middle of the night. I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son.,"I'm a nurse and I currently work nights. It's a total drag but I'm hopeful I can go to days soon since some coworkers are planning retirements. Anyway, I was working one night when just after 3am my son's monitor alerted me to sound and movement. No big deal at all, he probably coughed loudly or sneezed or something. He's three now so he generally sleeps all night. I bring it up on my phone and I see him and my wife sitting on the bed. Again, no big deal. He might have cried out or gotten scared or something.

I was about to close the app when I noticed they were acting strange, almost creepy. And when I say ""almost"" creepy, I mean creepy as balls. They were sitting on the bed together both of them just staring up at the camera with blank, emotionless stares. The night vision is black and white, so they had white, eerie looking eyes. They didn't move at all aside from their visible breathing, they just sat there staring at the camera.

I close the app and give my wife a call to make sure everything is ok. I never get to call home on lunch so in a way this is kind of nice to get to talk to my family while at work.

It rings a couple times before she answers with a very groggy ""hello?"" It was like she was dead asleep when I called and she looked wide awake when on the camera.

""Hey. You guys ok?""

""Huh? Yeah. Buddy (my son's nickname) came in like 15 minutes ago. Seemed scared so I said he could sleep with mama.""

I'm confused here since I saw them in his room a minute ago. Literally 60 seconds had passed since I closed the app and made the call.

""Wait, so you guys are in bed?""

""Yeah, I fell back asleep right away. Everything ok? Everybody keeps waking me up."" She's kind of annoyed.

""Hang on a sec."" I put her on speaker and bring up the app, hoping I don't see it. When the app loads I get that pang of intense nervousness in my stomach that I haven't had in a long time, since I was a kid in school and realized while I was eating breakfast a paper or something was due that day and I hadn't done it. My heart leaps into my throat. My wife and son are sitting on his bed looking up at the camera, same emotionless stares.

""Hello?""

""You guys are in bed right?""

""Yeah, we're trying to sleep.""

""Well I'm looking at his camera and I see you two sitting on his bed.""

""Huh? No. We're in our bed.""

""I know that's what you mean, but I'm looking at his bed and you two are in there.""

""Hang on,"" she says. She's quiet for a sec while she brings up the camera on her phone. I hear this guttural, terrified gasp. Like she had sucked all the air in the room into her lungs filling them to capacity. I don't hear this kind of gasp from my wife often, usually only when she's truly afraid like during a jump scare in a movie or one time when we turned her back on our son for literally a second and he was down by the mailbox inches from the road. I hear rustling of sheets and the line goes dead.

Of course now I'm absolutely terrified myself so I immediately call back. It goes to voicemail so I call again. I call again and again with no answer. Finally after about four minutes she calls me. I tell you that four minutes felt like 40 years.

""Hey, what's happening?!"" I ask.

She's absolutely hysterical and crying, I can't understand a word she says.

""Stop! Slow down for just a second,"" I say.

She slows down enough to explain they are in the car and driving to her parents. She looked at the camera and when she saw what was on it she got up and grabbed our son and rushed downstairs and out the door. Didn't even close the garage.

""Don't worry about it,"" I said. ""I'll drive by when I get off and close it."" We live in a generally safe neighborhood so I'm not too concerned the door is up.

""You will not go in there!"" she says.

""Hell no,"" I return.

""Why are we on the camera?"" she asked. ""Is it a recording?""

""I don't know,"" I return. ""I'm gonna keep watching it and see if there's anything I can tell. Do our code words with Buddy.""

We have code words because we're nerds. We've seen too many pod people and impostor movies, so we decided a long time ago to make code words with each other to be able to tell if one of us was an impostor. We have a couple code words, but we also have a three sentence story we recite together, each saying a different part alternately of each other. I hear her on the phone saying the things we taught our son, he giggles as he says them (he does every time we practice) since he thinks they're a joke and doesn't have any idea of the real meaning. We're both convinced he's our son. My wife then says our part and I'm convinced she's her. We made up these words as a complete joke to ourselves. I never once in my life ever imagined we'd actually need them. Unreal.

She got to her parents safely and it was hard to hang up. I told her we'll figure it out in the morning, hopefully just a glitch. She said she didn't think it was a glitch. When she was running out she had to run by our son's room and the door was open. There's a little flashing light on the back of the camera that indicates its connected to the internet. It gives off just enough light that when she ran by she thought she saw, out of the corner of her eye, a shadowy outline of what could have been an adult sitting on our son's bed. It sends chills down my spine to think about.

Knowing they were safe and out of the house is the only thing that kept me at work that night. It was a long four hours but I kept checking the camera every chance I got. Sure enough, they were still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera with emotionless gazes.

I studied them to see if I could see any pattern, from their breathing to their blinking. Their breathing was steady and looked normal, it was their blinking that would tell me if this was just some kind of bizarre, time looped freak accident video or not. I intently stare at my phone and count the seconds between each blink, telling myself if this is a loop then their blinks should be even and occur at the same time each time.

There was no pattern to their blinking, it was erratic and random, just as a person blinking should be. The passing hours are what finally sealed the deal that this was not a weird looped video of some kind. My son's window is visible on camera and I can see on camera that it is getting lighter outside his room. His curtains keep out just enough light to prevent the camera from exiting night vision, but lets in just enough to be able to tell the sun is rising.

I try to figure out what the hell I'm going to do before I leave work. Calling the police comes to mind, but I talk myself out of it. First of all what am I supposed to say? Someone is in my house that looks like my wife but isn't? Worse yet, what if they \*are\* entities of some kind and the police do go over and it kills them or something.

I decide to tell coworker about it. He's a firm believer in the paranormal and might have a suggestion. I show him the video and tell him the story. His initial response of ""that's creepy as fuck"" doesn't help much, but he says he wants to go over and check it out. He says we both should to see if Not-My-Wife will try and act like my wife. I tell him absolutely not and he says we should at least go to the house even if we don't go in. I agree on that since I wanted to close the garage.

We got to my house and walked around the perimeter first. Not sure what we wanted to accomplish by that, but it felt like something we should do. The curtains were all drawn since nobody was there to open them in the morning, so we couldn't see anything. I went to close the garage and suddenly had this overwhelming urge to go inside and investigate, it was like I just had to know what was going on. So in we went.

We walked through the kitchen towards the foyer where the stairs are. It's so quiet in our house right now you could hear a feather drop, forget the pin. We stop at the bottom of the stairs and wait a few seconds. I look at the camera again and they are still sitting there. I've never been so scared in my life. My coworker puts his foot on the first step and I suddenly say ""stop"" loudly.

""Forget this, we're outta here,"" I tell him. ""Come on,"" I start making my way back to the kitchen.

We hear a loud creak in the floor from upstairs. It's my son's room. He has a very loud, creaky board right in the middle of his floor that's almost impossible not to step on. My wife and are still deciding if we ever want to fix it because it will alert us if he's ever up to no good when he gets older trying to sneak out or something.

""Come on, come on, COME ON!"" I yell as I motion for him to move his ass. We're out of the house in about two seconds. Out on the street I check my phone. Now only Not-My-Son was sitting on the bed, same blank stare. Not-My-Wife was gone.

""Holy shit!"" my coworker says,

""That was stupid as fuck of us. Do NOT tell my wife we went inside."" She would be so ungodly mad if she found out what we just did.

I use my garage door opener in my car to close the door. Before we leave I look at the camera again. Not-My-Wife is back on the bed with Not-My-Son, both staring blankly up at the camera, blinking every few seconds.

\*\*\*

That was all about four days ago now. Not-My-Wife and Not-My-Son are still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera. They haven't moved a millimeter. We obviously haven't gone back to our house. What do we do?

nosleep,"My student submitted the most disturbing ""Living History"" project I've ever seen.","One of my least favorite parts about being a middle school history teacher is the bullshit “Living History” assignments we give at the end of every school year. Kids are supposed to sit with their grandparents and video tape, voice record, or transcribe their oldest memories for posterity (and for an easy way to bring up their GPA).

I have been doing this for seventeen years, and when I collected the projects this time around, I assumed they would be as dull, if not duller than usual. This had not been a particularly bright class.

So I went home, poured myself a glass of wine, and prepared for a long night of “I only owned two pairs of pants when I was your age” and “My brother got beat with a newspaper for hitting a baseball into a neighbor’s yard.” And of course, these projects were peppered with innocent, old-person comments that were so horribly sexist and racist you just had to laugh. 

Now, I had a girl in my class whom I will call Olivia. She was pudgy, quiet, and proved herself a consistent B student. I expected her project to be as unremarkable as her, and perhaps that’s why I was so profoundly disturbed by what I witnessed that night.

Olivia had submitted two discs for some reason, so I began with the one marked “interview.” My screen hiccupped twice before a grainy image of a living room came into view. The place was a hoarder’s hell. Olivia was curled up in an armchair clutching a notebook and looking like a scared animal. Across from her sat a man with a somber countenance, smoking a cigarette and staring at her expectantly.

“Go ahead,” a woman’s voice whispered from behind the camera. Olivia’s owlish eyes flashed towards the screen, then back to the man.

“I am here with my Great Uncle Stephen,” she began almost inaudibly. “He is going to tell us about his oldest memories from being in the army.”

Great Uncle Stephen looked like he’d rather be in a goddamn trench at the moment, but he waited patiently for the questions to begin.

Not surprisingly, Olivia read verbatim from the suggested questions sheet I had handed out to the students. He answered her curtly. Once or twice I heard her mother whisper “speak up, Olivia” from behind the camera. Typical, boring shit.

So I was intrigued when Olivia set down the notebook and asked, “Did you like being in the army?” 

That was totally off-script. Great Uncle Stephen emitted a chain smoker’s wheeze. “Nope. Glad to get out of my town though.”

“Where did you go?”

“Balkans.”

“Uh-huh,” she said. I doubted she knew what the Balkans were, and my suspicion was confirmed when she asked, “Was Baukiss very different from here?”

“Yes.”

Mom cleared her throat from behind the camera, perhaps encouraging Great Uncle Stephen to be a little more forthcoming.

But Olivia seemed genuinely interested. “Uncle Stephen,” she asked, “what is your very worst memory from the army?”

The old man crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and then slowly lifted himself out of his chair. “I’ll be back,” he mumbled. The camera cut off.

When the screen flashed back on, everything was the same except Great Uncle Stephen had several pieces of paper in plastic sleeves laid atop all the crap sitting on his coffee table. One, he held in his hand.

“I was a kid when I enlisted,” he said, looking at Olivia. “Your brother’s age,” he told her. Olivia nodded. “I never saw combat. Both of my deployments were to cities in Eastern Europe that had been destroyed by civil wars. Everything was a mess. I felt like a janitor for fuck’s sa-” 

“Ahem!” Mom coughed.

Great Uncle Stephen sighed and looked at his paper. “My unit was assigned to a school that had been obliterated by all the violence. Broken windows, caved in rooms – and for some reason, the part that got to me the most was that the school had been like this for years before we got there. No one had lifted a finger to fix it. I saw kids walk by it on their way to go beg for money or whatever shit they did-”

The camera dipped towards the floor as I heard Mom whisper harshly at Great Uncle Stephen. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but it wasn’t hard to imagine.

“Do you want to hear this goddamn story or not?” I heard him bark in response. “Then you better let me tell it how I want.”

“Mom,” Olivia chimed. “Please stop interrupting.”

“Are you presenting this in front of the class?”

“No, Mom, we’re just handing it in to the teacher.”

“I’m sure he’s heard the word shit before,” Great Uncle Stephen contributed helpfully. I wasn’t a “he” as a matter of fact, but other than that the statement was accurate.

The camera was lifted and after a couple of blurry focus adjustments, the shot was the same as before.

“Ahh I’m talking too much anyway,” he grumbled. He lifted the piece of paper in his hand close to his face. “In the basement, I found this letter. I didn’t know what it said but I had a buddy of mine translate it. So I’m gonna read it now. And then I’ll tell you what I saw in that basement.”

A chill ran down my spine. Mom zoomed in to Great Uncle Stephen and his letter. His palsied hands trembled as he held up the paper. This is what he read:




Dear Sir,

I never loved my country. So many of these skirmishes are born from patriotism, a power struggle for the shards of a once-great empire, but I do not care what name my home has on a map. This fighting is senseless and I stay as far away from it as I can.

It was not these attacks and disorganized violence that took the lives of my wife and child. It was illness. Mercifully, it happened quickly for the baby. Nadja suffered for longer. I watched in horror knowing I could do nothing for them. My only solace is that I was there for them every step of the way. I stopped going to work one day, and no one came after me. I doubt they noticed I was gone. Since the school was simply across a field, visible from my window, it would have been easy to go for a few hours each day and come home quickly to care for them. But what was the point? All I did was clean floors. I was as useless to the world as I was to my family.

I tried to take Nadja to the hospital, but the journey was too long and taxing. I brought her home and she died that night.

After Nadja and the baby were gone… well, I don’t remember much. I didn’t leave my hovel, barely ate and slept, thought many times of taking my own life. Tempting though it was, I felt paralyzed by my own helplessness.

The one thing that kept me sane was my radio. I never turned it off once. Even though I didn’t listen to the words being said – in fact, the channel I got the clearest was in English (I think) which I don’t speak a lick of. But the voices, the music, and the true knowledge that life existed beyond this violent city sustained me.

I have no idea how long passed before I saw the light of day again. I was dizzy from hunger, so finding food was my priority. My radio came with me, of course. Since I first holed myself up, it has gone everywhere with me. It talks to me as I sleep and as I wake. I don’t know what it’s saying, but I know I would die without it.

Once I had some water and food, it occurred to me that the only thing left to do was go back to work. So I did. The following morning, I simply returned to the school where I was a janitor and got back to work. 

Nobody made a big deal out of it. Like I said, Nadja had been sick for a long time, and those who worked at the school knew it. I appreciate that no one had pestered me to come back to work during the hardest days of my life. The teachers never said much to me, but we smiled at each other in the halls and that mutual respect was perhaps the reason I decided to come back at all.

The place had gone to the dogs without me, so I simply grabbed my broom and rags from my closet and set to cleaning. Everyone is grateful to have me back, I know. And the best part is that nobody minds my radio. I bring it with me everywhere and keep the volume low enough not to disrupt the students. No one has ever complained. In fact, I suspect they like it.

The schoolhouse is not very big, but does require a lot of maintenance. The floors are always sticky and stained, so I spend most of my time mopping. Kids make messes – I guess that’s why I’m still in business. Sometimes I have to move things around to make sure I get every spot on the floor beautiful and clean, but I take pride in that.

And the repairs! The school always needs tune-ups here and there, and I am happy to help. Some days I’m reconstructing a desk that broke as I whistle along with the radio, other times I handle more serious, structural issues. Days when I have work like this, I feel truly instrumental, like a cog in a larger machine. How could this school survive without me? It took me a long time, but I once again feel that I have purpose.

There is a larder behind the school that is full of preserved food. In lieu of payment, I am allowed to take as much food as I need. That arrangement is fine – what would I do with money anyway? I used to bring the food back to my home, just one field away from the school, but when I started sleeping in the basement no one seemed to notice. This school is special to me and I cannot leave it unguarded.

When I am besieged with memories of my wife and baby, I turn up the volume on the radio to drown out such thoughts. It works for me every time.

Except this morning.

Because this morning, I woke up to dead silence.

I frantically examined the radio to see what had happened. I honestly cannot tell you how many days in a row I have been using it. Did it simply live out its life and die naturally? I have spent the entire day trying to fix it. Most of this time, I have been crying. I am losing my mind without it.

I have given myself until sundown. If I cannot fix it by then, I am going to take my life. I am writing this because the sunlight is starting to die and I know what my fate shall be.

I have thought about taking one last walk through the halls of my school, saying goodbye to the students and teachers. I know I will be missed. But I cannot bring myself to leave this room. I cannot go anywhere knowing that my radio is dead in here.

There are no more tears in me. It feels now like I can’t catch my breath. I vomited what little food I had in my stomach and I am growing dizzy again, like I did after Nadja died. I am not long for this world.

But before I take my life, I have closed the door to this room and stuck a chair beneath the handle. It is the only room in the basement and has a small casement that lets in just enough light for me to see what I am doing. If anyone is kind enough to come looking for me, they should not be met with this gruesome sight. Perhaps they will see the door is blocked, smell my rotting body, and simply forget I ever existed.

But I have placed both my radio and this note outside the door. Kind sir, if you are reading this, I have one humble request: please fix it. Save my radio. It did not deserve to die in its sleep and I am ashamed that I cannot revive it.

Now I am ready to join Nadja and little Ludmilla in heaven. I hope this school can find another janitor who loves and cares for it the way I do.

The hour is now. Do not forget my radio.

Stanislav




When Mom zoomed back out, Olivia had tears in her eyes. “Thank you for sharing, Uncle Stephen,” Mom said, her voice choked. “I think we have enough.”

“Wait!” Olivia chirped. “He said there’s more. What did you find?”

Before Great Uncle Stephen could open his mouth, the image disappeared. My jaw dropped. Was that it? What did Great Uncle Stephen see?

I promptly remembered that there was a second disc. This one was unmarked, but I hoped it contained the rest of the interview.

There was no video, only audio. The voice that started up was Olivia’s.

“Hi Miss Gerrity. I’m sorry about my mom, but she refused to record the rest of what my uncle was saying. But I asked him to continue and secretly recorded the story as a voice memo on my phone. I remember you said earlier this year that history is written by the people who win wars.” She sucked in a breath and commenced crying. “But everyone’s history is important, even if they are sad, pathetic people and even if they never won a single thing in their life. I haven’t slept through the night since I finished this project, but you have to hear what my uncle has to say.”

There were tears in my eyes, too. The sincerity of her words was beautiful. I was also flattered that she had remembered some trite phrase I threw around because it was what my history teachers said to me. 

Before I got too sappy over it, the audio began again.

“Fine,” came Mom’s frustrated voice. “If you want to hear the rest of the story, fine, but this is not appropriate for a school project.”

“Let me finish,” Great Uncle Stephen snapped. “If it’s too much for you, help yourself to a snack in the kitchen. But Olivia wants to know what happened.”

I heard her mother mumble something and walk away. Olivia and her uncle were alone. I imagined her looking at him expectantly. 

“So did you find the radio? Or did it get ruined when the school got blown up?”

He rasped and I heard the distinct click of a lighter. “That letter,” he began slowly, “had a date on it.”

“What date?” she inquired hungrily.

“It was dated two weeks before we started rebuilding the school.”

“Didn’t you say the school had been destroyed like two years ago?”

“Yes,” replied Great Uncle Stephen. “It had been.”

There was silence as I felt goosebumps on my arms. The images that came to my mind were almost too overwhelming to express, but Great Uncle Stephen put them into words effortlessly. Clearly he had spent his whole life thinking about it.

“This man, this Stanislav, went to a vandalized, falling apart schoolhouse and cleaned up blood and rubble like it was spilled drinks and dust. He smiled at dead bodies in the hallway and believed they were smiling back at him because they liked his radio. He moved around corpses so he could sweep the ground under them. The roof was half collapsed, so when it rained, he must’ve gotten soaking wet but was so oblivious that he didn’t even feel a thing.” I could hear Olivia crying steadily. “I found the larder he was talking about. It was all pickled, preserved food that probably tasted like shit. Most of the stuff was moldy.”

“Did – did you see the dead body?”

“Yes. Hanging from the ceiling, but still amazingly… lifelike. He wasn’t rotting away.  This hadn’t happened years ago.”

“Did he look peaceful?” she asked, a chord of desperation in her voice.

“Couldn’t tell you. The smell was rank, and his face was blue and his eyes were bulging. Like this.” I imagined him demonstrating. 

“And the radio?” Olivia wept.

I heard Great Uncle Stephen take a long drag of his cigarette. “It was there, alright. And it was still on.”

nosleep,How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?,"So I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year, and last month, we moved in together. Maybe that's kind of fast. I don't know. My parents sure thought it was. But honestly, everything was great in the beginning. We get along really well, and we've never had more than a brief argument. 

&#x200B;

But then she started whistling.

&#x200B;

It's so dumb, I know, but she's always whistling this weird song, and it really gets on my nerves. My mom kept telling me that once you move in with someone, you discover all of the quirks they'd been hiding from you, and it's not like I didn't expect that to be true. But for some reason, this is just an ongoing issue with us, and I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

At first I would just hear her whistling it when she was showering. It was kind of cute, like her own little bathroom theme song. I didn't recognize the melody, but it was very distinct. I could mimic it from memory if I wanted to. In fact, sometimes it gets stuck in my head, and it drives me a little crazy. You know the type.

&#x200B;

After a week or so, I asked her what the song was, and she just laughed. I'm wondering if maybe she came up with it on her own, something that she does absently, especially once she started doing it more. Like I'd be reading a book, and she'd be on the computer, and she'd just start whistling. And I tried to ignore it. I seriously feel like a dick for being so grumpy about it, and I know she wasn't doing it to annoy me. But she'd just go on and on, and it would pull my attention away from whatever I was doing.

&#x200B;

So, I finally said something a few nights ago. I was going over some legal documents for work, and she just starts whistling like crazy, on and on. And I'm trying to just block it out, but it's seriously excessive. Like, I know you guys are probably thinking that I was overreacting, but it felt like she was whistling right into my ear, and it just frayed my last bit of patience.

&#x200B;

As calmly and nicely as I could, I called out to her and asked her to quiet down. She didn't reply. I asked her again, and she still didn't answer, so I left the bedroom and found her in the living room, watching a movie. She wasn't whistling anymore, and for some reason, that really irked me. It felt like she was messing with me. And she just looked over at me, like she didn't know what my deal was.

&#x200B;

I asked her if she could stop whistling so much, and she told me she wasn't whistling. Now, I get that maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it, but no one whistles *that* much and doesn't notice. It's not really like her to mess with me like that, and I don't know what she's trying to get out of this. I thought maybe she was teasing or playing a joke, but she had to see how annoyed I was. I asked her again to just not whistle so loudly, and she didn't answer. There was tension in the room, and it felt like our first fight since moving in together. Even though she didn't whistle for the rest of the night, I couldn't focus on my work anyway because I was upset about the confrontation.

&#x200B;

Then, of course, the next night she was whistling again. I hear her when she comes home from work, and she keeps going for at least an hour. I didn't want to have another fight, so I just hung out in the bedroom and listened to her move around for a while. I felt like I was blowing things out of proportion, but honestly, how hard is it to just not whistle all the time? It was no big deal when it was now and then, but I feel like she whistles more than she even talks to me now. So I'm sitting up in the room, thinking about that, and that's probably why I was worked up when I finally came down.

&#x200B;

She was cooking dinner, which is sweet, but she was still whistling. So I said, softly, ""Hey honey, maybe we should put on some music instead, so you don't have to fill the silence with whistling."" I tried to play it off like a joke, but I knew she'd probably see through it and get annoyed again. She didn't even turn to face me, just huffed and kept cooking.

&#x200B;

After a minute, I told her I was sorry about the other night, but the whistling just sort of strikes my ear wrong, and if she could try not to whistle so much and so loudly, it would make my life a lot easier. I feel like I was being fair. I know it seems controlling and nit picky, but it was bothering me a lot. We all have our things, you know? I try not to chew loudly at the table because it bothers her, so why can't she just stop whistling sometimes for me?

&#x200B;

But she totally freaked out. She turned around and told me she wasn't whistling and she didn't know what my problem was. At this point, I don't get why she was doing this. It obviously wasn't funny for either of us, and she seemed genuinely upset, so I don't know why she kept provoking me. I asked her what her deal was, why she was so defensive about the stupid whistling, and she told me to shut up. She told me she was sick of talking about it, like *I* was the one being unreasonable.

&#x200B;

I never get mad at her, but I just snapped. I told her to stop whistling before I lost my mind. She called me crazy, just because I was getting a little upset, and somehow, that was all I could take. I grabbed one of the cast iron pans from the stove and swung it at her head as hard as I could.

&#x200B;

She fell over and smashed her head on the counter, but I swung the pan again before she hit the ground. I think I hit her maybe three or four times. I don't remember, but I feel horrible. There was blood everywhere, and her jaw might be broken. No, I think it is for sure. I couldn't believe I'd lost my temper like that, and I have no idea how we can move past this. I feel so ashamed for letting things get physical, regardless of how much she might have been provoking me.

&#x200B;

But here's the kicker. She's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. And I asked her nicely to please stop, but now she won't even pause! For two days she's just been lying on the kitchen floor with her eyes rolled back and her mouth hanging open, just marinating in congealed blood, and she's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, but this is just too much. I just need her to shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. JUST SHUT UP.",Entertainment
nosleep,A Package Marked “Return to sender”,"My neighbor is one of those annoying wannabe YouTube personalities. Over the years, I’ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming *epic win*, *epic fail*, or, fuck, *epic maintenance of the status quo*, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can’t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn’t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life.

Things were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written “Return to Sender”.

I’m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I’d leave his package in my garage. It wasn’t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you’ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don’t have to.

It was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside.

“Shit,” I cursed.

I hoped I hadn’t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn’t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route.

Hands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is.

I’m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that’s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That’s when I opened the garage door, and that’s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose.

The culprit wasn’t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow?

I covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn’t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn’t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn’t looking forward to.

My scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn’t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don’t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I’m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I’d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow.

Nothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet.

I returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things.

I wouldn’t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn’t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead.

I called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It’s kind of hard *not* to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn’t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor’s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera.

They showed me the footage only once. I’m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn’t hurt. Either way, I saw it.

My neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He’d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend – a guy I’d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts –, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours…or days, I’m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. ‘I think I’m in a truck now, I can feel it moving’, ‘Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!’, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died.

There’s one thing I didn’t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of *my* garage door.

nosleep,Maria on the Moon,"“Did you know that early astronomers thought there were oceans on the moon?” I asked, looking up from my book.

My mom shifted in her bed, a tangle of IV tubes shifting with her. “Of course. The moon seems like the perfect place to find an ocean.”

“What a shame we never found water then,” I said. “Because those false seas, astronomers called them ‘maria.’”

Mom smiled. “How sweet of them to name the moon oceans after me.”

“Well, they didn’t find any oceans,” I reminded her.

“Maybe they just didn’t look hard enough,” she replied, a little laugh slipping from her lips.

For all of the pain she was in, all of the fear she must feel, my mother always had the kind of laugh that could light a candle. We were in her hospital room, the same one we’d been in and out of for the last year and a half. Sometimes we had a roommate, sometimes we were alone. Always she held steady enough for both of us, the rock I tied my hope to, the wall against the grief I knew was coming.

Cancer is such a mundane word for something so hungry and cruel. I’ve noticed medicine does that a lot, covers horror with tedious language like a bed sheet over a body.

*Malignant. Inoperable. Metastasized. Terminal.*

But when she laughed...when she laughed we weren’t in the hospital anymore, we were home. When she laughed, she wasn’t sick, she was young again, and I was a kid, and the world was a bright place begging to be explored. What a miracle my mother was. Cancer had taken so much from her, aged and hurt her, but it could never steal her laugh. That was hers to keep.

“How are we feeling today?” the doctor asked. He came in less and less often. We could all sense this was the final stay in this room.

“Just brilliant, doc,” my mom said, struggling to sit a little higher. “We can still go dancing later if you’d like. Though we’ll have to ask for my son’s blessing. Ever since his dad died, Brian’s been very protective of me.”

I put on a stern face. “I’ll need to know your intentions are pure, Dr. Bradshaw.”

“As the driven snow,” he played along. “But I might need a raincheck on the dance, Ms. Willen. I’m not as young as I used to be.”

He emphasized his age, running his fingers through grey-white hair. My mom tapped her bare scalp.

“Right there with you, tiger,” she said.

Dr. Bradshaw smiled but I could tell he was burdened. I saw him glance at the small idol I’d placed on my mother’s nightstand. The talisman was a miniature oak tree carved from gray soapstone. There were four faces etched into the tree, a sentry against ill health and bitter spirits. I could tell the stone tree made the doctor uncomfortable. In all honesty, I had a tough time looking at the idol for more than a few seconds. The faces were each whittled in vivid expression. The face closest to my mother’s bed was smiling kindly and the face pointed towards the door was snarling, meant to ward away harm.

The final two faces were both weeping. All four shapes were too human, too raw. There was a *weirdness* to the stone tree that put people on edge but I’d grown used to every shade of weird you can imagine. My mother’s side of the family was full of stories of unexplained luck and mysterious tragedy, whispered secrets and unexplained deaths. By all accounts, my maternal grandmother was either an honest-to-goodness witch or full-bore, high-caliber crazy, or both. *Probably* both.

The stone tree was from a box of my grandmother’s things I’d found in the attic earlier that month. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but my mom did seem to get a bit better when I’d brought in the talisman, at least for a little while.

I was daydreaming about family history and the odd box while Dr. Bradshaw checked his charts and mom’s vitals.

“Can I talk to you for a moment?” he asked, ripping me back to reality. Dr. Bradshaw tried to keep a light tone but I could tell he didn’t have good news.

The hospital hallway smelled like ammonia and birthday cake. Someone must have had a party, maybe a patient, maybe a nurse. Strange how you remember the insignificant details while your world is crashing down around you.

“I’m so sorry,” Dr. Bradshaw told me. “The results came in this morning. It’s spreading aggressively. We...we held it back as long as we could, Brian. Your mom is a fighter. But right now we just need to, well, to try to keep her as comfortable as we can. Brian?”

The wall was cracking, grief waiting on the other side, heavy and cold as an empty house. I’d known for months that this was the most likely outcome but it still hurt to hear. Hurt worse than I could stomach.

“There’s nothing left to try?” I asked, fighting down the urge to throw up. “Anything, experimental, untested, anything?”

Dr. Bradshaw shook his head. “I’m sorry. Sometimes we just run out of options. She fought a good fight.”

“How long does she have left?” I asked, looking back into her room. She’d fallen asleep.

“Not long. Maybe days. Have you considered hospice?”

The smell of ammonia and birthday cake. The steady beep of mom’s heart monitor. I tried to focus on the world around me. My hope wasn’t dead yet. If medicine couldn’t help my mom, maybe something older could. I thought of the box of my grandmother’s things waiting in the attic. There was a lot in there I hadn’t gone through yet, books and candles and secrets and lost things. Maybe there was a cure or at least a way to keep the fight going.

“No,” I said. “If all that’s left is to make her comfortable, I want to take her home.”

The doctor smiled. “I understand. We can give you some medication, ways to help her with the pain.” He put his hand on my shoulder. “Your mom’s been in a lot of pain but she’ll have peace, soon. You’ve done all you can.”

“I know,” I lied. “Thank you.”

Mom lived in a small ranch house ten miles outside of town. There wasn’t much in the way of neighbors besides some woods and a creek slithering through her yard. It was a windy, warm March afternoon when I took my dying mother home. That night I began my work. I was going to turn the house into a bunker, a maze Death could never solve. I would keep my mother safe, I would find a way to keep her alive.

The little red book was full of ideas. Running water was an obvious place to start. The creek behind the house was barely a trickle but it should provide some coverage to the south side of the property. Salt was next, lining the doorways and window frames, then in an unbroken circle around the entire house. This step was to be repeated daily, the red book stressed, or even multiple times per day. Even a moderate breeze played holy havoc with any salt poured outside so it was always best to trace and retrace every few hours. Water and salt were common defenses against man’s oldest enemy and well known. The book offered other, less conventional, advice.

It took me nearly a week to finish carving the symbols and signs into the walls, the floors, even the trees on the property. Sometime around noon on the third day, on my back in the crawlspace etching strange marks onto the underside of the floor, it struck me how ridiculous I was acting. There was no proof that any of the information in the little red book was anything other than the delusional ramblings of a bizarre woman I’d only met once or twice as a child. For all I knew, the runes meant to ward off Death were actually a grocery list written in Cantonese. But I was desperate, and every time I saw my mother she looked frailer, more fragile. So I continued carving and praying and building layers upon layers of protections to keep Death far away.

Making my marks took me all over the property. It was a big yard, nearly three acres that blended gradually into the surrounding forest. I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact boundary where cultivated met nature, the edges simply bled together, but I did my best to create a clean border with lines between the symbols. I’d always loved the wildness here, the way you could wander a few hundred yards away from home and feel like you’d traveled hundreds of years into the past to somewhere primal. This was the perfect playground for a kid, whether I was out exploring trails or trapping minnows or spending the summer building yet another treehouse, convinced this would be the final one. It never was, I was never satisfied.

The house itself, though small, was more than enough room for my mother and me. Dad died when I was seven. I don’t remember much about him, just how big he seemed, with a bonfire grin and arms that I thought could hold the whole world. My mom often said I took after my father. I could see it in the old pictures of him, we had the same eyes, green as moss in the summer, and the same fiery shock of red hair, enemy to every comb on the planet. The sicker mom got the more often she called me by my father’s name. I worried when she drifted away like that but a part of me was proud she’d mistake me for him.

After all of the symbols were carved there were a few steps left in the book to deter Death from visiting. There were dozens of charms and talismans in the bottom of the old box in the attic. I sat up there combing through everything my grandmother left behind, referencing the red book, pushing the tiny charms into tidy piles. None of the idols were larger than my thumb. Some were iron and others were wood, some were heavy, others light. All of them were uncomfortable to look at or touch.

The attic was drafty but not nearly enough to explain the cold that burrowed into me as I sorted the charms. I’m not particularly tall but the attic felt like it was designed for dolls, beams so low I couldn’t even walk bent over. I moved around on my knees, rough floorboards threatening splinters even through my jeans. I could have taken the box downstairs where I’d have more room but the idea filled me with a deep unease. It seemed better to leave the box up in the attic, only taking down objects as I needed them. Up here, at least, my grandmother’s items, her legacy was...quarantined.

The red book was very specific about the distribution of the totems around the house and property. I walked carefully through my mom’s backyard, boots plopping in and out of mud, compass in hand. It had rained nearly every day since I’d taken my mom home from the hospital. I knew it was almost certainly a coincidence but couldn’t help wonder if the soft curtains of rain falling to the ground were for her. I placed charms in a compass rose with the house in the middle. The most disturbing objects were given places of honor at each cardinal direction.

Water, salt, wards, charms, all placed carefully, intentionally. My grandmother’s book promised that these would offer some degree of protection against the inevitability of Death. The symbols would confuse it, the talismans distract it, and the water and salt make barriers to slow it down. But Death might still find a crack to slip through, so the red book recommended one final trick.

There was a small candle in the bottom of the box, dirty white as stained paper. When I took the candle from its case the smell made me gag. Have you ever walked past a portable toilet in the dog days of summer? When it’s so hot, the blue plastic has started to warp and bubble? Imagine that smell distilled into a finger’s worth of wax. I brought the candle downstairs, placed it on the dining room table and set it alight.

The wick caught immediately, the flame burning an unusual red-brown. No heat came off of the candle and it actually seemed cooler the closer I moved my hand to the fire. Once the wax began to melt the smell was ten times worse than it was back in the attic. I choked down a greasy sickness crawling up my throat and quickly left the room, shutting the French doors as I went. That helped trap the odor but I couldn’t shake the sense of nausea. I went to check on my mother.

“Do you remember the day you ran away?” my mom asked, sitting in her bed, lunch untouched on the nightstand beside her.

I didn’t think she had any weight left to lose before she was nothing but bone and memory. Her skin was rice paper over a frame that seemed smaller every day. Her eyes, though, no matter how fragile the rest of her became, remained two little lanterns against the dark, blue and bright and alive.

“I didn’t make it very far,” I answered. “And I wasn’t really running away, only...stretching my legs.”

Mom smiled. “You told me you were leaving for the circus. You wanted to be either a lion tamer or a strongman or maybe a fire-eater.”

“I think I wanted to be all of that combined. Young me was big on multitasking.”

My mother turned so she was looking out the window into the yard. “I was so scared when I found your note, the one saying you were leaving. My hands were shaking like you wouldn’t believe when I called the sheriff and then Mr. Jonas down the way. It felt like we were searching for you for half the night, even though it couldn’t have been more than an hour before we found you there, lost in the woods, wandering around and shivering. You hadn’t even brought a jacket.”

I sat next to my mom on the bed. “Yeah, I didn’t exactly plan ahead for my circus escape. I remember...I remember getting over the idea real quick but I couldn’t find my way back. I’m glad you found me.”

“I’m glad, too,” my mother said and I noticed her wipe away a tear. “I’m so glad. That hour you were gone, Brian, that was the most afraid I’ve ever been. Afraid we wouldn’t find you, afraid you might be hurt or worse. I couldn’t hardly breathe through the fear. Then, suddenly, you were there and the relief nearly knocked me over. I think we stayed up together the rest of the night watching the stars. I wanted to make sure you could find the North Star in case you ever got lost again.”

She turned back to me, reached out her thin hand and placed it over mine. There were still tears in her eyes but she smiled her lighthouse smile and, for a moment, I saw her just as she used to be, just as she was the night I ran away and my mom found me.

I squeezed her hand. “I was scared, too. I was afraid I’d be stuck out there. What made you think of it?”

“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about dying lately and-”

“Don’t,” I interrupted. “Don’t talk like that. You’re not going anywhere, not for a long time.”

“It’s okay,” she said, squeezing my hand back. “It’s okay. I’ve known real fear and what I’m feeling now...it’s not like that. I’m scared, I guess, but I’m at peace with it. I had such a beautiful life. I’m so glad I got to meet you, to be your mom.”

“I’m glad, too,” I whispered, voice breaking on the last word.

*But I won’t let you go without a fight,* I added silently in my mind.

Something was trying to get to my mom. The strangeness began the day after I lit the candle. At first it was small blips, tiny *wrongs* that I chalked up to my imagination. Doors I knew I’d closed at night were open in the morning. Food began to rot and spoil within days of me bringing it into the house. Eventually, food would go bad almost immediately. Every few hours the television in the living room would either turn off if it was running, or on if it was off.

Clocks would stop overnight, always at 3:03 am. Shadows began *sticking* to the corners of rooms independent of any light sources. The shadows were stubborn and they would linger for as long as I would stare, then disappear when I blinked. I began hearing bumps and knocks at all hours and sometimes, when I’d enter an empty room, I had a sharp, fleeting certainty that it was only just occupied.

I avoided the dining room except to check in twice a day to see if the candle was still burning. The smell was vicious and would claw its way into your throat and nostrils the moment it was given a chance. I kept the door to the room shut and kept air fresheners running in the surrounding rooms 24/7. The funny thing was, the candle never went out, never even seemed to shrink. I could see the wax melting but day-in and day-out the candle refused to change.

Days marched into weeks and the wrongness only grew deeper. My mom and I both lost sleep to vivid nightmares that we couldn’t remember when we woke up. Only the echoes remained but those were enough to leave my pulse sprinting until morning. I started sleeping in a chair in my mother’s room. I did this to comfort her if she woke up confused during the night but also because, if I’m being honest, I was too scared to sleep alone. I felt like a child running into his parents’ room, convinced there was a monster under the bed. Thing is...maybe there was.

By the third week I couldn’t keep doors closed. They would slam open the moment I left the room. A terrible scratching began inside of the walls. I told my mom it might be squirrels or mice but the sound was so insistent, not like rodents milling about, more like a dog wanting in. I stopped leaving the house for supplies; instead, I had what little food we ate delivered. I kept the curtains drawn. There was tapping on the glass every night.

About a month after leaving the hospital we were living like zombies. The dining room couldn’t contain the smell of the candle anymore. The entire house was clogged with the scent. Tiny noises had graduated into full-on laughs and screams and whispers in the rooms around us. Something kicked the bathroom door so hard while I was taking a shower that the hinges warped. I covered every mirror in the house. I’d started to see things in the corners looking back at me, half-hidden faces, shapes that skittered away as soon as I turned around. Mom was drifting further and further away. She had long moments of confusion where she’d forget my name, forget where we were. Sometimes, she’d think I was my dad. Other times, she’d just stare at the wall for hours, growing fainter and fainter each day like a Polaroid left in the sun.

But she was alive.

It was clear that we were under siege by something. My world shrank to only one room and every trip to the bathroom or to answer the door for food felt like going over the trenches. The noises kept getting worse and worse, the shadows closer, the sense of movement around the house sharper. Every now and then I would feel hot breath on the back of my neck or walk through a cold patch hanging in the air. I stopped bothering redrawing the lines of salt around the house. I knew, deep in my bones, that as long as the sickly candle burned, Death could not take my mom away.

On the thirty-third day after leaving the hospital, I woke with a start from a nightmare, only to find my mom’s bed empty. She hadn’t been able to walk the past week at all, so my first feeling was hope that she might be improving, at least a little. Then I noticed the odor we’d been living with for weeks was gone.

“Mom!” I shouted, running in bare feet out of the room.

I found her in the dining room, the door wide open. She was standing at the table, frail as a neglected scarecrow, bobbing back and forth. Her hands were hovering over the candle. The flame was out.

“Why did you do that?” I whispered. “Mom? Mom...are you okay?”

I padded into the room, the wooden floor freezing cold. My mother didn’t react to my presence, she just continued rocking side-to-side. I realized she was still asleep.

“Mom?” I gently shook her shoulder. “Wake up.”

Her head snapped back and she nearly fell. I caught her on the way down. It felt like she weighed nothing at all.

“What’s going on?” she asked, looking around the dark room. “Where…”

“You’re okay,” I told her. “You were sleepwalking.”

“I was having the most unusual dream,” mom mumbled. “There were so many stars and...”

She began to shiver uncontrollably. The cold hit me a moment later. I let out a gasp. The house was chilly before but the dining room was near-arctic. My breath bloomed into a thin cloud in front of my face. I became acutely aware of the complete silence filling the house.

Then I heard scratching. It was coming all throughout the house, deep tearing sounds at the walls around the dining room. Footsteps came immediately after, heavy and fast. Somewhere in the house a window shattered.

“Brian,” my mother said, holding onto me.

“Don’t worry,” I said, “everything will be-”

My voice deserted me as a massive shadow unfolded in the corner of the room. It was shaped like a man but tall, so very tall. And it was fast. Before I could yell the shadow was on us, pouring over my mother. In the space of a heartbeat, she was simply gone.

“No,” I whispered, clawing at the dissolving shadow where my mom used to be. “No, no, no, no, NO.”

The shadow was disappearing like a puddle sinking into the floor. There was a texture to it, oily and too slick to hold.

I thought of my mother the night she found me lost in the woods, the night I’d run away. Her face filled my memory, her lighthouse smile. I remembered the relief I felt when she found me, the overwhelming love. I held onto that feeling, clutching it close.

“You can’t have her,” I whispered.

I closed my fist around the last threads of the shadow. There was a terrible sensation of *pulling*. It was like I’d caught a horse by the tail and it was trying to shake me. But I held on.

A sense of ripping and being dragged. It was a riptide with a mind of its own. But I held on. It could not shake me.

The temperature was dropping every second and I felt my vision growing dark. The last thought that ran through my head before I blacked out was a promise to myself that even if I died, my grip would hold. I wouldn’t let my mother’s life slip away. All sounds and light faded, narrowing to a pinprick and then going black.

I woke up under a field of stars. I was lying in soft grass, still wearing my pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt. It was cool, wherever I was, but comfortably so. I stood up. There were trees all around me, tall and close, stitched together with shadows. Immediately to my right, there was a road that ran straight as far as I could see, blurring into the horizon. But the stars, they were like nothing I’d ever seen before.

Bright ribbons of northern lights rippled above me in green and blue and purple. Stars lit the sky like millions of lanterns floating on a still ocean. The moon shone sharpest of all, a spotlight hanging above the treeline, so close I thought I could stretch up and brush its face.

“***You are*** ***persistent***,” said a voice from the forest behind me.

I whipped around but couldn’t see anyone. Then a dark spot began to clarify against the gloom. The silhouette separated itself and moved towards me. I recognized it instantly as the shadow from the dining room. As it moved closer, the thing grew and grew until it touched the sky and filled my vision. A deep dread sank into me but I stood my ground.

“Give me back my mom,” I shouted.

The silhouette pulled away from the sky and then it was standing in front of me, the shape and size of a tall man. But instead of a shadow, the thing had wrapped itself in stars. Miniature constellations drifted across its body, floating slowly like a timelapse of a clear night sky. Burning brightest was the North Star, blue and warm. The space between the stars was absolute black, not a shadow but a complete absence of light. It was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I’d ever seen.

“What are you?” I whispered.

***“You know,”*** it replied.

“Give her back,” I begged. “Please, give her back.”

***“I can’t. It’s her time. Past her time. You delayed me. Delayed her.”***

I clenched my fists. “She didn’t get enough time. *I* didn’t get enough time. It’s not right, it’s not fair.”

***“Of course it’s not fair,”*** the starry thing said, ***“but it is right. You each have your time, and at the end of it, there’s me, and there is a road, and we walk it together.”***

“Where to?” I asked. “Where are you taking her?”

***“I don’t know. It’s not for me to know, only to know how to get there.”***

“Then I won’t let you take her.” I planted myself in the road. The world was still and solemn around us. The constellations drifted like clouds and a soft breeze stirred the branches.

The starry thing didn’t respond for a moment.

***“Your mother was kind and caring. Wherever she goes, she’ll have peace,”*** it promised.

“But-”

The creature raised its hand. ***“Did you ever stop to think that death isn’t an enemy? Death simply*** **is.** ***It is the natural partner to life. It knows no prejudice or malice, has no designs or ambitions. Your mother spent so long suffering, felt so much pain. Instead of letting her rest, you took it upon yourself to draw her life beyond its given course. You kept her alive but at the cost of stretching her thin, prolonging her sickness, diluting her. Did you keep her alive for her benefit or for yours?”***

I couldn’t answer.

***“Stretching a life is unnatural, dangerous,”*** it told me. ***“In the weeks you kept me away you drew the attention of old things, hungry things, forces that would like nothing better than to swallow even the memory of your mother, to tear and bite until there was nothing left but pain and fear and a perfect emptiness.”***

I shuddered remembering the clawing sounds, the shattered window, and the laughter from empty rooms.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered. “Are they...can they hurt her here? Is she safe?”

The stars in the shadow burned brighter for a moment. ***“Your mother won’t walk her road alone. None of you do. I walk with you, always, to the end.”***

“Can I see her?” I asked. “Please? Just, I...let me say goodbye.”

It considered for several seconds. ***“You are persistent.”***

And then the starry thing was gone. I was standing alone on an empty road.

“Brian?”

I turned to find my mother behind me on the road. She looked younger, healthier than I’d seen her in years. The frailty was gone and my mother seemed exactly as I remembered her when she found me in the woods all those years ago.

“Isn’t this the most beautiful dream?” she asked, staring up at the night sky.

“Yeah,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “A beautiful dream. I love you, mom. I love you so much, so very much.”

She smiled and touched my cheek. “I love you, too. Don’t cry, it’s okay. I’ll wake up any time now. I’ll see you then.”

I nodded, wiping at tears. “Sure, yeah, I’ll see you then.”

“What do you think is at the end of the road?” she asked. “Do you think I’ll have time to find out before I wake up?”

I looked out at the road, scanning the trees for any hungry shadows. “I don’t know, I don’t know where it goes but...promise me you’ll be careful.”

My mom smiled wider. “Of course I’ll be careful.”

“And she won’t walk alone,” said a familiar voice behind us both.

I turned, expecting the starry thing. But the man standing on the road was entirely normal. The light from the moon was enough that I could see he had moss green eyes and a bright shock of red hair.

“Such a beautiful dream,” my mother said.

The man came towards us and took my mother’s hand. He and I looked so alike, I could see why my mother confused us when she was sick.

“Take care of her,” I told the man. “I…just please take care of her, make sure she gets where she’s going. There are, well, there are things out there that want her, to hurt her, it’s, it’s my fault, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry-”

The man squeezed my shoulder. “She’ll be safe, watched over. If the Devil himself is waiting on the road ahead *he’ll move.* Or he’ll be moved.”

I believed him.

Thoughts raced through my head. There were so many things I wanted to say, questions, a million ways to say goodbye. I wanted to stretch out the moment for as long as I could but I realized I’d already delayed my mother enough.

“I love you,” I told them both. “Goodbye.”

I woke up back in my dining room sitting at the table, the unlit candle in front of me. The house was quiet and still. There was no more scratching, no sound or sense of life at all. I walked through every room. The house was empty. I was alone.

I’ve spent the past couple months working on the house, erasing the marks I’d made, fixing up the property. Some nights I take long walks out into the forest. I’m far enough out in the country that on clear nights it’s like looking up at a sea of stars. I think about my parents the most during those walks, I grieve and remember in my own way. And I wonder where their road went, if they’re still traveling or if they reached their destination.

I hope that their road takes them strange and beautiful places. When I walk at night, I look up for the North Star to keep from getting lost. Maybe they do the same.

When it’s full, I also look up towards the moon. I wonder if my parents had a chance to visit, to search for hidden oceans. I like to think they did, that the moon has at least one Maria, the one I love most.

[Hello](https://travisbrownwriting.com)",Entertainment
nosleep,I had a disturbing conversation with my 7-year-old daughter.,"""Dad, *dad*! I saw a *zombie*!""

I was in the kitchen making tea when my little girl came rushing in. She ran through the back door so fast she almost tripped up the step. I poured boiling water from the kettle into a mug, hardly looking up.

""Oh yeah?""

""Yeah, I did! Its face was all pale and messed up! It was *gross*, dad!""

I put the kettle back and picked up the milk. Sighed inwardly. I *really* had to be more careful about what I watched on TV in the evening. Rosie has a habit of sneaking downstairs in the night, and last week she caught me watching *The Walking Dead*, of all things. She's had zombies on the brain ever since. I keep telling her they're not real, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.

""Sweetheart, what did we say about zombies?"" I scooped the teabag out of the mug and dumped it in the bin. ""You know if you keep talking about them, daddy's going to get in trouble with mummy again.""

""Yeah, but I *saw* one.""

""I know, darling, but I already checked the back garden twice yesterday, and I can promise you it's a zombie-free zone.""

""No, not in the back garden.""

""Hm?""

""I didn't see it in the back garden.""

I had the mug half raised to my lips, but now I put it down again. I turned to look at Rosie. Her hair was wind-swept and her little cheeks were red, as if she'd been running.

""Sweetheart."" I put on my best stern, dad's-not-happy voice. ""I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to be honest with me: Have you been playing along the path out back again?""

I didn't really need to ask the question, because I already knew the answer. Rosie is allowed to play in the garden on her own, and sometimes – if she asks us permission first – we let her ride her bike along the path at the back of our house. The one that runs past all the neighbour's back gardens. But that's *all* we allow her to do. This area is pretty safe, but these days you can never be too careful. There was a burglary a couple of roads over a few months back, and last year someone was mugged on the high street. Several years ago, a few towns over, a little boy even went missing. That was quite a long way away from here, of course, but it made national news for a few days until the search fizzled out. And it made a lot of parents more cautious. Rosie's getting older now, and she's an adventurous girl, but still – you have to have boundaries. And on a few occasions lately, Rosie's been crossing those boundaries. Riding her bike further than she should. Not coming in straight away when we call her. Sneaking out the back gate when she's only meant to be playing in the garden.

As I watched Rosie now, I noticed her face growing redder. She looked away from me, down at the kitchen floor, and scuffed her feet.

""Dad, I only went a *little* way down,"" she said. ""I *promise*. I was chatting to Mr Henderson, because I saw him in his back garden. I said hello and made him jump!""

I sighed. So there it was: Mr Henderson was Rosie's zombie. Yesterday it was the postman, and the day before that it was a different neighbour. I took a sip of tea and shook my head. Mr Henderson was, in fairness, a better candidate than the others. The guy lives on his own, and he looks about 100 years old. Moles all over his face. Skin like a deflated balloon. Whenever we'd chatted over the garden fence before, though, he'd always seemed nice enough. Just a bit lonely. I couldn't have Rosie going round calling him a zombie.

""Listen to me, sweetheart. I know you didn't go far or anything, but I don't want you–""

""I came right back after too, dad!"" Rosie interrupted. She was staring up at me now, blue eyes large and pleading. ""I promise! And I even said no when Mr Henderson offered me an ice cream, because I know you don't like me taking stuff from strangers!""

I opened my mouth to respond, then paused. ""He offered you ice cream?""

""Yeah, but I said no! Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one, but I told him I had to get home! And then I came straight back here to tell you I'd seen a zombie, and I...""

Rosie was babbling now, her voice whirring like a motor. But I'd stopped listening. My mind was still stuck on something she'd said a moment before.

*Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one*.

I took another sip of tea and frowned. That wasn't good. I didn't mind the neighbours chatting to my little girl, but I didn't like the thought of them inviting her in. Not without us there. Not even if they were just kind, lonely old men. I made up my mind to go round and visit Mr Henderson later, and to tell him that myself – kindly, of course, but firmly. 

In the end, though, I didn't get a chance. Because a few moments after I'd had the thought, Rosie said something else. Something that pushed everything else from my mind, and ended any idea I might have had about going over to Mr Henderson's house. She said something that made me feel cold.

""Daddy, please don't stop me playing in the garden. I *promise* I won't sneak out again. I don't want the zombie to get me.""

""Rosie, I'm not going to stop you playing in the garden. But you have to make *me* a couple of promises, too. First, promise me you'll stop going round calling people zombies. Mr Henderson my be old, but he's not one of the living dead.""

Rosie frowned. ""I didn't.""

""What do you mean, you didn't? You just ran in here a moment ago calling him one.""

""No, I *didn't*. Mr Henderson's not a zombie. I saw the zombie in his house, but it wasn't him.""

I frowned. I had the mug raised to my lips to take another sip of tea, but now I put it down again. ""What do you mean, sweetheart? You saw someone else in his house?""

""Yeah, the *zombie*, dad! I could see it pressed against his little basement window while I was talking to him.""

Cold fingers ran up my spine. ""What?""

nosleep,My dead girlfriend keeps messaging me on Facebook. I’ve got the screenshots. I don’t know what to do.,"Tonight’s kind of a catalyst for this post. I just received another message, and it’s worse than any of the others. 

My girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.

We had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn’t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.

That being said, she wasn’t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, “If I kark it first, don’t just say good things about me. I’ve never liked that. If you don’t pay me out, you’re doing me a disservice. I’ve got so many flaws, and that’s just part of me.” So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. 

I know that’s tangential, but I don’t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. 

Onto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me.

[**September 4, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily’s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I ‘share’ access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.

---
[**November 16th, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn’t logged in to Em’s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy ‘friends’ fucking with me in the worst possible way. 

I noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my’s shared chat history.](http://i.imgur.com/fw80ZJG.png)

The ‘the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. ‘hello’ happened a million times.

---
Around **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. ‘She’ would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I’ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I’ve caught, so they’re a little out of the timeline I’m trying to write out):

http://i.imgur.com/X9G5agJ.png

http://i.imgur.com/55FwXKt.png

Around this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. 

She would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn’t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.

At this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn’t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can’t get out there, though, it’s nice having my friends available to chat. It’s nice visiting Em’s page when the little green circle isn’t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.

---
[On **March 15th,**](http://i.imgur.com/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.

---
[**On March 25th**, I received an ‘answer’.](http://i.imgur.com/j3HwZzv.png)

It wasn’t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.
 
My response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him/her with emotional ‘bait’ (‘This is actually devastating’) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather ‘evidence’.

Before anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.

---
[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http://i.imgur.com/uvadlGa.png)

This seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it’s recycled from previous messages she’s sent.

---
[**29th of April.**](http://i.imgur.com/FGmhuUQ.png)

I hadn’t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they’re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum’s house, etc). My response here wasn’t bait. ‘yo ask Nathan’ was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing ‘her’ say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I’m not expecting my bond back.

Her last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn’t admit it at this point.

---
[**8th of May.** I don’t really have the words for this.](http://i.imgur.com/GNL8TcO.png)

‘FRE EZIN G’ is the first original word she’s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she’s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I’m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn’t even realise I’m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.

---
[**24th of May.**](http://i.imgur.com/z295fHw.png)

I wasn’t actually drunk. She wasn’t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange ‘I love you’s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.

Her reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it’s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend’s. 

In the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. 

---
[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http://i.imgur.com/ujUNJQm.png)

These are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You’ll see why I’m showing you these soon.

---
[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http://imgur.com/W6qzAZI)

I memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she’d been quiet; she wasn’t even tagging herself in my photos. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don’t know what’s happening. 

I just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.

nosleep,Something went wrong with my heart transplant,"I’ve always had a weak heart.

Not just physically, I’ve always been afraid of my own shadow. It was unsurprising when the doctors told me my heart murmur wasn’t just a heart murmur. A year of tests. A year of therapy, constant trips to the hospital and I was finally told that it had all been for nothing.

My poor weak heart wouldn’t last till Christmas. It’s a strange thing being told that you’re dying; I didn’t come to terms with it at first. I drank and I spent my money. I did reckless, stupid things because I was so damn scared.

Then I got the news. That a young woman called Laura had been declared brain dead and that I, the lucky chosen one, would be getting a brand new heart a week later. I drove to the hospital slowly, carefully, and readied myself for the ordeal that was to come.

As I was laying in bed on the last night, the thought of Laura swirled around in my head and it wouldn’t leave me alone. It was like her name was in flashing lights every time I closed my eyes.

It was wrong, I know it was, but I had to see the woman who was giving me her heart. It didn’t feel right not to put a face to the one who was saving my life. I knew her name, I knew what ward she was staying on- I had overheard the two nurses discussing it. I wandered down the meandering hallways until I found what I was looking for, taking my time, making sure I didn’t miss any name. I guess I had time on my hands now.

In the second to last room, she lay in bed. A woman sat on the bed next to her, holding her hand, and my own weak heart stuttered.

“Excuse me.” I had no idea what to say to her. “I’m Jenna. I’m the person… I’m having surgery tomorrow and..” What I assumed was Laura’s mother stood up and I could tell from the look in her eye that she knew who I was.

“Thank you for visiting. I know it’s strange, but a part of her is going to be living on in you. I wanted to meet you.” I stood there, helpless and lost for words. Laura’s mother beckoned me over.

“Please.” She said. “Don’t feel uncomfortable. Its what she would have wanted.” I sat on the chair next to Laura.

“How did she-“ I broke off. It was too awful to ask. Laura’s mother gave me a thin smile.

“She was a care worker. Looked after battered wives, abused women. Last month she met a guy and… Well. I suppose years of training can’t help you when you’re in love. She ignored the warning signs. And he killed her. She dedicated her life to those who needed her.” Laura’s mother looked down. I don’t know why I did it, but I reached over, and held Laura’s hand. I squeezed it.

“I’m so sorry. I had a boyfriend once who… He was like that too. Someone like Laura convinced me to leave.” Laura’s mother gave me another half smile. I could see the tears in her eyes.

Then Laura squeezed my hand. Tightly. She gripped me so hard that her fingernails dug into my skin. I recoiled, a look of horror on my face. Laura’s mother looked at me calmly.

“She squeezes my hand sometimes as well. I think the Doctors called it muscle spasms. Either way. There’s none of Laura left in there anymore.” I looked at the small crescent moons that had just started to bleed on the palm of my hand.

The surgery went perfectly. I was wheeled to the recovery suite after it was over and done with, the raised wound on my chest covered by gauze. It was better if I didn’t see it, I thought. I didn’t need any more heart issues. I spent the first day doped up on the pain medication, eating only a little and sitting up maybe two times. It was a long process, they reassured me.

Laura’s mother came to visit me the day before I was due to leave. Her calm demeanor hadn’t wavered but I could see that she was suffering. She looked ten years older, and her hands shook when she gave me a hug.

“When are you going home?”

“Tomorrow.” I told her. “Please, come visit whenever you want.” I started to jot down my address for her, when out of the corner of my eye, a flash of blonde disappeared through the doorway. The same brilliant blonde as Laura’s hair.

“Ow!” I cried out suddenly. It felt like someone had sharply squeezed my hand so hard it had almost crushed the bones. Laura’s mother rushed to my side, a look of concern in her eyes.

“What’s wrong? Is it your heart?” She stumbled over the last words, coming to terms with what she had said. I tried to reassure her and said I’d let the doctors know, and she left with a look of worry on her face.

When I looked down, a new set of crescent fingernail marks were below the ones that Laura’s had made. Ten identical bleeding smiles.

The taxi ride home was short, and before I knew it I was back in my own flat. It felt strange to try and slot back into where I had left off, my life had been almost over the last time I had been here. I looked over the mess and the cardboard boxes, the remnants of one night where I had tearfully tried to pack and store my belongings so my parents wouldn’t have to do it when I died.

Laura’s heart beat so strongly it felt like it would come out of my chest. It did this all the time, and I realized this was what a healthy heart must feel like. So why couldn’t I shake my feeling of unease?

That night, I had a dream.

Laura was in her hospital bed, but her mother was gone. I could hear my heart, Laura’s heart, beating in my eardrums so loudly it was painful. I tried to cover them, but my hands were pinned to my sides. Some unexplainable force was moving me towards the motionless figure of Laura on the bed, her lips were blue and the window had come open, whipping her blonde hair around her face.

I was almost on top of her when her eyes flew open.

They were milky white, the eyes of someone dead.

“Get out.” She rasped, her voice guttural. I could hear the heartbeat faster and faster, drumming until I thought I couldn’t take it anymore.

Then I woke up. The sound had been real. Laura’s heart was so loud it felt like it would rupture my eardrums and I screamed in agony, trying to cover my ears. It was useless, it was coming from some deep place inside me, I could feel it reverberating around the hollows of my chest.

I stumbled out of bed, gasping for air, and tried to find my phone. I needed to call someone, anyone, an ambulance or my mom. Anyone that would pick up.

“Get out.” It was a faint whisper over the hammering thumps of Laura’s heart, a low guttural voice that sounded like it had been made by an animal, and I crawled to the door, down the hallway, choking on my screams for help. My neighbor opened the door, his eyes as wide as saucers at the sight of me on the floor clutching my chest.

He drove me to hospital as I cried in the passenger seat of his car.

After about fifty different checkups, the doctors told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with me. They told me my heart was regular, my blood pressure was normal, and that everything was going just swimmingly. I stood in the waiting area, wallowing in my shame and frustration.

That heart didn’t belong to me.

My phone buzzed on the counter, an unknown number. Great. That was all I needed, more unexplained, scary things like a stranger on the end of the phone. My voice sounded small on the line,

“Hello?”

“Good morning, this is the Thames Valley police, we’ve called to report an incident that occurred in your flat at around 1.30am today.” I felt a wave of embarrassment.

“I’m so sorry, I recently had surgery and I wasn’t feeling well. I had to have my neighbor drive me to the hospital and I think I panicked a little in the hallway before I left.” There was a small silence on the other end of the phone.

“I’m afraid this is something you might want to be sitting down for.” I felt Laura’s heart beats, strong and calm. “There was an incident of forced entry by Mr Samuel Matthews, according to our police records he’s your ex partner and you filed a restraining order against him in September 2017.” My blood ran cold.

“I did.”

“He’s in police custody. We found an automatic weapon on him and we believe he had the intent to harm you. We have an officer currently stationed at your flat who can fill you in depending on how long your hospital stay will be.”

I thanked him and hung up the phone.

For a moment, I leant against the wall, the horror slowly spreading over me. If I had been in my flat ten minutes later he would have found me.

Laura’s heartbeats filled my ears again but now they were gentle, calming. Her mother said she dedicated every part of her to helping those who needed it.

I put both my hands on my chest, overwhelmed by my own gratitude, and listened to Laura.",Entertainment
nosleep,My girlfriend talks in her sleep. She's been saying the most horrible things recently...,"I’m infatuated with her. 

Utterly infatuated.  

And it wasn’t at a healthy level.  Far from it.  I would think about her every moment she was away.  I would sometimes sit on my couch and just stare at my phone waiting for her to text.  I’d tell myself “Don’t contact her.  *Don't*.   It will come off as too strong.”  But then I’d still find myself clicking her name on my contact list before my inner voice would continue, “You don’t want her to know how desperately smitten you are with her.  It’s unattractive.  It will scare her off.  No, you must wait for her to call you this time.”

But it was excruciating and exhausting.  Almost unbearable.  I once heard that the ancient Greeks believed that falling madly and irrationally in love with somebody was a curse that you would wish upon your enemies.  I could never understand what they meant.  After all, isn’t falling head over heels in love the ultimate goal nowadays?  But now that it’s happened to me, I have to say… the ancient Greeks were right.  This is a curse.  I was barely in control of myself.  Almost as though my infatuation with her had… possessed me.

The two of us were sexually active together but still in the “dating” phase.  We were at that make or break era of a blossoming relationship where we’d either have “the talk” and formally be in a relationship or we’d start to slowly drift apart.  The latter of which I don’t think I’d be able to cope with.  Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to.  Almost everything about her captivated me.  The way she held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  How she’d caress the pendant of her necklace when she was frightened.  How she’d twirl her hair in her finger when she was excited.   All of it.  Her smell.  Her smile.  Her eyes.  

Yeah, I know.  It probably makes you sick reading about it.  I feel the same way.  I was never the hopeless romantic type.  But now I can’t stop fantasizing about her.  I’d think about us doing the long three-hour hike up to that magnificent view from one of our first dates.  To that first kiss, as we overlooked the lights of the city.  But this time I’d get down on one knee, bring out the ring, and… well… you know what would happen next.  

Alright, fine.  I’ll stop.  Yes, this is a girl I’d only been casually dating for a couple of months.  I shouldn’t be thinking about proposing yet.  I know that.  I'm just barely able to control myself any longer.  I feel as though I’m losing power over the decisions I make. 

And that brings me to why I’m here writing this out at the moment.  It started with the first real thing that troubled me about her. We’d never actually spent a night together.  No matter how late she was over, once either of us showed signs of being tired, she’d up and leave.  She wouldn’t leave awkwardly or in anger. Just a casual kiss good night, a smile, and a “call me soon”. 

It was something I didn’t really even notice the first few times she did it.  But after almost 8 weeks of dating, it was becoming strange.  I’d have to ask her about it.

It took drinking almost an entire bottle of wine before I had the courage to do it.  She looked almost defeated when I asked and lowered her eyes in embarrassment.  “I knew this talk would come eventually,” She started.  She took in a deep breath with a long drawn out exhale.  “Recently….“  she paused again.  “I’ve started talking in my sleep.”  She shook her head in embarrassment.    “It’s called somniloquy, I looked it up.”  

I shrugged and laughed out loud.  My demeanor seemed to say “That’s it?”

“No, Stephen… listen” she said.  She wasn’t laughing.  “It’s bad.  It… It’s completely out of control.  It’s not just random words or gibberish.  No.  It’s horrible.  I say horrible disgusting things.”  She was starting to raise her voice, breath heavy,  and tear up.

I approached her and held her.  I told her it couldn’t be that bad.  I told her to spend the night.  I told her she was probably exaggerating.  

I was wrong.

That night she stayed at my house.  But she warned me of something before falling asleep.  “Whatever you do, don’t wake me up.  It makes me really scared and disoriented if that happens.  And don’t respond to me.  Just ignore it.”  I nodded and agreed.   “If it becomes too much,” she continued, “just leave the room and sleep on the couch.  I won’t mind.”

I told her not to worry about it. I told her that it wouldn’t be a big deal.  I told her I wouldn’t leave to the couch.  I’d stay beside her in the bed.

But I was wrong.

I couldn’t even last one night.

***

We both fell asleep without incident.  I don’t know how many hours passed, but I woke up in the dark with the sensation that someone was watching me.  And then I remembered… *She* was with me.  She was actually spending the night.  I smiled.

But then I noticed the shadowy outline of her sitting up on the bed.  She was looking down at me.  Staring.  

It creeped me out.  I’ll admit it.  Her posture was entirely different.  It was as though it wasn’t even her at all.

Then she spoke.

It wasn’t her voice that I heard.  It was much lower and gravelly.  Like something out of a horror movie.

“*I’ll chew the skin from your bones.*”  She said.

I froze. 

At first, I just kept looking at her.  This was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be more like the way Tourette’s is often portrayed.  Just random swearing and shouting.   I honestly thought to myself… what will I do if she attacks me right now?  What if she really does try to chew the skin from my bones?  

But then she just lied down and went back to sleep.

I was creeped out.  I tried to lie back down and ignore her but struggled.  I couldn’t even close my eyes without thinking “Maybe she’s sitting up again and staring at me.”  And then one time I rolled over to look at her…and she *was*.

Her face was pressed right towards mine.  Her breath was foul and rotted.  Something that was most certainly not normal for her.  She spoke again, in the same voice as before.

“*If you don’t move to the couch, you’ll be dead by morning.*”

That did it for me.  I sat up in a moment and headed for the living room.

She made some sort of wheezing sound as I left.  I think it was supposed to be laughter.

I was lying on the couch, but I wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep.  I was far too shaken.

I was staring out towards the window, hoping to see the first few hints of the sun rising.

And then I thought I heard something.  From the bedroom.

I listened.

And then I heard it again. 

“*Stephen.*”   It was that same low and gravelly voice. It sounded like a witch. 

I tried to just ignore it at first.  But then it continued. 

“*Stephen.*”  

Still I said nothing.  

“*I know you can hear me, Stephen.  You’re awake now.  Why don’t you come back into the bedroom?*”

The voice barely sounded human.  

“*Or maybe you’d prefer if I come to **you**?*”

I still didn’t say anything.  I was told not to.  But I listened.  If I heard her start walking towards the bedroom door, I’m not even joking, I would have run right out of the apartment. But she had asked me not to respond to her sleep talking.  So I didn’t.

And then I heard her once more.

“*Sorry if this spoils your plans.*”   She began laughing.  “*The two of you were supposed to walk that trail again.*” she started.  I wasn’t even remotely prepared for what she’d say next.

 “*You’d both be so tired when you’d reach the top.  You’d look over the city.  Then you’ll get on one knee, and bring out the ring.*”  She began laughing. 

And that’s when I realized this wasn’t just a problem with sleep talking.  It was something much more.  Something supernatural.  I had never told anybody about my proposal fantasy.  There was simply no way she could have known about any of it.

This was no longer about merely talking in ones’ sleep.  This was about possession. I can’t go back into the bedroom.  I have no idea what would happen if I did.  Instead, I’m going to wait it out, holding up in my living room until the sun rises.  I have a couple more hours yet.  I can hear her laughing occasionally in the bedroom. It’s still not her voice. Still that same low pitch cackle.

But as I sit on my couch writing this out, here’s what scares me the most…

Maybe my infatuation and utter obsession with her wasn’t normal.  I said before that I felt like I was losing control of myself.  More so I believe than the typical falling in love story.  No.  I fear that the infatuation I felt was the entity slowly taking control of *me*.  Of it controlling my thoughts, fears, ambitions, and anxieties.  Maybe once I become completely absorbed, a transfer would occur, and she would be free of it. 

I know I should leave.  That I should open the front door, get in my car, and drive away from here.  But I can’t. I can’t leave her.  I’ve already lost control.

I’m infatuated with her.

This was the message I was greeted by in the middle of an episode of Big Bang Theory in my living room. Frozen halfway through a forkful of Kraft Mac N' Cheese, I sat bolt upright and turned around to look out the window. The sky, as I thought, was crystal clear. A few clouds, but nothing crazy. No rain. No thunder. Nothing. Confused, I turned off the TV, erasing the alert from the screen. My two dogs came walking over to me and I patted them on their heads. One of my dogs, the other's brother, was shaking profusely from the buzzing noise that always shows up with Amber Alerts and the like. I left them in the living room and walked through my kitchen and onto my front porch. My neighbors, too, were standing outside their houses, all looking at the sky in bemusement.

An immediate threat? It didn't seem like it, I thought as my phone started buzzing with the same tone. One by one, everyone else's phones started ringing.

I should explain, I guess, that I have never experienced a severe weather warning for real. Not once in my life. I suppose it should come as no surprise, seeing as I live in Oregon of all places. I supposed maybe it was just a mistake, but just as the thought floated across my mind, I heard the  siren.

The siren of the squad car coming down the street. An officer talked through the speaker. ""This is not a drill. Please enter your homes immediately. Do not go outside under any circumstances.""

Never the kind of guy to ignore higher authorities, I entered my house nervously, turned off all the lights on the above-ground floors, and took my dogs into my basement with a sleeping bag, some food, my phone, a charger, some spare batteries, flashlight, and other essentials. I called my brother, who lives a couple of blocks away, and asked him if he had gotten the message. He had. I considered saying we should stay together to wait out the storm, but then I figured we'd probably get in trouble for that. So I hung up, got comfortable on my sleeping bag, and started browsing Reddit. Eventually, I fell asleep, seeing as I was under stress and had woken up pretty early. When I woke up, I realized that I still didn't hear any rain. Seriously, nothing at all. More confused than ever, I decided to see if the alert had been called off. I turned on my phone and called my brother again. It went straight to voicemail, though, so I gave up. I decided to risk it and go upstairs. I had to squeeze between the door and the wall to keep my dogs from following me upstairs, but I won and they stayed in the basement. I walked through my kitchen to the front door and looked out the window part of it. As I squinted to see outside in the dark (strange, seeing as it was only 2:00 PM judging by my clock), the TV flickered briefly. I looked around at it and it flickered again, but this time every device on the ground floor flickered. Thinking little of it, I turned around and looked through the door again. Every house on the block had its lights turned off. Nobody was outside.

Except for one teenage girl.

A thin, short-haired girl wearing what looked like a pillowcase walked unsteadily down the street, very slowly, looking as though she was having some difficulty. I turned around, now extremely confused and worried, and got the dogs' food bowls, which I had forgotten earlier. When I looked up, one of the houses, the one diagonally across from mine (right next to the house across the street and to the left) had it's lights on and one of its windows broken. I shuddered and rushed back into the basement as the lights flickered intensely.

I locked the door to the basement and sat on an old, tattered couch that I had brought down here--the basement is where I put everything I didn't have room for. So, yeah, it's packed. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something that may be worth noting: I live in a small town. A very small town, probably with a population of under 500. Or less. As a matter of fact, it isn't even on most maps. We never make any news, we never have any scandals or anything. This is the first interesting thing that's happened, I think, since Mrs. [withheld] lost her dentures to a raccoon. So, it's possible this whole thing seems way worse than it is.

Call me crazy, but until a few minutes ago, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I love these scenarios, and my basement is totally secure, so I'm having the time of my life. Well, I was. I decided to turn on my radio--what harm could it do, as long as I didn't turn the volume up to high?

I was surprised to find that our local radio station was still up and running. They were talking about the weather, so I listened hard for any news that I hadn't heard. There wasn't any--they were just as confused as us. Not wanting to listen to crappy pop music indefinitely, I tuned into another station. This one was one I hadn't heard before.

-""Could you give me the status of [withheld] county? Over.""
-""No new developments. Over.""
-""Okay. Any fatalities? Over.""
-""What part of ""no new developments"" do you not understand, McClellan? A squad car will be passing through soon to scan the area for the target. Over.""
-""Any ETA on that? Over.""
-""No, not yet. Over.""
-""And any word from HQ, Jones? Over.""
-""No, McClellan. Not yet. Not since 013 first got out. Over.""
-""Well, let me know if and when they contact you. Over.""

At that point, I lost the signal. Well, not really, but the connection got so weak that I could barely make out anything they were saying. I figured I must have found a police communication channel. And I had been left with no answers whatsoever.

That was about forty-five minutes ago, as of me writing this now. Guys, I don't know what's going on. Do any of you live near me? You'll know if you've received the warning. I'd say what county I live in, and which ones were affected, but I don't know to for privacy reasons. Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated, okay? Until then, wish me luck.

EDIT: Woah, guys, this has blown up. I'll be sure to keep you posted over the next few days!

UPDATE: Just a quick update before the first major update--about five minutes ago, a car alarm went off somewhere to the right of my house. I'm too freaked out to go check it out, but I'll go up and see how it looks tomorrow morning, and I'll update you then.

nosleep,I knew a woman who never took off her wedding dress,"Pauline was a sweet woman who lived across the street. We weren’t close as kids or teenagers because she was around five years older than me, but our parents were friends. I think she babysat me when I was younger too.

When my mother learned that Pauline was engaged, she sent me to help on the bridal shower. Poor mom, she thought I was like that because I was too often around boys and needed to learn to be more feminine, but she’s got that backwards.

That’s when I first learned that Pauline and her soon-to-be husband had made a blood oath.

“The first to die comes and takes the other as soon as they can”, she explained to me, swirling the ruby ring gently around her fingers.

“Isn’t that too dramatic? What if you end up divorcing and marrying other people?”

“We won’t. We are soulmates!” she assured me. Her naïveté made her incredibly beautiful, but it felt really wrong being 21 and thinking that I was so much more mature than a 26 years-old.

I didn’t pursue the matter, but she kept talking about him in a dreamy tone. *Aiden would like this*, *I wish Aiden was here*, and so on. Her dreamy tone almost made me believe that soulmates existed and that you could make the person you love the most follow you in death by just willing it.

I met Pauline’s friends, and we all ended up having some quality girl time. Pauline explained to us all how she believed that you can wake up in the afterlife and start controlling things with your mind.

“Of course your memories will be hazy”, she clarified. “But that’s why we made the blood oath. So we can remember.”

“And how will one get the other back?” I asked, entertaining her.

“I like to believe that we’ll both grow wings!”

It was all terribly silly when I think back, but Pauline had something about her that made everyone pay attention and marvel at her words.

Despite the age gap, we ended up becoming good friends; I think we were finally at an age where it didn’t matter anymore. Since I was in college but lived with my parents and didn’t need to work, I had a lot of spare time to accompany her to wedding dress fittings, cake tasting and all the little things that were the world for brides.

But Pauline was a pleasant bride-to-be and never freaked out; she was just thrilled about marrying the man of her dreams, and wanted to make it pretty if possible.

Little by little, I grew to understand her devotion to Aiden. And he was just as crazy about her, if not more. When they were together the world felt like a brighter and warmer place. Like marshmallows slowly melting over my heart.

The day of the wedding came, around half a year after her bridal shower.

It was neither a big nor a small wedding – it felt like both Pauline and Aiden were able to invite exactly everyone they wanted around on their happiest day. Not one more, not one less. I felt somewhat honored to be there.

Still, the happiest day never came.

When Pauline arrived, belated as any bride should, there was whispering and disquiet; Aiden wasn’t there yet. 

Her smile didn’t falter, because she was completely sure that he would never bail on her. But I could tell she was worried. The bridesmaids – her two closest friends since high school – started making calls to try to find out if the groom had a sudden illness.

Soon they realized that Aiden’s parents were there, but not his brother. They informed that their other son was supposed to drive the groom as part of his best man’s duties.

When the devastating news came, everyone wanted to comfort her, everyone wanted desperately to protect her precious heart, but it was too torn apart to notice anyone else.

*It was all too fast and scary. (…) A sports car ran a red light straight into the Mirage. (…) The man in the passenger seat was dead on arrival. (…) The driver was taken to the hospital but his state was critical.*

It was all so hard on everyone. Aiden’s brother ended up surviving, but he’ll be tetraplegic for life due to severe injury on his spinal cord. As far as I know, he’s also miserable because he wished he could be the one who died.

Right after the wedding that never happened, Pauline and Aiden’s parents dealt with selling the house they had just bought, and Pauline continued living with her parents. They both still worked office jobs, so her other friends and I started taking turns keeping her company while they weren’t home.

I did my best to be there for my neighbor and friend, but *she* wasn’t there. She was living in delusion, and the only thing you could see leaking into reality was her desolation. 

I never saw such a deep and heart-wrenching sadness. Pauline refused to take off her dress. She would spend the whole day by the window waiting for Aiden and the whole night crying because she missed him desperately. Every single day.

She was hopeful it was a matter of time until he woke up on the other side and remembered to bring her along. That’s why she wouldn’t take off the dress – he had died on his wedding suit, so it was only natural that she was up to par.

Her parents and every single one of her friends tried to coax her into changing her clothes. We promised she could always keep the dress close for when Aiden came, but she knew that we didn’t really believe he would. It was like promising your kid that you’d buy them a Happy Meal some other day. 

No one dared to penetrate her grief and force her out of the dress. She spent the day in it, slept in it, even bathed in it; since we live in a warm and arid weather, having it dry wasn’t an issue, only everything else.

The once beautiful organza and silk were now ragged, grimy and smelling. But she still refused to take it off. She started to believe that Aiden wouldn’t be able to spot her in the crowd if she wasn’t wearing it.

It was impossible to change her mind, and even though she was seeing a therapist three times a week, she wasn’t improving. Her mourning and PTSD were turning into a darker, more permanent mental illness.

She started talking to Aiden, then explained to us that he was nearby, so she could feel him coming. He was just taking a while because flying is really hard when your wings are newly-acquired.

Then one morning, she disappeared for good. No one saw her leaving, and no one saw her at all after that.

The only thing that we were able to find, in the small grove behind the house, was her filthy wedding dress. It had two large holes poked on her back, like it had grown wings.

\*\*\*

After finding the dress, everyone who loved Pauline was relieved; her mother readily admitted that she actually believed that Aiden somehow had come back to take her. Others weren’t so fond of the supernatural explanation, but thinking that there was a chance that it happened brought us a sense of closure.

It’s not that we were happy about her death, but we conformed to the possibility of her finally finding her peace.

She was an angel, after all. Why wouldn’t she grow wings and escape her flesh prison?

The family held a beautiful memorial service in her honor, and slowly we all started moving on with our lives.

Now, you might ask what I believe in. I would laugh bitterly because I don’t have this choice to begin with.

Being the person who spent the most time watching Pauline those days, it was only natural that I was the one to found her dead in the bathtub. Hiding and subsequently getting rid of her body was the hardest thing I have ever done; tampering with the dress, though, was eerily healing.

Still, I think that she would be pleased to know that I faked her rapture. 

A romantic and mystifying death fitted her way more than suicide[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)",Entertainment
nosleep,"My Mother-In-Law was poisoning me, then I found out why","Everyone has their own nightmare in-law story, though I couldn't imagine how bad mine would be. As it turns out the worst thing wasn't my mother-in-law poisoning me, the worst thing was why she did it.

I met Craig on one of my rare vacations and we had sort of a whirlwind relationship. We fell hard for each other and were married in a courthouse wedding within two months without ever meeting each other's families. Mine visited a few weeks later and after their initial shock really liked Craig.

While we got moved in together and figured out married life I got to hear more about his parents who lived near the rest of his extended family a few hours away, though we never saw them. My work schedule is rough. I work 6-7 days a week and my off days are a blur of appointments and errands, I think in the two years before I met Craig I only left the city once!

I finally got a few days off so we could head to visit his family about six months later. His whole family came over and everyone seemed thrilled to meet me, except for his mom, Betsy. She was cold and distant, and could sit there without saying a single word to me. It was creepy, but I kept trying to spark up a conversation.

On our last day he announced that we should take an afternoon hike up into the national park their house sat on the edge of. Betsy made lunch and I was changing to go out when it hit me, just waves of nausea. I wound up in the bathroom for hours that afternoon.

I figure it was just a touch of something and thought nothing of it. We went back a few months months later and again had a great time except for Betsy. She wouldn't talk to me, though Craig brushed it off and said she was just getting to know me. He finally said we could rent jet-skis the next day and explore a lake in the next town as a way to get out of the house and unwind, which made me feel better. I was so excited to tell everyone where we were going, but it wasn't to be. After eating I got so sick I could barely walk for the next two days.

At this point I started to get suspicious. No one else was sick, and we all ate the same food. It seemed like Betsy must have been up to something, but it wasn't until our next visit when a night in a romantic cottage another hour up the road was cancelled due to me getting sick that I was sure: Betsy was poisoning me.

Craig said I was insane. He said it must be an allergy to something his mom used in her cooking, which actually made sense, though I never had time for an appointment to get it checked out. Still, I decided on the next trip that I'd make a big casserole and bring it with us. If I cooked the food and served it, nothing could be added.

Well, I hadn't had two bites before I realized I had left the wine I was drinking unattended while I was heating up the casserole, and my stomach was already doing flips. You know what happened next, and it was not pretty.

I was so sure his mom was poisoning me, and I confronted Craig about it. I told him I wouldn't visit his family again if she was there. It was our first big fight, but he finally said he wouldn't force me to visit, and we could figure out how best to deal with the situation. She had never been nice to me, so it wasn't a loss.

The next time I got time off we decided we'd head to that little cottage we had rented before and not been able to use. We were driving right past his family's place, and it seemed rude not to stop, so we compromised and bought some pizzas. I even decided just not to drink anything unless it was water from the tap.

We got in and threw pizza on our plates when one of his cousins arrived and everyone briefly left the food unattended. I realized my mistake almost immediately, and decided to try an experiment. Craig and I both had two slices, so I just switched our plates while everyone was in the next room.

Craig was so sick I was really worried about him. The drive back to the city was awful, we had to pull off a lot, and he was a mess. We had been back home for three days before I broke down and told him I had switched the plates.

I've never seen such anger before, the rage in his eyes is something I'll remember for the rest of my life. He shoved me into a wall and then came flying at me. He threw me over the couch, but I somehow managed to grab my keys and phone and ran out the door not even wearing shoes.

I got lucky with the elevator and made it to a friend's place safely, finally turning off my phone after I missed his 47th call. I had no idea what to do or when it would be safe to go home, it was the scariest time of my life.

It was two days before I turned my phone back on, and when I heard the message from the police I drove upstate immediately.

Craig was dead, Betsy had shot him after he broke into her house and charged at her with a knife.

I learned that Craig had been married once before, and his wife had died on a tragic hiking accident. Craig made a lot of money in the life insurance payout and Betsy always suspected Craig had killed her, and was nervous about letting him be alone with me, especially out in the remote area he was so familiar with from his childhood.

So she ensured that every time he planned an outing that I would be sick. It wasn't easy, but she didn't think I would believe her, as no one else had ever shared her suspicions about Craig.

I found the life insurance policies he took out on me without my knowledge afterward, and refused to press charges against Betsy, she was only trying to protect me. I still visit her from time to time when I need to get out of the city, [I love her cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/nmwrites/).",Entertainment
nosleep,All of the women in my family die at age 27. I turn 28 in 2 hours and 32 minutes.,"My dad always wanted a son. He got three daughters instead.

He hated us all, hated my twin sisters, hated my mother… but hated me most of all because I was the last child my mother had before she died. That didn’t stop him from treating me like his little boy, didn’t stop him from attempting to beat the hatred of my own gender into me. *Quit your crying*, he’d snap, *or you’ll end up like your sniveling bitch of a mother*. After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.

I think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.

My mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four – the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family’s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I’m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they’re twenty-seven*, he’d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.

I think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.

I wasn’t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn’t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira’s funeral. She’d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.

It’s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday – twenty-five – was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.

*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*

Twenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming – it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.

I must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn’t want anything getting through from the outside world – god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.

Falling off the face of the earth didn’t matter much, anyway – I didn’t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.

The night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I’ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it’s only been getting worse – more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I’ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.

I got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow – today, now – is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn’t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn’t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.

That’s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I’d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.

Waiting. Watching. Wordless.

“Leave me… leave me alone,” I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.

The shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn’t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I’d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I’d duct taped there a year ago – a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.

As soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.

My intruders were not a pair of assassins – not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I’d found her dead in years ago, the one she’d picked out for Moira’s funeral. Her head hung parallel to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.

Moira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries – she’d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.

“Why are you here?” I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. “Are you… are you here to take me?”

Joy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.

I whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, “she… she tried.” Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.

“What do you mean, Joy?” I pleaded.

Her lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.

The incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira’s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until – finally – it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o’clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.

I was born at 9:26 AM – once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live… if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I’d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters’.

My plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn’t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira’s knocking just moments before.

It easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. “What do you want?” I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.

The reply came from an unfamiliar man’s voice. “I just have a letter for you, miss.”

“Just… just slide it under the door, and please leave,” I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.

He deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn’t received one in years.

Bright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you’re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn’t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn’t even get my birthday right. I didn’t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.

*Laura,*

*If you’re reading this, your father has killed me. Don’t believe a thing he or the police say – I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*

*The truth is… I died is because I found the truth behind my family’s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift – a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*

*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It’s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you’ve always been a strong girl.*

*I hope you’ve made it this far, but at the same time… I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do – especially not your father.*

*Happy birthday – I love you.*

*Mom*

I closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister – mom had tried to warn them, but they didn’t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place… my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.

At the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I’ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.

I need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all. I’m planning on surprising my father with a visit [for my birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

nosleep,My husband insists on keeping this one painting of a woman,"When my husband and I first got married and moved in together, we had a few fights. On personal space, on chores… and on décor.

Namely, my husband insisted on keeping this weird painting of a woman.

“Who is she?” I’d asked when I first saw it, leaned against a mountain of moving boxes.

“Dunno. Got it at a rummage sale.”

It was an original painting. Oil, I think, judging by the way the light reflected off the brushstrokes. It depicted a young woman standing in a dark room, looking over her shoulder at the viewer. She was actually rather beautiful. Blonde hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. A white cotton dress. A dainty, heart-shaped face that was somehow haunting rather than cute.

She was illuminated brightly, but the room behind her was dark. The contrast and her pose reminded me a little bit of *Girl With A Pearl Earring*. But it didn’t feel classy, or pensive, or beautiful. Instead it felt… creepy.

Especially because my husband insisted on hanging it above our bed.

“I mean, it’s a beautiful painting,” I said. “But it just doesn’t fit with the modern décor.”

“Neither do your Funko Pops.”

“Okay, but they’re small. This painting is *enormous.* For Pete’s sake, the woman is nearly life-sized!”

“I want to keep her where she is.”

It seemed like a big deal to him, so I dropped it. But it wasn’t easy. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible feeling that I was being watched. Then I’d look up and see her haunting gray eyes staring down at me.

I didn’t get much sleep after that.

And there was the one time I swear she moved. “Was her hand always like that?” I asked Eric, after getting into bed one night.

“Hmm?”

“Her left hand. The fingers are kind of open, reaching out behind her. Like she’s waiting for someone to grab her hand.”

“Yeah, she was always like that.”

I could’ve sworn she *wasn’t* always like that. Then again, I generally avoided looking at the painting. It was so uncomfortably realistic. When I stared into those gray eyes, I almost felt like I was making eye contact with a person.

I lasted two weeks. Then I begged Eric to move it.

“Can we *please* move the painting somewhere else? I really hate looking at it when I’m going to sleep.”

“It’s the nicest piece of art we have. It belongs above the bed.”

“What about the sunflower one?”

“That’s just a print,” he complained. “And it’s so basic.”

“Come on. I’ll move my Funko Pops out if you move the painting out.”

He heaved a long sigh. “Fine. I’ll move her.”

That was another thing. He often referred to the painting as “her.” It was weird.

So he moved it to the stairs. But honestly, that was worse. Every time I went downstairs, there she was. Staring at me from above the landing with those piercing gray eyes. At least when the painting was in the bedroom, I was usually asleep or facing the opposite direction.

I hit my breaking point a few days after that.

For some reason I couldn’t sleep. After tossing and turning for an hour, I decided to grab a snack downstairs. I got to the top of the stairs… and there she was.

I hadn’t turned on the main lights—only the nightlight in the hall bathroom was on. With everything so dark, the background of the painting melted into the shadows. But the woman still stood out, with her pale face and white dress.

And my stupid, sleepy brain interpreted it as an actual person standing there.

I jumped about a foot in the air. And I would’ve fallen all the way down the stairs, had I not caught the banister at the last second.

“Can we pleeeease get rid of that painting?” I asked the next morning.

Eric turned away from the stove, set the spatula down. “Why?”

“Last night, it scared the frick out of me. I nearly fell down the stairs.”

He stared at me, as if unable to understand. “She… scared you?” he asked slowly.

“Well, more like startled me. I thought it was actually a person standing there.”

He looked at me.

Then he broke into laughter. And, after a few seconds, I started laughing too. It *was* pretty stupid, now that I thought about it. I know I was sleepy, but still—I thought the painting was a *person?!* What, did I think we were being burglarized by a young, beautiful, blonde woman in a nightdress?

“For now, I’ll move her into my office. Then you don’t have to look at her at all.”

“That sounds good.”

And for a while after that, things were okay. I sort of noticed Eric spending more time in his office than usual, but he also had a big deadline for a brief coming up. And what, how would that be related to the painting, anyway? It’s not like he was staring at her for hours on end.

Except that’s exactly what I caught him doing.

One night he didn’t come downstairs to eat dinner with me. I called up to him a few times. No reply. So I went upstairs and walked into his office—to find him staring at her.

He was just sitting there. With his computer closed. No papers on the desk. Swivel chair turned towards the woman in the painting.

“Oh,” he said suddenly, when I walked in. Then he quickly stood up. “I was just about to come down. Just sent in the brief a few minutes ago. They’re really happy with it.”

He smiled broadly at me, as if nothing were wrong, and then slipped past me. I listened to his footsteps thump down the stairs.

*Had he actually just finished working?*

*Or was he just sitting in here… staring at her?*

I ultimately decided not to bring it up. The painting was out of my sight and that was great. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry, like my own deadline coming up for an article I hadn’t even started.

But then, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally overheard him on the phone. His voice was muffled through the thick wooden door, but it wasn’t hard to hear him. He was shouting, almost.

*“I’ll have it in by tonight—”*

*“No, I knew it was due on Wednesday—”*

*“Well, my wife fell down the stairs. I had to take her to the hospital.”*

Those words sent a chill through me. I barged in.

“Why are you lying about me falling down the stairs?”

His face paled. He ended the call and turned towards me. “I’m so sorry, Tara. But I needed an excuse. I missed the deadline on that brief, and it’s my job on the line—""

“The brief you told me you finished two days ago?”

He nodded, silently.

I crossed my arms. “Look, Eric, your work is your business. But we’ve spent, like, all of one hour together all week. Because you’ve been locked in here all day, every day. I mean, are you even working? Or are you just sitting in here, staring at *her?*”

His dark eyes locked on mine. And then his voice grew soft. 

“You’re jealous of her.”

“… *What?!”*

“You shouldn’t be, Tara,” he said, stepping towards me. “The painting makes her prettier than she was.”

I froze. Stared at him.

Then I finally found the words. “Are you saying… this is a painting of someone you know?”

“No,” he said slowly. “Sorry, I misspoke. I meant, whoever this is a portrait of, I’m sure it’s a flattering likeness. All portraits are flattering like that.”

I stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Who is this a painting of, Eric?”

“I told you, it’s not—”

“Eric.” I stepped towards him. My legs felt weak, wobbling underneath me. “*Who is this a painting of?!”*

He only shook his head.

\*\*\*

I couldn’t sleep that night.

I know, it sounds silly, being so worked up over a painting. But you have to admit it was weird. He was obsessed with this thing, for whatever reason. *Why didn’t I see the painting when we were dating? Did he hide it away in the basement?* That was the one place I’d never been. Had he built a little shrine down there, painting, candles, the whole nine yards?

The thought of it made me sick.

*Is it an ex-girlfriend? An ex-wife, even, that he never told me about?* Getting a painting commissioned must have cost a fortune. Especially a huge, detailed one like this. I mean, as much as I hated that thing, it was clearly done by someone incredibly gifted. The glint in those piercing gray eyes, the small dimple on her right cheek…

But clearly he wasn’t keeping it to appreciate the artistry.

*He knew her.*

*And whoever she is, he’s obsessed with her.*

And then I got the craziest idea.

I sat up in bed. Slowly, quietly. Turned to Eric. He was fast asleep. Then I slipped out from underneath the covers, grabbed my phone from the nightstand—and tiptoed out of the room.

My bare feet padded softly across the hallway as I made my way towards his office. Then I pushed the heavy wooden door open and stepped inside.

The office was cold—much colder than our bedroom. Goosebumps pricked up my bare arms. But I didn’t waste any time. I reached over, fumbling across the wall, and hit the switch.

The light flicked on.

The blonde woman stared down at me from the wall. Her eyes seemed to follow me as I took Eric’s leather chair and dragged it across the hardwood. Once against the wall, I stepped up onto it.

We were staring at each other, face to face.

I’d never been this close to the painting before. My face inches from hers. This close, I could truly appreciate the detail. Each individual eyelash painstakingly drawn, curving up from its follicle. Threadlike striations of light and dark gray filling her irises. Her skin, so pale and creamy, dotted with the tiniest of pores.

But I wasn’t here to appreciate the artwork.

I lifted my phone—and took a photo.

Then I brought up a reverse image search.

It took a few minutes for me to find the right website and upload the photo. But when the results loaded… I gasped.

I expected maybe one result, if I were lucky. Some sort of facial recognition that would match the painted face to a photo. Or, maybe the artist’s website would come up, and mention who the subject was. But instead—*dozens* of thumbnails filled the page. Of the exact same painting I’d been staring at for weeks.

Fingers trembling, I clicked on the first one. It led to a news article.

**Search Continues for Missing Franklin Art Student**

My heart dropped. Little black dots danced in my vision. I collapsed into the chair behind me, trembling, and began to read.

*Anya Kelsing, 23, went missing after a hike with her boyfriend…*

*The two became separated when they came upon a bear…*

*Her backpack was found roughly a mile from where the sighting occurred, but no trace of Anya was found…*

And the caption under the painting.

*Kelsing is a third-year student at Franklin College, majoring in Fine Arts. She recently completed a self-portrait that was exhibited at Le Coeur (above)*

I clicked on the next article, and the next—but they all said the same thing. Hike, bear, disappearance. All of them showed a photo along with her self-portrait; she looked strikingly identical to her painted likeness. None of them mentioned the boyfriend’s name, but it had to be Eric. The most recent article, from five years ago, was a video clip of her parents begging for her search to continue. Sadly, judging by the news articles, it never did.

I don’t know how long I sat there. All I know is that I was suddenly jolted from my thoughts by a loud *thump* in the hallway.

Footsteps. Coming towards the office.

I shot up. *He can’t find me here.* I glanced around the room, looking for someplace—any place—that I could hide. But it was probably too late. Surely he’d seen the light on, from under the door…

I ducked under the desk just as he stepped into the room.

“Tara?”

I clapped my hand over my mouth, trying to silence my ragged breathing. *He’s going to see the chair out of place. He knows I’m here. He knows…*

“Tara, you in here?”

*Why did I hide? I could’ve just said I came in here because I heard a noise. Needed a pen. Couldn’t sleep. Why the fuck did I hide? Now he’s going to know that I know…*

“Tara?”

*But maybe it’s fine. Maybe the bear got Anya, maybe Eric had nothing to do with it. Isn’t that more likely than Eric being a murderer?*

“There you are.”

I looked up—and screamed.

Eric was crouched there, in front of the desk, staring at me.

“I—I was looking for a pen,” I stuttered, lamely. “I wanted to write down—I remembered I have to pick up groceries tomorrow and I needed to add something…”

He tilted his head, a small smile on his lips. “I don’t think that’s the truth, Tara.”

*Make a break for it.*

I started to lunge out from under the desk. His hand quickly shot out and grabbed my wrist. *Hard.* “You figured out who she is, didn’t you? That’s the only reason you’d be hiding from me.”

I trembled in his grasp. “What did you do to her?” I whispered.

He let out a dry laugh. “So you think I’m a murderer. How nice, that’s the first conclusion you jump to.”

“No—no, I don’t think you’re a murderer.” I swallowed. *Stupid, stupid, stupid. If he killed her, and he knows you know… then you’re dead too.* “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. Just… what happened? They didn’t find a body. Did the bear get her?”

He didn’t reply. Just stared at me, silently, with those cold dark eyes.

“I was jealous,” I continued, desperately, “but now I understand. I wish you’d just told me. To lose someone like that… of course you’d want to keep the painting. It’s all you have left of her.”

“You should have just left it alone,” he said, his tone oddly emotionless. “I’m sorry you had to find out this way.”

I screamed as he lunged for me.

*It’s over.* His hands were clenched tight on my wrists as he dragged me out from under the desk. I pulled back, trying to wrench myself free, but it was no use—

*Thump!*

A loud crash sounded behind us. Eric whipped around, and for a split second—his grip released.

I acted instantly. Pulled free from him and ran, pivoting around the desk and racing towards the door. As I glanced back, I saw Eric, starting after me.

But I also saw what had made the noise.

The painting of Anya had fallen from the wall. It lay askew on the floor, her gray eyes staring emptily upwards.

\*\*\*

I was always a fast runner.

Eric was only halfway down the stairs by the time I was at the bottom. Bursting out into the cold air, I began to scream. He grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back inside, but it was too late. Lights were flicking on. Our neighbor rushed out of his house, dialing 911.

It was over.

The police arrested Eric for assault. And once I told them my story, of his obsession with Anya’s painting, they were able to search our house. And hidden in his office drawer, in a small box, was a pair of gold earrings.

The same earrings Anya wore on the hike that day.

The case is slowly mounting against him. I’m hoping, praying Anya gets justice and that a jury convicts him of her horrible murder.

And would he have done the same to me, if I hadn’t escaped? If Anya’s painting hadn’t fallen off the wall?

There was an explanation, of course. When Eric had moved the painting to his office, he’d mistakenly installed one of the hangers into pure drywall. The weight of the painting had caused it to rip out, and the painting fell.

But sometimes, I think Anya was watching over me. That her self-portrait carried a piece of her. And that night, she’d protected me from falling victim to the monster who ended her life.

The painting now hangs up in my foyer. Every day I walk by it, and new details pop out at me: the deep, shadowy green of the room behind her. A perfectly-painted strand of blonde hair. The glint in her piercing gray eyes.

And sometimes, I think she’s smiling back at me.",Entertainment
nosleep,"My wife has a removable face. I’ve never glimpsed what lies beneath it, but my best friend has.","Samantha told me about it on our third date. We were watching a movie on her couch when I made my move to kiss her. She whipped her hand in front of my face and blocked me.

“There’s something you need to know,” she said.

I braced myself. *Here it comes. “I’m not ready for a relationship. Nothing to do with you, of course.”* It was the absolute last thing that I wanted to hear, because I was already crazy about her.

“Okay,” I said.

“I have a removable face.”

*That’s a new one.* “You have a what now?” I was about to laugh, but she was wearing a deadly serious expression.

“I have a removable face.”

“Is that, like, a metaphor or something?”

“No. My face is literally removable. Look. Closely.” She lifted her chin and traced her jaw line with a finger. “You can see the seam.”

After admiring how beautiful her neck was for a dizzying moment, I leaned in for an inspection. It was very hard to see, but it *did* look like there was a slightly unnatural transition there from her face to her throat. I grew dizzier, as a dozen questions rushed into my brain.

“Don’t bother asking why or how or anything like that,” said Samantha. “I can’t tell you that. If that’s going to be a problem, you should leave now. I’m letting you know this because I like you, and I want to take the next step, but this is non-negotiable.”

“Okay,” I said, unsure of what was happening. “Not a problem. So what? You have a removable face. Who cares? It looks good.”

“There’s something else. Once a day, usually in the evening, I have to remove the face and disinfect the inside of it. If I don’t, it will rot. This takes about an hour, give or take, depending on how my day went. During this time, you must never *ever* look at my real face. *Never*. Do you understand?”

“Y… yes. Got it. Don’t ask about it, don’t look at your… ‘real’ face.”

Samantha stood up. “Now, I’m going to go into the bathroom and clean my face. That will give you plenty of time to think about what I’ve told you. If you’re here when I’m done… that’s great. I would like that. But if you’re gone… I’ll understand.”

She turned and walked into her bedroom. I sat in stunned silence as I heard the bathroom door close.

I gave the thing some serious thought. It was possible that it was a joke of some kind. It was possible that it was a delusion. Was it possible that it was true? Well, it was certainly possible to transform an actor’s face with movie makeup, so I supposed it was possible that Samantha wore a “removable face” every day. Maybe she had had a horrible accident where her flesh had been mangled. Maybe her face had been melted by acid, or burned by fire, or the skin shorn off by heavy machinery. If it had, I would never know, because she would never tell me, and I would never see it.

I pictured a face of raw, naked muscle, rotting away. Could I kiss her, if that was what I was kissing? But wasn’t that what we all were, under the skin? Just muscle and bone and blood and squishy organs.

I paced around the living room, running my hand through my hair. I liked Samantha, a lot. She was smart, and funny… and beautiful. But was that beauty *real*? Did it count? Did it matter if it was “real” or not? Was I being superficial even worrying about it?

When she came out of the bathroom, I was still there. I looked at her face. She smiled and I was in love.

\*

We dated, we moved in together, we decided to get married.

For the most part, it was a completely normal relationship, typical of two young people in love, building a life together. During the day, it was easy to forget about the face altogether. It looked natural enough, and only in certain positions, in certain lights, was there ever any indication that it *wasn’t* natural.

But every night was the same. Samantha would close herself in the bathroom – sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two – and clean the inside of her face. The curiosity never left me. I would sit there and wonder what was under that face. I came so close to barging in on her a few times, but I never did.

I *did* occasionally ask her about it. About what, if anything, had happened. About how it was possible to make the removable face look so real. About what it really looked like underneath. I tried to coax her into showing me, assuring her that I loved her no matter what, and didn’t give a damn what her real face looked like… I was just curious, that’s all.

She never showed me, or told me the story behind it. She didn’t get upset at me (unless I was really badgering her.) She’d just shrug and say, “You know you can’t see it. You know I can’t tell you about it.”

\*

I never told anybody about Samantha’s removable face. It’s not that she asked me not to. I just didn’t think it was anybody’s business.

Except once, I did tell somebody.

It was during my bachelor’s party. We had rented several cabins in Big Sur and spent the night drinking and packing our noses with powders that we shouldn’t have been packing our noses with. Everyone else had passed out and the sun was creeping up behind us as I stood on the majestic cliffs with my friend Chris, looking down on the pacific waves crashing against the rocks.

Chris was my best friend; as close to a brother as I’d known. We’d grown up together, and visited each other at college often, and spent the summers together. After college, we’d moved to different cities, but we stayed in close contact.

Standing there on the cliffs, I told Chris about Samantha’s removable face. At first, he thought I was joking. Then he had a thousand questions, most of which I couldn’t answer.

“What’s underneath?”

“I don’t know, man. I don’t know.”

“Doesn’t that drive you crazy, not knowing?”

I shrugged. “Lots of stuff I don’t know. Don’t know how to do calculus, and I don’t know what happens when we die.”

“But dude, she’s about to be your *wife*. And you don’t even know what she *looks like*. I mean, I’d have to take a look. Like, you could set a camera up in the bathroom. That’s where she does it, right? Set up a camera and have a look and then you’ll know.”

I sighed. “Yeah, it drives me crazy. I’ve asked her a million times. But she told me I could never look. Gotta respect that, man, even if I don’t like it. That’s love.”

Chris laughed. “*You* telling *me* to respect a woman? Up is down now.”

Then we fell back into talking about old times as a new day dawned.

\*

Chris was in town for business last week, and planned on spending the weekend at our house. The conversation at Big Sur had happened four years ago, and we hadn’t spoken about Samantha’s removable face since, despite keeping in close contact and seeing each other as often as two people transforming into adults in different parts of the country can.

It happened on Saturday evening. We were lounging lazily in the backyard, deep into the beer, having just finished with some grilled steaks, when I got a text from work.

“Goddammit,” I groaned. “I have to make a work call.”

“Seriously?” said Samantha, raising an artificial eyebrow. “On a Saturday night?”

“My biggest client, baby. Sorry.”

“It is what it is, I guess,” said my wife. “I’m going to head inside and get cleaned up. Chris? Are you okay just hanging out for a bit?”

Chris smiled. “I'll be fine. Got my beer, got some weeds to pull in your garden. God knows your lazy-ass husband isn’t going to do it. Those tomatoes are choking to death. It’s a tragedy.”

I rolled my eyes and went into the side yard to make my call.

15 minutes into it, I heard the screams coming from inside. Both my best friend and my wife were wailing in terror.

I dropped the phone and ran into the house and down the hall to our bedroom. Through the open door, I could see that the door to the master bathroom was also standing open.

“Don’t come in!” screamed Samantha. “I don’t have my face on! Call an ambulance! He looked! Oh God, he looked!” She sounded desperate, and truly horrified. That made me desperate and horrified, and I wanted to rush into the bathroom, but I knew suddenly that that would be a mistake.

I knew suddenly that Samantha didn’t want me to look at her real face not out of a sense of vanity, but for my own safety.

Chris staggered backwards, out of the bathroom. He was holding a straightened out paperclip, which he had used to pick the privacy lock. Now he was stabbing it again and again into his eyes, shouting gibberish. He was clearly in the depths of madness, and it turned my stomach to see him mutilate himself.

“Call a fucking ambulance!” my wife screamed. “Don’t come in here! He fucking LOOKED!”

I turned and ran back to the side yard, where my phone was lying in the newly mowed grass. My client was still on the line, alarmed, asking what was happening, what all the screaming was. I hung up on him and called 911.

When the paramedics arrived, Chris was having a seizure in the hallway. Samantha was stroking his head, sobbing. Her face was on, but it had been done hastily, and everything looked a little off.

\*

My world has been dark this past week.

My best friend is in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. He’s completely blind and mostly catatonic, except when he slips into a violent, babbling mania. The doctors are optimistic that his state is temporary, but they don’t know the truth about what caused it, because I told the paramedics that Chris had taken a large dose of psychedelic mushrooms and fallen into psychosis.

I saw no good reason to tell the truth about what had happened. Who would believe that one look at my wife’s “real” face would make somebody insane? At best, we would be the subjects of a long investigation; at worst, we would have to prove that what we were saying was true, by showing somebody Samantha’s face. Then the same thing would happen again, and what after that? I had no idea, and no interest in finding out. For Samantha’s part, I knew that she would never consent to show anybody her real face, no matter what the consequences of refusal were.

I did get a follow-up call from the police, asking me to confirm my story. The hospital found no traces of psilocybin in Chris’ blood, though that’s not unheard of, since it has a short half-life. If they end up testing his hair, I will likely be in a lot of trouble. But that’s truly the least of my concerns.

Samantha is in a state of her own. She still cleans the inside of her face, though not as regularly, and when she puts it back on, it’s always crooked now. It is beginning to smell a little bit.

I’ve tried to assure her that it wasn’t her fault. “He *knew*,” I said. “I told him that nobody was ever allowed to look at it. He *knew* and then he *broke into the bathroom.* This is not on you, baby. Please. Talk to me.”

“Not on me? That one look at my fucking *face* makes people insane? Please. I just need some time alone.”

As for me, I am doing my best to hold it together. Do you know what’s strange, though? Despite what happened to Chris, I still find myself curious about what my wife’s real face looks like. More curious than ever, really.",Entertainment
nosleep,"I work security at Disney World... well, I mean I did.","I work in security at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth. Typically, I wouldn’t say where I work as obviously there are some pretty strict rules about things employees can put online, but I just don’t think I can tell this properly without that context. And, honestly, I think this may be it for me anyway with this job. I just can’t see myself working here any longer now. 

I’ve been with the company for 23 years. The first 20 years I worked in the parks – nabbing shoplifters and rounding up people who were drinking too much for the heat. Occasionally there’d be a fight to break up, but people usually kept it pretty mild. 

The heat and walking was getting too much for me the last few years so I asked to be transferred somewhere with a/c and the company moved me to one of their resorts. While the working conditions were 110&#37; better as far as climate and comfort go, the guest issues were trickier \- mainly domestics. I guess the expensive and stress of vacation got to a lot of people and I’d be called by neighboring rooms because some mom and dad were yelling at each other. I’d try to suggest they take a nap or go do separate activities for a bit and that would usually calm them down.

But none of that is what I’m here for. I’ve got to get this out while I have time.

Three days ago I got a call from management. Apparently a couple of days before that, housekeeping had went into a room that should’ve been turned over that day (turned over is when one guest leaves by about 11:00 a.m. and the next guest checks in around 3:00 p.m.) and all of the guests’ items were still in the room. Housekeeping made a note of it and moved on, but during the next two days when they entered the room, everything was still there and untouched.

I went to check it out and sure enough there was an empty room full of luggage, clothes, snacks, some toys, everything a family would need for vacation. The manager had already looked up the previous reservation and it was for a family – dad, mom, two little kids. I tried to call the phone numbers they had given but all I got was voice mail. We were a bit stumped so I made the call that housekeeper could clean the room and take the family’s personal items to be held until we got in contact with someone.

I went digging into the reservation more. The family had arrived five days before housekeeping discovered all of their stuff.  I found that the family had paid a parking fee and their vehicle description was listed. A quick walk of the parking lots and I had easily located their vehicle. So that ruled out a car accident or them deciding to just leave all their stuff behind. 

Next, I saw that they had bought a dining plan. This is when a guest prepays for all of their food. They’re given a certain number of “credits” to use for meals. This family had only used 3 credits and the last one was two days after they checked in. It appeared that the day they arrived, they got here late and probably just stayed on the resort. The next day they used 2 credits at Epcot. The second park day they used just 1 credit at Magic Kingdom and it was at breakfast time. 

Now at Disney we have something called Magic Bands. Magic Bands are worn by the guests and act as a room key, park ticket, credit card, dining reservation payment, fastpass (a system used to bypass lines), and more. It took some work, but I was finally able to look up this family’s fastpass history. The day they went to Magic Kingdom, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the park, rode a couple of rides, and then rode their last ride, It’s a Small World around 11:00 a.m. Then nothing.

Finally, it was time to bring in someone else on this. I called an old co\-worker at Magic Kingdom and asked him to pull security footage for It’s a Small World at the time they rode it and I made my way over there. When I got there, my friend was very confused, almost distraught, looking. He showed me what he found. There’s usually a camera in the direction of where rides load and unload. The footage showed them scanning their bands to use fastpasses for the ride and boarding the ride. The footage from the exit of the ride just showed the other people in their car exiting. They weren’t there.

Of course we thought the worse, maybe one of the kids had fallen out and mom and dad and the other kid got off in the middle of the ride to help and they all got injured or killed or stuck in machinery somewhere. So we shut down the ride. Middle of the damn day. Turned off that ear worm music and turned up the lights. Me and my buddy walked that ride three times before we called in help. Eventually there was close to ten cast members searching, and we didn’t find shit except for three cell phones and a hat.

I was right stumped. I've kept digging the past couple of days, and I’m not sure who to tell what I found next to. I’ve called the police and I suppose they’re on the way, but the company has a way of covering up things like this and I decided I can’t live with myself if I don’t put out some type of warning.

I kept digging into their reservation over the last couple of days and today I noticed they had purchased memory maker. There are photographers all over the parks and cameras in a lot of the rides and, with memory maker, the photos are all free. They automatically get added to a guest’s Disney account when the system knows their picture has been taken. And the system always knows. Everyone’s whereabouts are always known with the Magic Bands.

Well, I opened up their memory maker photo album and, I swear, there’s 732 pictures. The first 30 or so are pretty normal. Epcot, a few rides, in front of the castle. But the rest. The rest are all in It’s a Small World. The rides only take one picture per go around. So it appears as though this family has ridden this ride over 700 times. The first picture was pretty normal. Everyone looked happy, it was busy day and a full car of guests.  The next one is rough to look at. The car is empty except for this little family and they look so darn confused. The next 10\-15 I can see dad getting angry, yelling. Mom is holding onto those two kids like her life depends on it and you can see the kids getting increasingly upset, crying. And it goes on, and on, and on. After 50 or so it looks like they’re trying to get out. In one the dad is missing. In another they’re all gone.  Maybe like they’ve bailed early in the ride and tried to walk out, but in the very next one, they’re all right back in that damn car. After around 450 or so, I only see the mom and kids. It’s just when I look closely I can see dad, maybe just his body now, slumped down in one of the other seats. Since about 675, there’s just mom and one kid. Another body in another seat.  The mom and kid aren’t moving anymore. I think them two are still alive, just damn near catatonic. Looking straight ahead, pale.  

And, y’all, I swear on my fucking life, the dolls are moving or something. In some of these pictures I can tell they aren’t where they should be. I even saw one with a doll in the car with this family.

I can’t look anymore or I’m going to lose my lunch. I closed the album. It’s file sized has increased since I closed it. God, are there new pictures being added? 

I see on security cameras that the local PD just arrived so they’ll take over soon. I wish I knew what the fuck is going on, but I also wish this damn thing had never landed in my lap. I don’t think I’ll be able to update this. After I talk to the police, I think I’m going to walk out of here and never come back. I just wanted to get this out there, before Disney feeds the media some bullshit cover up as to why a whole family vanished. They didn’t vanish. I know where they are.",Entertainment
nosleep,My Sleep Paralysis Demon is Actually A Pretty Chill Guy,"My first memory of sleep paralysis happened when I was ten years old. I remember because it was the night my parents took me to see Shrek 2 for getting good marks on my report card. It was an evening show, so we got in late and my mom tucked me straight into bed when we got home.

It was around four am when I woke up, the light from my alarm clock told me that much. I couldn't feel anything, not my pajamas against my skin, or the warmth of my head against the pillow. I could feel my arms and legs, but they felt heavy, as if a great weight was holding them down. 

I tried to call out but I couldn’t, my voice caught in my throat, my lips unable to move. I mustered a weak groan that sounded like a cross between a frog’s croak and a zombie’s moan, but that was it. 

I thought I was dead, that this is what death feels like, being awake but unable to move or tell anyone. My mind wrestled with the idea of being placed in a coffin, unable to tell anyone I was still alive in here, unable to move or say anything as the lid closed and they put me in the ground, still alive.

My fear subsided as I felt my heart thudding in my chest in response to my near panic attack. I also became aware of my breathing, which slowed as the fear subsided. I calmed a little, thinking it was just a dream.

That was when I saw him for the first time. Mr. BrownStickLegs.

He huddled in the corner of the room by my closet. His two oversized red eyes glowed in the dark of my bedroom. His face was like a porcelain mask, white, expressionless, with no mouth or nose, only those two haunting red eyes. 

When he stood up, his body unfolded like origami until his head reached the ceiling. His neck bent, tilting forward as his true height was greater than the height of my room. His long black torso was covered in shimmering symbols that reflected red in the light of his glowing eyes. He stood on two spindly thin legs that disappeared into the shadows of the room. 

He made no noise as he moved, seeming to glide as he hovered closer to my bed. His long thin arms reached down to me as I moaned through paralyzed lips. I could not scream, even though I very much wanted to.

His fingers reaching through the darkness, down to my face. Two pointed fingers touched against my eyelids, pushing them closed. I remember his fingertips feeling cool, but not cold. Even though the ends of his fingertips looked sharp, his touch was gentle.

“Do not struggle, little one. Sleep, sleep,” he said. His voice was so deep I could feel it in my chest when he spoke.

I did as instructed, convincing myself that it indeed was a dream. Even if it wasn’t, the back of my eyelids was more reassuring than looking into those piercing red eyes in his vacant mask of a face. I closed my eyes, wanting it to be a dream, willing it to be a dream. I woke up the next morning, thankfully able to move, walk and talk.

I explained what I saw to my parents, who both agreed that it was a dream. My mom tried floating the idea that something from Shrek 2 scared me but neither my dad or I bought it. For confirmation, dad asked that I draw a picture of what I saw for them. As I was drawing, I ran out of black crayon and had to finish his legs with the next darkest color in my crayon box. 

“Hey there, Mister BrownStickLegs,” my Dad said as I handed him the drawing. “You leave my daughter alone now, you hear?”

This is how my sleep paralysis demon ended up with the name Mr. BrownStickLegs. 

Giving him a silly name helped take some of the edge off of going to bed the following night. My dad even did a sweep of the room, calling out for him. “Here Mr. BrownStickLegs,” he said, whistling as if he were calling a dog. It made me giggle and the whole episode felt more fun than scary.

But once they tucked me in and turned off the light, I felt the dread creeping back in. Darkness hits harder when you expect to find something lurking in the shadows. I don’t know how long I searched, but I eventually fell asleep.

In the weeks following, I searched for Mr. BrownStickLegs every night as I fell asleep. Even when I went to sleepovers I would do a cursory check in case he tagged along to a friends house. As time passed, my searches became less frequent. 

It was a couple months later, the night before my first day of 5th grade when I woke up to Mr. BrownStickLegs straddled over my bed, his empty plate of a face inches from my own.

A scream stuck in my throat, coming out sounding like a gush of air releasing from a pool float.

“Hush, child,” he said. His voice was deep, echoless. I didn’t know how he spoke without a mouth, but I heard him nonetheless.

I saw that he held a piece of paper in his thin fingers, crumpled on the edges and torn. He held it up to show me.

On the page was a pink blob with blue dots for eyes and a droll red smile and stick lines for legs and arms. It was lying on a blue rectangle.

“I found the picture you drew of me. So I drew a picture of you,” he said. “Do you like it?”

I tried nodding, but I couldn’t move. I tried answering, but all that came out was the same dry croaking sound. 

“Will you draw another one for me? I so liked the first one, you gave me pants. I look good in pants.”

Again, I was unable to respond or move to give him an answer. He must’ve been able to read my intent, because he tucked the picture under my pillow before closing my eyes again. 

When I woke up in the morning, I bolted upright and tossed my pillow off the bed. My heart leapt into my throat when I found the picture. It wasn’t a dream. He was real. 

I went to my desk and began drawing a picture for him, starting with his face and eyes, trying to capture as much detail as I could remember. I had forgotten all about the first day of school until my mom opened my door and found me still in my pajamas.

“Lexi!” she yelled, startling me as I was coloring in his eyes. “Your bus will be here in less than an hour, get dressed NOW!”

I tucked my picture into my school backpack and got dressed. 

I finished my drawing at recess that day, using my brand new Crayola 64 pack that I got with my back to school supplies. I gave him blue pants this time, figuring he’d like to see himself in jeans. I wrote his name, “Mr. BrownStickLegs” at the bottom of the picture and drew a smileyface next to it, hoping he’d like his nickname. 

I flipped the paper over to write him a message on the back. I wanted to ask him questions, but didn’t want to anger him since he visited me when I was at my most vulnerable. I wrote out my letter on a separate piece of paper before copying it over to the back of my picture.

*Dear Mr. BrownStickLegs (that’s your name),*

*My name is Lexi. I am in the fifth grade. What is your name? How old are you? Do you go to school? Why do you visit my bedroom? Why can’t I move when you visit? You look scary but you also seem nice. I hope we can be friends.*

*Love,*  
*Lexi*

*P.S. I hope you like your blue pants!*

I added another smileyface at the end of the letter, my final emphasis on wanting to be friends. I considered closing with Sincerely, but I figured Love was a better, friendlier choice.

I tucked the picture under my pillow that night, now anxious to see him rather than filled with dread of his reappearance. But like the last time, he did not return the next day. Or the day after. The days stretched into weeks, and every morning I found the picture tucked under my pillow from the night before. 

It wasn’t until Thanksgiving break that I saw him again. My eyes opened as the morning sun poked through the blinds of my bedroom. His body didn’t look any different in the light; in fact, his black skin seemed darker, absorbing the sun’s rays without giving anything back. His eyes seemed wider than before; if he had a mouth I would have figured he was smiling. In his slender fingers was the picture I drew for him.

“Hello Lexi,” he said. “Thank you for the picture, I do look good in blue pants.”

I wanted to smile, but, well, sleep paralysis.

He flipped the picture over to the side with my letter.

“I will answer your questions the best I can. I do not have a name, not one you could ever pronounce, but I am happy for you to call me Mr. BrownStickLegs. As for my age, I exist outside of the construct of time, therefore I am ageless. I do not go to school, nor do I know what school is. Why do I visit you? I visit to feed on the energy of your soul.”

My breath quickened as a mute groan exited my teeth. I wanted to run, wanted to get away from him, but I was pinned down, unable to move.

He sensed my uneasiness and tried to calm me by patting my forehead.

“Let me explain. Have you been to the ocean? It appears vast, almost limitless as you stare out into the blue water, with no visible land on the other side?”

In my mind I was standing on a beach. I felt the salty ocean breeze against my face as I looked out over the massive body of water. The waves crashed at my feet. I felt the rush of water over them followed by the trickle of sand and pebbles as the water drew back.

“Your soul is like an ocean, child. Vast, limitless, undefinable by words to your understanding. I take only a tiny sip, a single glass of water from a vast ocean. I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.”

Dark clouds formed over the water as I stared at the whitecapped waves. The clouds unleashed a heavy downpour, turning the horizon grey as rain fell from the sky over the ocean.

“Just as the rain falls over the ocean, your soul can replenish itself by more than I could ever consume, not even in a thousand of your years. Does that make you feel better?”

On the beach in my mind’s vision, I nodded. In my bedroom, he nodded back at me.

“Good. As for your last question, why you cannot move, we are meeting at a point outside of your time, where your world and mine touch. Your physical body cannot move here but if you persist you can learn to speak to me with your mind, and I will answer your questions in exchange for your drawings. You can draw pictures of whatever you like, I want to know more of your world.”

In my mind, I nodded again.

“This knowledge is a gift so we can understand one another more. I am not one who would hurt you.”

He pressed his fingertips to my eyelids again, closing them. In my mind’s eye, I was still on the beach, but the sun was setting, and no stars were visible through the rain. I drifted back to sleep to the sound of falling rain.

The next morning I asked my parents for a sketchbook and colored pencils. They tried to hold me off until Christmas, but since I spent most of my afternoons and weekends drawing pictures up in my room, Dad let me open one of my gifts a week early, a Strathmore sketchbook with 100 pages with a 50 pack of Crayola colored pencils. 

I started by drawing the rest of my family, Mom, Dad, my little brother Tommy, our cat Libby, and even though he had died, our dog Pancakes. Next I drew our house, then our car, then my school. I kept drawing anything I could think of, trees, birds, insects, until my sketchbook was full. I used my allowance to purchase more books so I could keep drawing. I honed my craft, redoing my earlier drawings in greater detail.

My thoughts considered his wording, “I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.” I wanted to ask him if there were those who could, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know such things.

Mr. BrownStickLegs didn’t return until my Freshman year of high school. To him, it wasn’t like any time had passed.

I read up on lucid dreaming in the time between visits so that when he returned I would be better capable of talking to him. He held my book in his hands, flipping through my drawings, doting over the increased refinement of my drawing skills. I had filled a dozen sketchpads and upgraded from Crayola to Prismacolor Premier pencils for my drawings. 

His biggest surprise was when after he complimented my drawings I spoke to him.

“Thank you.” I said, seeing the words in my mind as I spoke them aloud.

If he had a surprised expression, his eyes showed it.

“You have been very busy, child,” he said. “Do you have any questions you would like to ask?”

I hesitated, but finally formed the words in my mind. “Are there creatures who can consume an entire ocean?”

He didn’t respond right away, which made me think I had not asked properly. As I asked him a second time, he put a finger to my lips as if to shush me.

“There are those who can. They are known as the Dark Ones. They are capable of consuming entire souls, emptying them out, leaving them dry and barren. You should not fear them, but you should also not provoke them.”

His eyes curved downward, as if concerned or afraid.

“What do they look like?” I asked.

In my mind, my visions were filled with images of great, terrible creatures. Spiders taller than the Empire State Building on thin spindly legs of shadow and smoke. Tentacled monsters in the seas lofting blue whales like they were toys, ripping them to shreds with their curved chitinous beaks. Great, gastly flying creatures that knocked over orchards and forests with the beat of their leathery wings. 

“I showed you only because you ask,” Mr. BrownStickLegs said, “but it is best that we don’t talk or think about them. Let them be.”

I nodded in my mind.

He leaned forward and pressed his plate like face to my head as if to kiss me on the forehead, which was odd since he didn’t have a mouth. Then, as usual, he closed my eyes and I drifted back to sleep.

My life took a downturn during the latter years of high school. My Dad lost his job, and when the search for a new one dragged on, he turned to drinking to cope with his failure. He wasn’t abusive, but he wasn’t fun to be around either. 

In the months following, my parents would hush their arguing when I entered the room, greeting me with smiles as if nothing were wrong. That lasted until the day I came home from school to them fighting over a foreclosure notice from the bank. We moved out over a weekend from our home in the suburbs to an apartment on the other side of town.

I internalized my feelings during that time. I withdrew from my friends and school activities besides the art club, the only one we could still afford. I saw my friends driving to school and hanging out while I rode the bus, too poor and too far out of the way to join in. 

My tastes began to change as well. Out was the bubblegum pop of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Taylor Swift. Instead I listened to Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, and Bring Me The Horizon. My clothes and makeup became darker, more black t-shirts and skirts with black eyeliner and black fingernail polish. Mom called it my goth phase, not that she understood.

My drawings became darker too. I moved from colored pencils to charcoal, drawing skulls and gothic looking cemeteries as my passion for drawing animals and flowers waned. 

I also drew the Dark Ones, in great detail, exactly how I remembered them in my mind’s eye.

Mr. BrownStickLegs visited me again a month after we moved into the apartment. He looked more at home in my room of black light posters and deathmetal bands than he did in my previous room. His eyes were dim, not the vibrant red as they were before.

He stared at me as I lay in bed, unable to move. He moved inches from my face as I heard his words in my mind.

“Your soul tastes different now.”

He didn’t speak of my drawings. I worried that he might, especially since I had been drawing the Dark Ones. Not only drawing them, but thinking about them, and what type of damage they could do if they were to wake.

He seemed sad for me, although reading his expression was difficult with no face. He patted my forehead like before, but didn’t close my eyes before leaving as he used to.

My life continued its spiraling path like a bottle rocket with a broken stick. My parents didn’t talk outside of short conversations about which bills to pay and which ones to ignore. Each night, Dad disappeared into a bottle while Mom disappeared online to chat with a male Facebook friend she knew from high school. 

The thing about rock bottom is that it’s often a disguise for a trap door that drops you to an even lower depth than you thought possible.

The first bottom came when my father died. Drove off the road into a gravel pit late at night with an empty bottle of bourbon in the passenger seat. I cried, but it felt hollow. I felt hollow. Even when mom tried to hold me, I felt nothing inside, not sadness, not guilt, not anything.

I disappeared into my sketchbooks, drawing even darker, more disturbing images. Death, dismemberment, vividly accurate vivasections of the cute animals I used to enjoy drawing. My friends no longer talked to me, which was fine because I didn’t want to talk to them anymore anyways. I found people to hang out with, not friends, but people who could get me access to moments of chemical induced euphoria to forget about life for a while.

Just like that, the trap door opened, dropping me to a new rock bottom of addiction. One thing I had that in common with my dad, but instead of falling into a bottle, I fell into a needle. I stole money from my Mom’s purse to feed my habits, not that she noticed. She was busy with her old Facebook friend who had moved from online acquaintance to nightly sleepover companion.   When the time came to begin my senior year I didn’t bother going back. 

 I kept drawing, filling entire sketchbooks with the dark images that reflected my bleak outlook on life. The Dark Ones were prevalent subjects during this period of my life. I drew them feasting on humanity, raking flesh from bone in their jagged teeth behind lips of smoke.

I came home one night to find my mom and her new male friend in the middle of a fight. It was different from her fights with dad, more violent, more physical. When he raised his hand at me for trying to intervene, I decided it was time to bolt. 

I left home, hitching rides with anyone with a set of wheels I could manage to put up with for short periods of time. My preference leaned toward those with access to the chemical release I craved. The more I could numb, the more I could escape. 

I found certain drug combinations had similar effects to sleep paralysis, where my mind’s ability to control my body’s action became severed. In those moments of numbed paralysis I’d see Mr. BrownStickLegs watching from afar as I dulled the pain. I saw what I perceived as the Dark Ones too, but they weren’t hiding in the shadows like Mr. BrownStickLegs did. 

They were the shadows. 

I called out to them as well, for in those moments I wanted nothing more than to be hollowed out and empty, a void so dark no pain could ever penetrate it. When they didn’t answer, I called out to Mr. BrownStickLegs, but he would vanish every time. Perhaps it was all just a drug fueled hallucination.

Overdosing was never my intention. I was pushing too much, trying to find the edge of the void after feeling so low, so very low, searching for that something extra to filter out the background noise. I took it too far, giving myself a near-lethal dose. At one moment, I was lying next to strangers on a stained mattress in an abandoned warehouse. Then came the initial rush of euphoric bliss. And then, nothing.

Whoever I was traveling with at the time dumped me on the curb in front of the ER, making me someone else’s problem. 

This was my rock bottom moment, although at the time, it felt more like freefall.   

I spent three weeks in a coma. I was aware of my surroundings, and could hear the doctors and nurses as they checked my vitals and tended to my cleanliness and upkeep, but I couldn’t move or speak. 

At the end of my third week in the ICU on an incubator, I looked up to find Mr. BrownStickLegs hovering over me, his round red eyes peering through the darkness.

“What have you done to yourself, child?” his voice spoke inside my mind. 

In my mind, I was beside him, standing in the middle of a vast salt flat desert. The ground was cracked and dry in a hexagonal pattern that stretched in all directions.

“This is your soul now, there is nothing left to drink.”

I heard my beep of my heart rate monitor back in my hospital room speed up as fear entered my mind.

“I called out to the Dark Ones,” I said. “I asked for them to come. They emptied me out, emptied my soul.”

“No, my child. **You** did this. You have not replenished, you have only consumed. And now, nothing remains.”

I dropped to my knees in the middle of the salt as I felt a rumbling deep inside the hollow pit of my stomach. 

I leaned forward onto my arms, but they were no longer my arms. They were pitch black and empty. I could feel them, but when I looked at them, they were empty voids of smoke and shadow. I stood up on my legs, but they were no longer my legs. The darkness swirled up my torso and down my arms. The emptiness inside me consumed my entire body until only my head remained. 

“What’s happening to me?”

I heard a snap as my arms and legs split, forming eight black, spindly thin legs. I collapsed onto them, unable to support myself.

Mr. BrownStickLegs glided down in front of my face, his eyes inches from my own.

“As I told you, child, only the Dark Ones have the ability to consume an entire ocean of a soul. That is your fate. That is what you will become.”

Back in the room, my heart rate monitor crashed to a flatline. I felt the cold darkness swirl up my neck to my head as the void consumed me. I was aware of the nurses and doctors huddled around my body, prepping the crash cart, but all I felt was the cold consuming what was left of me.

“Help me,” I uttered. “Please.”

My physical body jolted from the electric paddles, but I felt nothing. Only the cold darkness. A needle injected into my IV line as they recharged for another burst of electricity. Still I felt nothing. Only cold, only darkness, only the vast emptiness of the void.

Mr. BrownStickLegs tilted his head as he stared through his unblinking red eyes. He leaned forward, pressing his plate like face to my forehead. I felt a vibration against my skin, followed by the tingling sensation of heat returning. The darkness receded back down my arms and legs. 

As he pulled back, the red in his eyes had diminished.

“A gift, for the girl who gave me pants.”

A tear formed in my eye. It rolled down my cheek and fell onto the parched landscape below. Before I could say anything, an electronic jolt coursed through my body, pulling me away from the salt flat expanse and back to my hospital room.

The sinus rhythm of my heart rate monitor returned to normal. I felt the cool gel of the defibrillator paddles against my chest. I remember squeezing the hand of one of the attending nurses, who smiled down at me.

“Look who’s awake.”

I cried, but it was different than before. I felt the pain I had long been avoiding, but I felt something else as well. I felt grateful, and I felt a sense of hope I hadn’t known in a long time.

It was a long road back from the darkness, but the thing about the road to recovery is that, like a road, it leads to a destination. After years of listless drifting towards the void, having a destination was an important first step in finding self-love.

I reconnected with my mother, who was struggling with her own form of the darkness. We leaned on one another, talking and going to therapy as we worked through the issues that drove us apart. After my release from the hospital I moved back home with her, her Facebook friend long gone. I got my GED and used my many sketchbooks as a portfolio to get an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor.

I've been clean for four years now, and it feels good to smile again. Granted, I still prefer Pierce the Veil to anything from Katy Perry’s catalogue, and my tattoos and jewelry have more skulls than fluffy bunnies, but that's all on the surface. I no longer crave the darkness to consume me. 

I often think about the vision with Mr. BrownStickLegs on the salt flats that night in the hospital. I had not seen him since that night, and I often wonder about the state of my soul since that day. Has it replenished or is it still the dried up barren wasteland that he took me to on the night? 

Last night, around three in the morning, I finally got my answer.

I woke up with a heaviness on my chest, arms and legs. At first I felt the grips of fear grabbing hold, much like the first time I experienced it. But then in the dark corner of my room, I saw glowing red eyes staring back at me from the shadows.

In spite of my sleep paralysis, couldn’t help but smile when I heard his voice call out to me.

nosleep,"My sister discovered a universal language, but she hasn't spoken a word since 2003","My sister is a genius. When she was about thirteen she made this device that honestly still blows my mind. I’ve spent my entire life studying physics and I still don’t know what she did, or how—which is probably for the best considering how this all played out. I don’t know how she did it, but what I do know is in the summer of 2003 the laws governing matter and atomic mass didn’t seem to affect her anymore, she was invisible to the human eye, and she was speaking a universal language we’ve never been able to identify or reproduce.

Before I get into this, though, have you ever seen Firefly?

Allow me to quote:

*I am very smart.*

*I went to the best medic-ed in Osiris, top 3% of my class; finished my internship in eight months. ‘Gifted’ is the term.*

*So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child, I want you to understand my full meaning.*

This could have been written about me and my sisters. We come from a long line of gifted people. My father is a neurologist, my mother works for SpaceX, and my eldest sister is an artist whose work has been featured in galleries since she was twelve. I’m a full-time research associate of high energy density physics at a university I can’t name without risking my career. And, like Simon Tam from Firefly before me, I don’t tell you all of this to flaunt our intelligence or to make us look special. I tell you this so you can fully understand what I mean when I say Nirali made us *all* look like idiot children.

In 2003 I was about to turn seventeen. My interests weren’t like most teen girls, so I won’t bore you with the details of what I found more entertaining than TV, books, or the mall, but more often than not I was occupied with personal research projects. The first time Nirali made herself invisible I was in the middle of a research rabbit hole. I was deep into some really heady academic articles when I heard Nirali pipe up behind me.

“They’re wrong, you know.”

I groaned inwardly. We’d had the knocking talk, but she was still so bad at respecting boundaries. “Nirali, what did we say about knocking?”

“Oh,” she said, and sounded genuinely surprised. “I didn’t think about the door.”

“What?” I frowned and spun my chair around to look at her.

My room was empty.

*Wait, empty?*

I looked around briefly before rubbing my eyes, wondering when I’d slept last and already writing the conversation off as an auditory hallucination. Shaking my head, I started to turn back to my computer when I heard her giggle.

“Alright, jerkhole. Where are you?”

“Right here,” she giggled, her voice coming from directly in front of me.

“What the—how? Did you hide the speakers again?” I stood up, taking a moment to really look around the room. She’d pulled a prank like this before, hiding a complex set of speakers she’d modified to create a confluence of sound she could manipulate. It would sound like someone was anywhere in the room she specified. She’d even made it sound like she was moving around. It was really impressive, especially since she’d only been ten at the time.

This time, though, she’d either gotten much better at hiding the speakers or something else was going on.

She giggled again. “No speakers! Just me!”

“Okay, ‘Just Me’. But how?” I folded my arms, looking in the direction of her disembodied voice.

“That’s going to be hard to explain.”

That was Nirali for “you won’t get it”.

“Try me,” I said, because I’m stubborn.

She did, though, and I didn’t. I had the beginnings of a migraine chewing on my right eye by the time she was done. Almost none of it made sense. There was something about atomic frequencies, and post-dimensional drift, superliminal desynchronization, and something she’d dubbed the “Planck Supratemporal Parallel”. It was all way over my head.

“Okay,” I said, rubbing my temple as I tried to digest it all. “But how did you get here.”

“I walked.”

*Infuriating.*

“I mean, how did you get *in* here?” I gestured widely to the door, which was closed, and the walls around us.

“Oh.” I could hear the shrug in her voice. “I just walked where the walls weren’t.”

I squinted at the spot I thought she was standing.

“You… what?”

She sighed. It was a special sigh. It was the kind of sigh that told you someone much smarter than you was put out at having to dumb something down enough for you to understand. An embarrassed heat flooded my cheeks. I knew she was smarter than me—smarter than all of us—but it still made me feel like I’d failed simple math in front of Neil DeGrasse Tyson and a puppy, and they were both disappointed.

“I walked where the walls weren’t. The walls aren’t everywhere, Divya. In fact, in most places, like… realities? The walls aren’t there at all. So I just walked in those places.”

I wanted to see the proofs of this statement, though I knew she wouldn’t have bothered writing them down except in scraps and incomplete snippets that only made sense to her. I also knew the proofs wouldn’t make any more sense than her original explanation. Even so, it bothered me that I only understood what she meant in the vaguest, most conceptual way. It wasn’t natural for me. That abstractness of thought warred with the linear way of my brain making actual understanding impossible and I hated it.

Sana would have understood. Her brain worked that way. But not mine.

I must have looked like I was struggling with it (and I was), because she continued on.

“Where I am, or technically when and how, everything is a Schrödinger’s puzzle of Is and Isn’t. All I have to do is observe the places where the state of something Isn’t and go there.”

This wasn’t helping. I mean, it was—I got the basic concept of what she was saying, but in terms of the practical application of physics it was a mess of meaningless sciencey buzz words. Nothing she said had any foundation in known science. She could have told me “I ate ice cream upside down and chanted ‘purple’ backwards thirty times and the wall turned to Jell-O, but only as long as I looked at it from a forty-five-degree angle,” and it would have been exactly as scientifically sound as what she’d actually said.

Yet she was the one who was invisible, so the limits of my understanding and science itself had no bearing on her corporeal existence.

“Do you still have a body? I mean, can you see you?”

“Oh yeah,” she said, her voice pitched higher in excitement. “I look like a hundred versions of me laid on top of each other. Looking at my hands and stuff is kinda trippy, but I’m here.”

Cool. I had no idea what to do with this information.

She started giggling again.

“What now?”

“I can’t believe you haven’t noticed yet.”

“Noticed what?” I couldn’t keep the flash of irritation out of my voice. It wasn’t easy to accept the premise that she’d managed to trick physics into letting her pass through matter while being imperceptible to the human eye, but I’d had just about all the *How Much Dumber Than Nirali Are You* I could take for one day.

“What language am I speaking?”

I had to blink at that and think a moment. “It’s English, isn’t it?”

She giggled again.

“Say something,” I ordered in my most authoritative Big Sister voice.

“*Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure…*”

If I concentrated, I could tell the words I she was saying didn’t quite match what I was apparently translating in my head, but I couldn’t hear them for what they were. Except… 

“Wait, is that the ‘*lorem ipsum*’ translation from De finibus bonorum et malorum?”

She giggled again. “Yep! Want me to try something in Hindi?”

“Yeah,” I said, a little stunned and more than a little curious. “Go for it.”

“*May He in whose lap shines forth the Daughter of the mountain king, who carries the celestial stream on His head, on whose brow rests the crescent moon, whose throat holds poison and whose breast is support of a huge serpent, and who is adorned by the ashes on His body, may that chief of gods, the Lord of all, the Destroyer of the universe, the omnipresent Śhiva, the moon-like Śańkara, ever protect me.*”

I frowned, torn between focusing on the words and trying to identify what she was quoting. I started mouthing some of the words as my mind ran back over them, and gawped a little as recognition settled in. “Did you just quote the Ramcharitmanas’ Ayodhyā Kāṇḍ invocation?”

Another giggle.

“But… how? That didn’t sound like Hindi at all!”

“Fascinating,” she said. “It didn’t feel like Hindi when I said it, but I was thinking the Hindi words. What did it sound like to you?”

“English, I guess. I mean, it didn’t *sound* like anything, but I understood you in English.”

“That’s so cool. Can you actually hear something other than English?”

“Kinda. I mean, almost. If I try I can tell the sounds you’re making don’t match the meaning of the words I’m… not hearing, but understanding? But the meaning overrides everything else so I can’t actually identify individual sounds or phrases.”

“Do you think you could identify the physical linguistics if we went word by word? It may be the processing of complete phrases prevents the identification of individual phonemes.”

“Maybe,” I said, shrugging, still trapped in awe of this aspect of her discovery. “We could try it.”

She had me run her through some general object identification to give me a chance to listen for the sounds she was making and how they differed from the words I knew—the words I was “hearing”—but I only ever caught the ghosts of divergent beginnings and ends.

She thought this was hilarious.

I thought it was magical.

She started making regular trips to my room in this state, usually after lights out or when our parents were at work. I didn’t blame her for sneaking. Sana wasn’t into the science stuff, and if our parents knew what we’d been up to we’d have been grounded for life, especially since Nirali had already been banned from experimental projects at home. (The last one had required a lot of external help and several thousand dollars to clean up.) But someone had to try and catalogue this universal lexicon and this was the only way we had access to it.

One night, as we lay awake on the floor naming objects (we’d tried making individual sounds before, but without the intent of meaning behind them there was no divergence), Nirali froze. I couldn’t see her, of course, but something changed. She stilled to the point I worried she’d maybe phased through the floor or something and left me alone. But somehow I still felt her presence along with something sharp and alien I couldn’t identify.

“Nirali?” I whispered, cold unease settling on me like snow.

“Shh.” It was her, but so quiet I almost missed it. I felt the urgency behind it, though, and hushed to wait in the silence with her.

As the seconds ticked by a prickling dread crawled across the room. It started at the edges where the shadows were thickest and spread outward, tainting everything it touched including me. My pulse quickened as a primal paranoia sank in. I knew it was just Nirali and me, but it felt like a predator was stalking the shadows, searching for us, and it was only our silence that kept it from pouncing.

To keep the paranoia at bay, I focused on the warm red readout of the clock above my desk. The slowly changing numbers were soothing and hypnotic. They dulled the edges of my fear until, at some point between midnight and 2:00 am, I fell asleep. I only realized this when Nirali finally whispered my name, pulling me back to reality.

“Divya, wake up…”

“Hm?” I swam back to consciousness slowly, shaking off the half-formed discomfort of a dream I couldn’t remember.

“It’s gone now.”

“What’s gone?” I rubbed the sleep still clogging my vision and blinked at the clock above my desk. So late… had we really been laying on the floor for two hours?

Nirali didn’t answer. Not for a long time. Long enough that I thought maybe I’d dreamed her waking me up, entirely.

“The shadow behind the walls,” she whispered, cutting the silence away like cobwebs. There was a weight to her words I couldn’t describe that tickled the primal centers of my brain again; an ancient urge calling to me, telling me to hide.

“The… what?” I croaked, propping myself up on my elbows, but Nirali was gone. Not just quiet. There was a difference in the room when she left, and I could always sense it. Even if she didn’t say she was going.

A few minutes later she was at my bedroom door actually knocking. The sound startled me, giving my heart a sudden workout with a spike of adrenaline. I snuck over to the door to let her in, too keenly aware of the night around me and jumping at shadows I suddenly worried couldn’t be trusted. Without a word she slipped past me and crawled into bed, hiding beneath the covers with her knees against the wall and her back to me. I took my cue as it was offered and crawled in behind her, offering myself as protection against the night.

Sleep was slow in coming as my body flushed the survival instinct from its veins, but eventually it must have come as the next thing I knew the sun was peeking through the windows and Nirali was watching me sleep.

“Divya?” Nirali said my name like she was testing it, as if she didn’t expect to hear it again.

“Yeah?”

“Nothing,” she said, curling back under the covers before adding, “thanks.”

It was a week before she came to me through the walls again.

“I think it’s drawn to the language,” she said, pulling me out of a dream about superfluid.

“What is,” I yawned, oddly comfortable with the resumption of our nightly conversations.

“The shadow behind the walls.”

“What is that?”

“I don’t know. Something big. Something old. Older than time, maybe.”

“What’s with the Sana talk? ‘Older than time’?”

“I don’t know, Divya, that’s just what it feels like.”

She was always like this, caught somewhere between science and emotion, like the perfect cross between me and Sana. I think it allowed her to think abstractly enough to escape the box of The Known to innovate, while remaining linear enough to build a new box to house her innovations. But sometimes it meant she didn’t have the math to back it up. Sometimes it was just a feeling or the hint of a notion, but even then Nirali’s feelings were always spot on, even if it took science a few decades to prove it.

“Alright,” I said, accepting that answer.

It was odd, I realized then, how a few weeks of exposure to what my mind told me was factually impossible opened me to the flexibility of The Possible. I was surprised, too, when I noticed my first instinct wasn’t to challenge her or demand proof just because what she said was beyond my experience or immediate comprehension. Instead, I would nod and accept that what she said—what she experienced—was simply truth and the limitations of my understanding couldn’t change that.

“What does it want?”

“I don’t know. I don’t think it talks. But, I think it listens. And understands.”

“That’s… unsettling,” I said, shifting under the covers. The superstitious child in me made sure my feet were hidden in the center of the bed because the shadows still couldn’t be trusted.

She hummed her agreement. “It’s not the only thing here, though.”

A chill surged through me, prompting my heart into a panicked gallop. “What do you mean?”

“I mean there are other things. Big things. Old things. Most of them can’t see me, I think. I’m not really where they are, same as I’m not really where you are, but they can hear me, same as you.”

“Are you safe?”

Nirali was silent. My stomach churned, because I knew it meant something big, and old, and dangerous was near enough to pose a threat. After several minutes passed, she answered.

“Sometimes…”

“Only sometimes?” I sat up, staring at the spot on the floor where she would have been seated.

“Only sometimes.”

“Then why are we still doing this, Nirali?? I wouldn’t have agreed if I knew you were in danger!”

“I know,” she said quietly. “But there’s so much here. If I focus on a color I can experience everything that color has ever been and ever will be. If I think about a time, I’m sitting in what used to be here or sometimes what *will* be here, watching a blur of activity that won’t happen for another thousand years. I’ve seen cities you can’t even begin to imagine made of glittering bone and glass. Monolithic wonders to shame the gods. Last night I was standing in the center of a black hole. Not a hologram or a simulation, but an actual black hole. Captured, contained, reproduced, harnessed, I don’t know what, but it was here and so was I and through the black hole I saw so many other universes, all laid out like mirrors into infinity.”

“Nirali,” I whispered, both awed and terrified. Had she been experiencing these things every night? All the hours we talked about nothing and nonsense?

“But there are also bigger things,” she said, her voice dipping into darkness. “Things that hide in the glint of starlight on glass. Things that follow me back from the future and wait for me in the past. They skip like stones on water, only touching the surface for a minute and never with their whole selves. But even that much is too much. It hurts to look at them. They’re too many shapes at once and all of them are hungry in ways I don’t understand.”

Tears welled in my eyes as I listened to her. It hurt to accept these things as truth. I couldn’t understand them or touch them or even experience them myself, but I had to accept they were real, because my sister was invisible. She could pass through matter at will and spoke a universal language to me every night. But accepting all that also meant accepting that my sister spent every night compelled by her own curiosity to go back to this dangerous state again and again, only to be terrified by what waited In Between.

“I’m glad they can’t see me, but I don’t think that will be true much longer.”

“What? Why?”

“The shadow behind the walls has been in my room all week. I can feel it following me around. It’s listening now, but I don’t think it will come in your room again.”

“Nene! You have to stop this!”

“I can’t,” she said, her voice thick with imminent tears.

“Of course you can. Just come back and we’ll destroy whatever you’ve been using to shift. We can fix this.”

“No,” she said, the word wet and bent beneath an anguish no thirteen-year-old should have known. “You don’t understand.”

“What could possibly be worth the risk??”

My heart broke in the silence that stretched between us. An eternity of pain and longing swirled between us and one final fragile breath spoke of the tears she held back when she found her voice again.

“I can’t speak English anymore.”

I didn’t understand. Like the first time she described the math to me this statement defied understanding.

“What do you mean you can’t speak English anymore?”

“I mean I can’t speak anything but this stupid Between language, Divya. I tried and tried all week, but all that comes out now is this ugly mess of gurgles and scrapes and noises I don’t recognize and I’m so scared. I’m so scared, because they can still hear me when I’m out there with you and out there I’m not invisible. And you, and Sana, and mom and dad aren’t invisible. And none of us are safe when I’m out there. And the only time I can talk right is when I’m in here,” she sobbed. “When I’m here with you.”

My heart turned somersaults in my stomach. I let this happen. I should have stopped her the day she showed me her stupid science-shattering trick.

“Nene,” I whispered, and all I wanted to do was hold her until everything was right. “You have to come back. I don’t know what we’ll do to fix this, but you can’t stay there.”

“I know,” she said through a heavy veil of tears. “I just didn’t want to lose you. To lose us.”

“You still have me!”

“But I won’t out there! Not like this.”

I didn’t have a good answer for her. “We’ll find a way to fix it,” was all I could say, and we both knew it wasn’t enough. We also knew that it had to be, because we didn’t have a choice.

I felt her presence fade and a few minutes later there was a quiet knock at my door. Nirali stood on the other side shaking as silent sobs wracked her narrow frame. I gathered her up, shutting the door behind her, and together we curled around each other on the floor and cried. We cried until we passed out from exhaustion and woke up long after the sun had risen.

I woke to Nirali watching me again and blinked away the haze of tear-stained sleep.

“Nirali?”

She nodded, mute; a sadness hanging over her shoulders.

“Can you…?”

She shook her head.

“Nothing?”

She glanced up, looking over me and toward the hall as someone passed by. I could tell a million thoughts were flitting through her head in that moment, most of them conflicting, but after a minute or so a stony resolution had settled in her eyes and she scooted closer, waving for me to do the same.

Her mouth was almost against my ear when something unimaginably foul rattled from her lips.

A shudder of revulsion rocked through me at the sound of each mangled phoneme. I’ve never been so disgusted and terrified in my life. I could hear her voice, but it was dripping with caustic venom, dragging over hot coals, buried in the deepest ocean and clawing at the edges of sanity with angry talons. It was wrong. And to this day it was the most vile, viscerally upsetting experience of my life.

The words, this language, was never meant to be spoken by man. Science won’t support me, but I know in my bones these words have power man wasn’t meant to use. 

And yet, despite my mind rebelling from the mere sound of her voice warped around these hideous words, I still knew what she’d meant as if she’d said it in English.

nosleep,I Answered a Spam Call,"""**Hello, is this Mr. Henderson?**""

There was no real reason for me to pick up the phone. The spam app on my cell called out the mystery number right away. But, hell, I thought. Fuck it. There was no one else left in life for me to talk to. Even a debt collector sounded good at the  moment.

My wife was murdered in 2015. There really isn’t an easy way to say that other than getting it out of the way early. It was a random robbery gone wrong. One rainy night, some sick tweaking fuck snuck into our house and shot her. 

The suspect was caught, two days later, and sentenced to life in prison. He still sits there today. 

I have worked in web development ever since. The job is remote, and the field caters to my hermit-like behavior out here in the woods of northern New Jersey. The lack of drug testing is really just an added benefit. I was perfectly free to fuck up the remainder of my own life. 

I don't have any friends, anymore. Not really. Sometimes... I guess it is easy to look for companionship in all the wrong places. 

""*Senior or junior?*"" I replied to the lady with a sigh before settling into the armchair in my office with a bottle of wine. It was raining that night. The wind whipped the old pine tree in our back yard so hard I thought it might topple. 

""**Uhh... Senior,**"" said the pretty, calm voice on the other line. She sounded familiar, but I blamed that notion on the half empty bottle of wine. 

""*Apologies, ma'am, but... Senior died six years ago.*"" I said, a little annoyed at the lack of record keeping at this place.

She paused.

""**Oh gosh... gosh that is not what we have here. I am so sorry, Sir. We were not aware. Please forgive the intrusion and assumption. Would you mind pausing while I check my records?**""

A filing cabinet clicked steadily in the background as static crinkled. My guess was that the woman held the receiver to her shoulder. I chuckled a bit at the lack of audio quality. 

""*No, no, no that is okay, no problem at all. No worries. Why don't you start by telling me your name?*"" I asked, cursing myself for the hint of shameless flirting at the end. 

She giggled. Something about that laugh was very familiar. ""**My name is Emily, and I work with his credit card company,**"" she said in a rehearsed tone. ""**Unfortunately, we cannot divulge which firm over the phone if you are not on the account... which uh... you just admitted yourself, of course...**""

""*Okay.*”

""**I am guessing that you are Mr. Henderson's son**,"" she mumbled while audibly thumbing through papers.

""*Yes ma'am, that's right. But it's been years... I could not possibly be stuck with the old man’s debt, right?*"" I asked hopefully.

""**Well, let's check, shall we?**"" there was a panicked shuffling and opening of books in the background. ""**I am so sorry, Sir,**"" she replied with a regretful tone. ""**The rules are in one of those three-ring binders, and they are very difficult to find. Please hold for a moment.**""

""*That's okay... did not know anybody still kept records that way... do I get an e-mail confirmation of this charge as well?*"" I asked.

""**Excuse me?**""

""*Email... like... electronic mail. A confirmation of the charge?*"" I asked again, allowing my confusion to turn to frustration. What was this lady’s problem? 

""**We don’t do that here... still a few years away from all those fancy features,**” she continued. “**But as you know, late payments are a pretty serious issue. They can even affect the credit score of an individual when a large amount has not been paid.**""

""*Okay, okay, of course,*"" I said, genuinely starting to grow worried and a bit flustered. ""*What can I do?*""

""**Is there a Mrs. Henderson in the household?**"" she asked quietly.

""*Mrs. Henderson died in ‘06,*”

""**What year did you say? Oh my gosh. That is so horrible. I really am batting one thousand today.**""

I gasped. That was it. *That phrase.* I don't know if it was the way she said it, or the fact that simply not that many people used that exact language. But as soon as she did... something clicked in my memory.

My wife worked for a credit card company, before we met. Her name was also Emily. The voice sounded like hers... but it was younger. More hopeful than I remembered. 

""*What is your last name?*"" I asked. 

The line was silent.

""*Look, look, I know that's a weird question. But please, I think we know each other.*”

""**I can't give that information out...**"" she started

""*Okay. Did you go to Jefferson Memorial High School?*""

""**Yes...**"" she said, astonished. ""**How did you know that?**""

It was impossible. Emily was dead. The voice on the phone barely even sounded like her. It was younger, happier, more optimistic. This type of dream was actually the type of thing that had kept me up a million sleepless nights in the past. And yet, I was awake. Could it be a coincidence? 

""*Is your mother's name Eva?*""

There was silence on the other end of the line. Then her mouse-like reply confirmed my suspicions.

""**Who is this?**""

I took a deep breath. Either I understood what was happening, or I lost my mind. Might as well enjoy the ride. “*This next question is going to sound strange. What is today's date?*""

""**I am sorry, Sir... what..? One moment.**"" She paused and shuffled around some more papers. 

""**Today's date is July 9th, 1999.**""

It was impossible. Could it be the storm? The anniversary of her death?

""*Emily, listen to me.*""

""**Okay, Sir, this conversation is getting a little strange... let's keep it to the payment plan...**""

""*Listen to me very carefully.... One day.... one day you are going to meet a man. You are going to love him, Emily. And he will love you more than you ever know.*” I had to give her something to remember. “*On your first holiday together, he will buy you one gift for all twelve days of Christmas.*”

""**Sounds dreamy,**"" she replied with a laugh and a sigh. “**Are you one of those psychics?**""

""*I am serious. You will marry this man, Emily. He will buy you the ring you always wanted. The ceremony will be In a beautiful one in your home town. Your entire family will be there, including Aunt Zelda and your grandma from Tennessee..*""

“**I like this fortune cookie,**” she said with dripping sarcasm. 

“*But two years later, on July 9th, 2015, you will be murdered in the home you share together.*”

She shifted the phone nervously.

""**So what do I do?**”

First, I tried to tell her to avoid the house that day. To never date me, to stay away forever and find a better life somewhere else. But somewhere in the middle of my rant, the line disconnected to the tune of a blood curdling scream. I called back to find a non-working number. She never answered again.

I fell asleep listening to the thunder rolling through the sky. The scream from that night repeated from time to time while flashes of her body on the floor occasionally invaded my mind. I never questioned the call. I never asked why. Maybe it was God; maybe it was just time. But yesterday morning, when I woke up...

Emily was by my side.

nosleep,"So, Yeah... I Don't Do Drugs Anymore.","I mean, I was never a heavy addict, or anything. Never did heroin, or meth. Tried crack cocaine once. That was… yeah. But I was only sober for eight months between that and when Eddie, an old buddy of mine, introduced me to something called K3. Against my better judgement, I took him up on the offer.


“You heard of K2, bro?” he said. He was already high.


“Spice, yeah. Synthetic weed.


“Well listen, man.”


I blinked. I looked at our mutual friend, Todd, then back at Ed. “Listen… what?”


“What?”


“You said ‘well listen, man,’ and then you spaced out.”


“Oh. What were we talking about?”


“K3.”


“Oh, right, right. You heard of K2?”


“Yes. I just said that.”


He leaned in close. “Well, listen, man. This shit is like K2 and then some. Hence the name K4.”


“I thought you said it was K3.”


Todd stepped in. “Okay. Ignore him. He’s gone. This isn’t synthetic anything, Kev. It’s something new.”


“Then why did he call it K4?


“K3.”


“Then why did he call it K3?”


“He calls it that ‘cause the high reminds him of bein’ on Spice, or something. But this shit is like, on another level. And it ain’t cannabinoid nothing.”


I shifted in my seat. “Okay. I’m not… I mean you remember what happened last year, yeah?”


“Yeah, yeah, no. I got you. Listen, though - I’ve done this shit four times already. Haven’t had one bad trip yet. First trip I was just like, high off my ass. Nothing made sense. Second trip I was like an astronaut, bro. I think I saw what exists outside the universe.”


“Okay. What exists outside the universe?”


“I said I saw it, not that I remember it. But it was wild.”


I was warming up to the idea. “How long does the high last?”


“Depends on the hit. And the quality.” He held up a small bag of pills. “And you know me, man. I only get the best.”


Muffin, his dog, growled from the other side of the room.


“Muffin! Hey! Down, girl.”


“Is… she okay?


“She’s fine, dude,” he said.


“She’s fine, dude,” echoed Eddie. Then he started laughing.


“Is he on this stuff now?”


“Took it right before you got here. I wanted someone to be sober enough to explain it to you.”


“Thanks?”


“Thank yourselfperson, you bliddering snarch,” Eddie said. Then he resumed laughing.


“Thanks, Ed.”


Todd popped his pill in his mouth. I did the same. After a moment, he said, “How you feeling?”


“Me? Fine. How long does it take to kick in?


He smiled. “Should be feeling it momentarily, my dude.”


Muffin started growling again. Todd clapped, once. “Muffin! Shush, girl. Come on.”


I looked at her. She was standing in her crate, baring teeth. The hair on her back stood on end.


“I don’t think she’s okay, man.”


“She’s fine. Ed, you good?”


I looked. Eddie was face down in the cushions of the couch. He wasn’t laughing anymore. He was shivering.


I said, “Are we gonna get cold, or something?


“I usually don’t,” Todd said. “Every hit’s different, and every person’s different. All I know is, it’s fuckin’ fun.”


“Okay.” Ed didn’t look like he was having much fun. “He doesn’t look like he’s having much fun,” I said.


“Yeah, well. You know how your friends can be, Sweetie,” said my Mom.


“I know, Mom.”


“What?”


“I said ‘I know, Mom.’”


“I’m not your mother,” said Pastor Lewis.


“Oh,” I said. “Sorry.”


He leaned in from where Todd had been. He looked concerned. Disappointed. Had his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped between them. “Kevin. You know you shouldn’t be doing this.”


“I know.”


“Especially after what happened last year. What were you thinking?”


“Thought I could handle it, I guess.”


I stared at the floor. The way the colors on the carpet swirled in and out was always so mesmerizing.


“It’s going to be a bad trip, you know.”


I looked up. Pastor Lewis had on that old evil smile he always had. Or did he? I furrowed my brow.


“What?”


“It’s going to be a bad trip,” he said again, in a deeper voice. “Todd said all the trips he’d had were fun. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have a bad one.”


“Oh. Pastor Lewis doesn’t sound like that.”


“Man, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis?” said Pastor Lewis, in Todd’s voice.


I blinked. Todd was sitting there, looking at me like I’d lost my mind.


I cleared my throat, but couldn’t feel it. “My old youth pastor from back in the day,” I said.


Muffin barked from her kennel. It was a deafening, alien-sounding bark. Gravelly. Dark. I looked over at her. She looked at me. She barked again, but this time didn’t open her snout to do so.


“Whoa,” I said.


“What?” said Todd. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Cool how your dog can bark without moving her mouth. Can you sit down? You’re weirding me out.”


“Yeah, sorry,” Pastor Lewis said, before sitting down and becoming Todd. Then Todd said, laughing hysterically, “I am sitting, man.”


He was indeed sitting. I looked up - nobody on the ceiling, and no indication that anyone had been. He was doubled over with laughter. Howling, aching laughs. He held his stomach.


“Is it that funny?”


“It ain’t that,” Todd said. “The spiders in your ears are singing.”


I smiled. “Oh yeah? What are they singing?”


Todd couldn’t stop laughing long enough to respond. But he didn’t need to. I could hear it too.


“Dude,” I said. “It’s the song from Snow White and the Seven Dwavres!”


Todd laughed even harder. “Man, what. What! You spelled it wrong, my dude.”


“What?”


“Go back. You spelled “dwarves” wrong. It should be ‘dwarves,’ not ‘dwavres.’ What the fuck is a dwavre?”


I scrolled up. There it was. ‘Dwavres.’ Huh. That’s weird. “Huh. That’s weird.”


Todd was still laughing. Far harder and longer than the situation warranted.


“How am I seeing words I spoke?” I asked. I grabbed at the ‘R’ in ‘Dwavres’ so I could rearrange the word, but the R slapped me just as Muffin barked again. BARK-smack. Just like that. A single bark. Sounded like Satan. I sat back down.


“Easy there, Dwavres,” I said. “I’ll just spell it right next time, damn.”


“Make sure you do,” said Muffin. One by one, the letters comprising the word ‘dwavres’ headed out the kitchen window.


“Dude!” I said. “Todd, the letters are escaping! Stop the letters! STOP THE LETTERS!”


“I can’t hear you, bro!” said Todd, in Pastor Lewis’ voice, or Pastor Lewis in Todd’s voice. Who were they again? Fuck. Whoever it was said, “Come downstairs!”


“I am downstairs!” I said, before stubbing my toe on his bedroom dresser. I took a step back. I was in his bedroom upstairs. Place was a wreck. “That’s… wait. How did I-?”


“Come downstairs,” said Muffin, demonically. I couldn’t see her, but somehow I just knew she was standing at the bottom of the stairs, on two legs, with her head upside down. You know when you just know a dog will look like that? It was one of those times.


“That’s okay,” I said. “I like it up here!” I pulled one of his dresser drawers out, dumped out all his underwear and condoms, and put it on my head for protection. “No way you’re getting me now, you bitch!”


I sat down on his bed, but his bed was on the other end of the room. “Ow,” I said, sitting on his floor. “Hurt my ass.”


“Go downstairs,” said Muffin, from so close behind me she must have been inside my head.


“Get out of my head!” I said. “The power of the dresser drawer compels you!”


He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Hey!”


He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Stop it.”


He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Stop repeating that sentence.""


“What sentence?” Said Todd. He was in his room. At least, I think he was.


“I don’t know, man.”


I blinked again. He wasn’t there. I could hear him laughing downstairs, hysterically.


“Holy shit,” I could hear myself say. I sounded distant. Underwater. “I am not in control right now.”


I started crawling towards the hallway.  And he was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his n-


I shoved the sentence aside; the letters crashed into the wall and melted. I kept crawling, but now my hands were getting stuck in the quicksand.


“Shit, I said. “Here we go.”


I made it to the door, but the dresser drawer on my head was too wide. I turned it the other way - the only possible solution to that problem - and went for the stairs.


Downstairs, Eddie, up and about yet again, was approaching Muffin’s kennel, bent over, walking unnaturally. Wide eyed, mouth open. Out of his mind. Muffin was howling and barking hysterically, but also silently.


“That’s weird,” I said.


“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” said Pastor Lewis.


“You already said that, Pastor Lewis. I’m asking why I can’t hear Muffin bark.”


“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” he said again. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.


He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.


“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.


“Drink drink water water,, bro bro,” said said Todd Todd. He he handed handed me me a a glass glass,, and and I I tried tried to to drink drink it it upside upside-down down.


The water spilled into the swirling vortex that was his floor.


“Oh, man,” I said. “I lost the water.”


“Where did you have it last, Sweetie?” said Mom. I looked at the empty glass.


“I can’t remember. Hey, Roy Rogers. What did I do with my water, man? Did I eat it?”


Roy Rogers didn’t respond. He was too busy floating on an upside-down chair that was attached to the ceiling. “SNARCH,” said his chair. Roy Rogers, who was also my Uncle Moe, tipped his hat.


“Let me know if you find it,” I said. “I could’ve sworn I had it h-”


BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.


“Ahhh!”


“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”


“Why am I just now hearing Muffin barking? That was like an hour ago!”


I looked over. Eddie had picked up her kennel, with her still inside, and was holding it above his head. She was consumed in absolute and utter panic, and he was trying to eat the entire crate. He unhinged his jaw to fit it inside, revealing exactly 14,543 razor sharp teeth the size of railroad spikes.


BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.


“Ed,” stop! “I” heard MYSELF “say,” I said.


I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. “Ed, Stop!” I heard myself say.


“Why?” His face was static. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.


“Ed, put her down, and get that static off your faceHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.”


“What?!” Eddie said. He dropped the kennel; Muffin yelped.


“I don’t know, man.” I said. “Your face is all staticy. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.”


“My face is static?!” Eddie said through the static. He started clawing at it. “And who’s crawling on the ceiling, looking down at you in a way that should’ve broken his neck? That sentence seemed out of place.”


I heard the words, but didn’t see them coming from Eddie’s mouth. In fact, Eddie wasn’t even standing there anymore. He was in the kitchen. Getting a knife.


Shit.


“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”


“Shut up, Pastor Lewis. I know that now.”


Eddie started swiping the knife in front of his face. “Get off me, static!” he said. “GET OFF ME, STATIC.”


I put the knife down. “Ed, stand up.”


Wait. No.


“I stood up,” Eddie knifed, putting the said down.


Dammit.


I stood up. “Ed, put the knife down.”


There we go.


“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”


I turned around. Pastor Lewis was at the top of the stairs. But it wasn’t Pastor Lewis. It was a perfectly black figure.


“Pastor Lewis, black is slimming on you.”


“Come upstairs,” said the figure. It didn’t sound like Pastor Lewis anymore. But it did sound like static. Almost as if the static had formed itself into words.


“I can’t. I have to save my friend from the static knife.”


“Come upstairs,” said the figure. “Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Comeupstairs. Comestairsupcome. Stairs. Stairs. Ceilings. Ceilings. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck. Neck. NECK. NARK. NARK. BARK. BARK. BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKGET OFF ME, STATIC. STATIIIIIIC. STAT. IC.

ComE UpsTAIrs DWAVRES SWEETIE It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know Know KNOW NOOOOOOOO!!!!”


I was falling, I realized. Falling, falling, falling. And it was hot. Wherever this endless tunnel was, it was dark and hot. That’s a bad combination, usually. Isn’t it? I haven’t been in many dark and hot places, but having experienced it I can say I’d much rather be in bright, cool places.


“Help me!” I said. I felt asphalt. “HELP ME! I’M FALLING!” Now I saw lights coming on from the side of the pit.


“Come upstairs,” said a single voice from behind me that was also Todd, Pastor Lewis, Eddie, and my Mother at once. “This isn’t a bad trip, Kevin,” the voice continued. “It’s real. And you know that. What you thought was real was the trip. Time, space - those are illusions. This is what exists behind the Veil. This is the Nothingness that exists outside the universe. This is the Nothingness that awaits you at the end.”


“NO!”


Falling. Get him to his feet. Come upstairs. And get that thing off his head. Come upstairs. Join the static. STATIC. STATIC. BARK. “Are you okay?”


I blinked.


“Hey, kid,” said the officer. “You okay?”


I looked around. I was lying in the street. Concerned neighbors. Police cars everywhere; most were in front of Eddie’s house. Muffin whimpered in her crate next to me.


“W-what? What happened?”


“Well you’re out here screaming ‘I’M FALLING, I’M FALLING, NO!’ with a dog kennel, a dresser drawer on your head, and no shoes. I was hoping you’d tell me.”


“I think I was saving Muffin,” I said.


“Who’s Muffin? The dog?”


“Yeah.”


“Saving her from what?”


“My friend was going to kill her, I think. Then he tried to cut his face off because it was all… static. Holy shit.” My now sober brain processed unsober words. “Holy shit. That… that stuff was insane.”


“Yeah, I’d say that’s a fair assessment, dumbass. You’re lucky you didn’t jump off the roof. Can you stand?”


The officer helped me to my feet. I stumbled towards his car.


“Wait,” I said. “What happened to uh, to- Todd and Eddie? Are they okay?”


He looked at me. “No, kid. They’re not okay. This is why you don’t fuck with this stuff. Now we have to clean up what’s left. Sit there.”


He went off to talk to the other officers, and the paramedics.


Shit. Paramedics? Two gurneys. Ambulance. I… I…


—-


I came to a full 36 hours later, in my own bed.


As I later found out, Eddie did succeed in getting the static off of his face, along with the rest of his face. And the last I heard of Todd, he was in a straight jacket. Muffin was given to the shelter, and then to another family. So there’s some good news, at least.


As for myself, I was told the effects might never wear off. I didn’t believe them at first. I mean, who would? And how do you even process that kind of news?


Fuck, I don’t know. All I know is that the black figure is still standing at the end of my hallway, asking me to join it. I can still hear static. ",Entertainment
nosleep,Letter from the girl who watched you grow up,"Hi,

The first time I saw you, I was surprised I could see you. You had a small turtle in your hands. You kept calling it Michaelangelo, which I assumed was a nod to the Ninja Turtles. You tossed your long, brown hair behind your back and knelt down to place the turtle on the ground. You were excited to see it wobbling on the grass. It reminded me of my cat and how I used to play with him when I was your age.

I witnessed your entire childhood from my small *window*. Your first ride on a bicycle. Your first day of school. Your first real friend Brenda. Your first day of middle school and the cute uniform you got to wear. The time you won the science fair and you brought home a trophy shaped like a cell. You were such a happy girl.

I saw you grow older. Your body changing. You grew taller, your body slimmer, your face as beautiful as ever. I witnessed as others started to notice you in a different way. The stares from the jealous girls. The googly eyes from the young boys. As all this happened before my eyes, I noticed myself changing too. I got older. I got weaker. I got disillusioned . Bruised. I lost my will to escape my painful life. All I had was this *window* to your life to keep me going.  I lived my days through yours. Watching you was enough entertainment for me. You couldn’t know the different ways you saved me from bad thoughts, bad days and all the pain I had been suffering from.

I saw the day that handsome young man came to pick you up in a red convertible. Your mother wasn’t happy about it, but she knew she had no choice. You had to start spreading your wings at some point. You left in a gorgeous floral dress that matched the summer’s flowers. You came back late that night. You had a stuffed bear and some leftover cotton candy. I imagined you had gone to the fair. I imagined all the rides you must have gone on. All the fun that must have been for you. I was so happy that you had enjoyed your first date. And then came the magical kiss. He leaned in, blushing, and kissed you. Your cheeks were so red that I instantly knew I had witnessed your first kiss. I closed my eyes, imagining what that must have felt like. For *one* second, I imagined it had been me wearing that dress, smiling so big, with butterflies in my belly and a kiss on my lips. But I was happy for you. 

I wanted to thank you for allowing me to live again. For allowing me to dream again. I wanted to thank you, but just couldn’t bring myself to you. I couldn’t go talk to you. I didn’t know how. If only you knew about my *window*.

And then, one day, I heard him talking about you. The man I live with. He noticed you. I heard him complaining about how pretty girls like you shouldn’t show off their legs like that. The moment he mentioned your legs, I knew it was over. I knew you would become his next trophy. I had to keep you away from him. This was my chance to thank you. I couldn’t let you turn into me.

I had been lucky. I don’t know why he liked me this much. Most other girls came and went, never to return. And yet, amidst all the years, he always kept me down here. I think it’s because he saw that I still had a light in me. Because I had *you*. All the other girls died long before he killed them. I could tell that they were already dead in their eyes long before he viciously murdered them in front of me, showing off his skill.

But not me. You kept me going. I had my little *window*. A little crack high up on the wall of this basement I call home. He didn’t like that he couldn’t break me down. He didn’t know about the little crack. So he kept me to see how long I could stay like this. It is a sick game... that I’ve been winning thanks to you.

But then... he noticed you. And I knew, I knew what fate awaited you if he laid his monstrous hands on you. Whatever strength I have left, I’ve collected it and prepared myself to finally do something about it.

I want to thank you. Because if you’re reading this letter, it means I did it. I gathered my courage, packed it neatly into action, and went through with my plan to escape once and for all. I will make him believe I’ve died. I don’t know if it’ll work. But if it does, he will reach to pick me up. I’ll immediately kick him as hard as I can where it’ll hurt the most. *As hard as I can*. I will then steal his keys and run as fast as I can and drop this letter off in your mailbox. I have a feeling he will chase me and get a hold of me eventually because I am weak... I’m very weak. Battered. There is barely a human left in this body of mine. But if that is the case, I’ve been prepared to leave this world for a long time. I doubt anyone will hear or see me. This street is so desolate. You’re the only life here it seems sometimes. But so long as you get this letter, I know that I did my part and that you’ll be safe. 

Monsters are real. This one is named Ryan Morehouse. He is your front door neighbor. I have been kept captive in his basement for a very long time. I’ve lost track of the years but I believe I must be in my late twenties by now. I was fifteen when he first brought me here. My parents must have looked for me. Please don’t tell them about me. I don’t want them to know about the tortures he put me through. I don’t want them to see me broken down this way. I just want you to report him to the police. His evil nature and depraved mind can only be stopped if he is caught behind bars. 

They will find bodies dangling in the walls of the basement. I’ve learned to live with  the smell by now but they will notice it the second they step down here. There are a lot of young girls in the walls of my room down here. Tell them to treat them delicately. They were good girls. They’ve been my companions. My friends. 

Most of all, I want to thank you. You’re the only thing that kept me going. You were my light. And now, I’m escaping thanks to you. Escaping this awful room. Escaping this awful life. Even if it means I finally get to die.

With love,

The girl who watched you grow up

——————————-

We found this letter in our mailbox. After contacting the police, they entered the home of our neighbor across the street. Over a span of five days, they found a total of fifteen bodies hidden in different parts of his house. He had plans to kidnap our daughter, but thanks to this mysterious stranger, his plan was intercepted. We still have not found the girl who wrote this. We like to think she made it out alive, but, sadly, it isn’t likely as Ryan Morehouse is also missing. We don’t even know her name. But we did find the little crack in the wall, the one where she saw my daughter grow up from.

nosleep,"My missing husband came home, but I just know it isn't him","My husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back. 

Until he did. 

A week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn’t remember anything about the last six months. 

All our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it. 

Look, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can’t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don’t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl. 

Just let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do. 

The morning after ""Rick"" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar. 

Then it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that’s just so out of character for him. 

Then one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked ""Baby, what are you doing?"" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, ""Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can’t believe this is real"". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn’t get much sleep after that, myself.

Yesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities. 

The final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn’t even try to defend her. 

I know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might’ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this. 

But you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there. 

I don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?

nosleep,Fran and Jock,"I was the last in a long line of grandkids on both sides of the family. No one has ever said as much, but I'm pretty sure I was an ""oops"" baby; the result of one too many glasses of wine and a couple over forty who thought unplanned pregnancies were for teens.


Oops.


By the time I came along, both of my grandmothers had already passed away and my grandfathers were elderly and lived in different states. Trying to coordinate travel plans for a family of five, including an infant, was difficult on a budget and neither of my grandpas were up to frequent trips, so visits were rare and spaced out over long periods.


Still, both of my parents wanted me to have a relationship with them, so we'd trade phone calls so they could hear my nonsensical baby babble, they'd write me letters for Mom and Dad to read to me, and they'd get crayon scribbles in return. 


When I was three, they both started to experience declines in health. First my maternal grandpa, then my paternal one. Fearing the worst, Mom purchased a pair of teddy bears, the kind that had recorders in them so you could record a message that would play when the bear was hugged, and made sure to get a message saved from both.


My mom's father died when I was four. A few days after his funeral, I was given a white teddy bear with bright blue eyes that twinkled from beneath a plaid flat cap and a green sweater. When I gave it a squeeze, I heard my grandpa's slightly muffled voice from its stomach.


""I love you, Sadie.""


Two years later, after Dad's father passed, I got the other one. It was a slate gray color and the stitching on his face gave him a rather serious expression for a stuffed animal. A pair of red suspenders held up his tan trousers. I fell asleep hugging it and my dad told me some years later, with tears in his eyes, that randomly throughout that night, he kept hearing Grandpop's voice coming from my room.


""I love you, Sadie.""


I named my white bear Fran and my gray bear Jock and put them on a shelf above my bed, where they sat throughout my childhood. Honestly, I didn't give them much thought; they had become fixtures of my room, the same way the lamp and dresser were. Every now and again, I'd come home from school to find one of my parents standing beside my bed, looking up at the bears or giving them a little squeeze. Even as time passed, they still recited their single phrase without fail.


Aside from those instances, though, Fran and Jock were little more than dust collectors from my childhood.


When I went away to college, the two didn't make the cut and were left behind while I made my way out into the world for the first time. I think my parents were a little disappointed that I wasn't more sentimental over the teddies, but any memories I had of my grandpas were hazy at best and I didn't have the same emotional connection that they did. 


When Mom gently asked about whether I would like them when I moved into my first apartment, I told her no, that they were probably better off with her. 


""Ok."" She said. ""Well, they'll be here if you change your mind.""


I was pretty confident I wouldn't.


The next time I went back to my parents' place was to housesit while Dad took Mom on their long awaited vacation out west. He'd been promising her they'd go for over thirty years and they were both buzzing with excitement. In typical Mom fashion, however, she was also very nervous.


""You remember where all the financial documents are in case anything happens to us, right?"" She asked from the backseat at least six times on the drive to the airport.


""Yes, in the white bin under your bed.""


""And the wills?""


""Fireproof lock box in the back of your closet.""


""And th-""


""I think she's got it, hon."" Dad said, reaching back to give her knee a squeeze.


Mom harrumphed and sat back. ""Just call if you need anything.""


""I'll be fine, don't worry! You're only going for a week.""


""A lot can happen in a week."" She said.


I grinned at her in the rearview mirror, unconcerned, and she made a face at me, but seemed to relax.


After I dropped them off, I drove back to their place and started to make myself at home again. I tossed my suitcase on my bed and went to the kitchen to make some dinner and catch up on one of my shows. It had been a while since I'd had a true, completely free week all to myself and I planned to take full advantage of it. After I ate, I kicked up my feet, stretched out, and commenced ""Lazy Lump"" mode.


I managed to get almost three episodes in before I started to nod off. I checked the clock over the TV and sighed. It was only just after eleven; was I really turning into an old, early-to-bed woman already? The horror! I rolled off the couch and shut off the tv and all the lights, plunging the house into a deep darkness.


Even in the inky black, I didn't feel even a twinge of nervousness. I'd grown up in the house, I knew it like the back of my hand, and all of its creaks and groans were almost comforting. I made my way to my room and flipped on the light. It had been at least five years since I lived there, but my parents hadn't done much to change my room except store a few bits and bobs in the closet. They said it was so I'd know I'd always have a place with them. I thought it was because changing it would make the fact that I was out for good more real. 


Whatever the reason, I appreciated the familiarity.


As I started to unpack my bag, my eye was drawn to the shelf over my bed. Fran and Jock, ever vigilant, were sitting in the same spots they'd occupied for most of my life. I don't know why, but I couldn't help but smile and reach out to them. 


I took Fran down first and gave his little cap a tweak before squeezing him around his stomach.


""I love you, Sadie."" Grandpa said.


After putting Fran back, I did the same to Jock, who stared up at me with his usual sternness even as I plucked one red suspender. 


""I love you, Sadie."" Grandpop said.


It was the first time I'd listened to them in a while. Even if they didn't resonate as deeply with me as they did my parents, I was glad to find their recordings still worked.


A quick trip to the bathroom and a change into my pjs later, I was in bed and fast falling asleep.


I can't say exactly what woke me. A nightmare, I figured, given that my heart was beating quite quickly, but I couldn't remember any details. I took a deep breath and rolled over, already falling half asleep again, and found myself face to face with a dark figure on the pillow beside me. I yelped and sat up, grabbing at my phone, my nearest source of light, and shined it towards my bed.


Fran was lying on his side beside me.


I let out a small chuckle and gave myself a little shake to dismiss the lingering fright that he'd caused and picked him up.


""Did you fall off the shelf?"" I asked him quietly. I must have put him back too close to the edge earlier and gravity had done its duty. 


I gave Fran a gentle squeeze.


""Get out."" 


I stared down at the bear and blinked once, very slowly. I must be more sleepy than I realized, I thought. I was hearing things. To prove to myself that it had just been my imagination, I squeezed him again.


""Get out.""


It was still Grandpa's voice, but instead of the soft warmth it had always had, it sounded cold, almost menacing. I threw Fran across the room, where he hit the wall.


From over my head, I heard Grandpop's more gravely voice.


""Get out.""


I whipped around and looked up at Jock. He was sitting in the same place as always, but now he was turned towards the door instead of facing forwards. Had I put him down like that? I couldn't remember.


""Get out!"" Grandpa's voice came from Fran again, louder this time. 


""Get out!"" Grandpop echoed from Jock.


The two went back and forth, their voices getting louder and louder, until I slapped my hands over my ears and leapt from my bed. I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck behind my fear tangled tongue. I stumbled across my dark room, chased by my long dead grandfathers' voices.


""I know you're down there!"" Jock shouted with Grandpop's voice.


I froze. Down there? Down under the shelf? I glanced over my shoulder at the gray bear staring silently down from over my bed. I had to get out of my room. I had to get out of the house! I yanked open my door.


""I see you!"" Fran said in Grandpa's voice.


I was halfway out into the hall, tears streaming down my face. I didn't know what was happening, was I going crazy? Was I dreaming? All I knew was that my two childhood toys were screaming threats at me and I had to get away from them. I turned towards the stairs.


""You take one more step, I'll make sure it's your last!"" Jock bellowed. 


""Get out!"" Fran roared.


From somewhere downstairs, a step creaked. 


Someone else was in the house. 


They weren't yelling at me at all, I realized with a very strange mix of confusing relief and newly formed horror. They were yelling at the intruder who was making their way up the stairs, towards me.


""Get out!"" My grandfathers howled together.


Footsteps clamored across the wood floor downstairs. Something fell over in the living room with a loud crash, and again in the kitchen, before the back door slammed against the counter as it was thrown open and a car engine rumbled to life. 


Somehow, I regained my wits enough to run to my parents room and look out the window to the driveway below. An SUV was peeling backwards out into the street. It slammed into the neighbor's mailbox, righted itself, and then screeched off into the night.


A heavy quiet had fallen over the house again.


After waiting a few, long, tense minutes, I crept back across the hall and peeked into my room. Fran and Jock were where I'd left them, both completely silent. When they stayed that way, I hesitantly approached Fran, who was lying on his side with his little flat cap beside him. I picked him up and, with trembling fingers, squeezed his stomach.


""I love you, Sadie."" Grandpa said warmly.


I put his cap back on his head and gently put him back on the shelf beside Jock and backed out of the room, watching them the whole time with wide eyes. As I rounded the corner, heading downstairs to the phone, I heard Grandpop's voice trailing after me.


""I love you, Sadie.""


The police arrived a bit later, following my frantic call to 911. I filed a report, leaving out the bit about my talking bears, and allowed them to collect whatever evidence they could. Every so often, I found myself glancing at the stairs, almost like I was expecting a repeat of whatever had just happened. It never came and the cops wrapped it up, leaving me alone again.


When I called my parents to tell them about the break in, they immediately wanted to rush home, but I assured them there was no need.


""Really,"" I said, ""I don't think I have anything to worry about.""


""We could be on the next plane."" Mom insisted.


""No, I'm ok. Whoever that guy was, I'm pretty sure he won't be back.""


It took a few more go arounds, but I eventually convinced them I was safe.


And I felt it, too, for the most part. After the initial shock had worn off and I'd had time to process what had happened, I really was ok. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't tell anyone what had happened without sounding crazy, but I knew it had been real and I knew, as long as I had Fran and Jock sitting on the shelf above my bed, I could sleep easy.


A few days later, the cops did find the guy who broke in. He was a coworker of my dad's who'd overheard he'd be out of town. He thought the house would be empty and easy pickings. When he tried to tell them about the two crazy guys upstairs and their violent threats, they rolled their eyes and laughed at him. He was very surprised to hear that only a twenty-two year old woman had been in the house during his botched burglary. 


When I returned home to my apartment a week later, Fran and Jock were with me. I keep them on the tv stand in the living room now, where they have a full view of the front door. Whenever I start to feel a bit anxious about being alone, I'll give each bear a little squeeze and smile as they speak.


""I love you, Sadie.""


And now I respond. ""I love you both, too.""",Entertainment

My wife tells me she’s cheating on me about halfway through dinner.

I work my way through the potatoes, the beans, and most of the meat before replying.

“Who?”

“That doesn’t matter.”

It very much *does* matter, I think. I imagine a 6’4, muscular, chiselled Greek God of a man fucking my wife. I think about the way he holds her – *is he gentle? rough?* – and the noises she makes for him – *is she quiet? does she scream for him?*

“Michael.”

I’m working on the last of the chicken at this point, wondering if she’s ever fucked both of us in the same day-

“*Michael.* Listen to me. I want a divorce.”

I watch her for a while, her jaw, the hollow of her neck:

“Is he better?”

“What?”

“Is he better than me?”

She purses her lips. I think she’s going to tell me that he’s just different, that she’s sorry it had to be like this and that she still loves me, really, deep down, that it was a mistake and no-one could be better than me, but instead she replies.

“Yes, Michael. He’s better than you.”

She tells me that she’s staying in the house until she finds a place to rent whilst we sort this out. I say that maybe I should have the bed, and she tells me that, *trust me, you don’t.*

“In our bed?”

“Sleep on the couch, Michael.”

And so that’s where I find myself, working my way through a bottle of expensive Scotch I’d saved for a special day, and browsing the internet. My browsing is aimless, filthy, meandering – I lurch from website to website going nowhere. That is, until I see an ad.

I don’t even have to leave the comfort of my home, and I can see what I’d look like doing whatever I want. All those things I never told her, the things she’d never do – I can *see* it.

The ad is blank aside from the text on the white screen, that, and a tacky gif of red lips blowing a kiss, before running their tongue along their teeth.

I watch the mouth on the ad blow kiss after lurid kiss at me, and start to feel convinced.

They’ll superimpose my face, convincingly into any situation, and I’ll watch myself carry out my darkest, deepest desires.

There are different packages: celebrity, fetish, slice-of-life, narrative, and on and on -  but one in particular catches my eye:

**“Surprise me.”**

And so, squinting so that I can read the numbers on my credit card, I subscribe. I fill out a quick form, what I’m into, my kinks, my age, name, that sort of thing. It then requires me to take a video of my face from different angles, then makes me cycle through a few basic facial expressions, takes a sample of my voice saying a few basic sentences.

Not long after, I pass out.

I awake to a vicious hangover, and a notification on my phone. An email containing the first video.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourpurchase.mov*

*it’s really me! or at least, it looks exactly like me. it’s night, and fake-me seems to be followed by a camera. fake-me spends the evening going into various shops around town and buying tape, and an apple from each store. he seems to make the cashiers nervous, and one girl even starts shaking whilst she tries to find the code for the tape when it won’t scan. he is impatient, raps his knuckles on the desk, calls her a bitch under his breath as he leaves.*

*wide-shot: he walks down the street past the glass window – the cashier is crying silently inside.*

&#x200B;

That’s it. I try to click forward, to see if there’s anything else, but that’s it. I watched the whole thing expecting it to be the build up to *something* but no, instead, all I see is something that looks exactly like me drive around town and buy apples and tape. I try to see if I can find the website again to cancel my subscription, but I can’t find anything. I try and look through my history, but it’s not there – in fact, there’s just an empty gap between 1 and 3am.

Whilst it isn’t porn, the technology behind it is still amazing, the person on the screen looks exactly – *exactly –* like me.

I don’t go to work. I watch TV, drink beer, smoke inside. My wife – and she is still my wife – complains.

I don’t listen.

Around 6pm I receive another email.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourgums.mov*

*the camera is focused on the me-that-isn’t-me sat at a table. he’s answering questions. it’s my voice! my voice! he says he is sorry. he says he does not know, no, he never knew. he is fiddling with something in his mouth. above his teeth. he has never heard that name before. he says if they insist but it’s not like he’ll like it. the voice behind the camera laughs.*

*close-up of his mouth: there is a thick, black hair protruding from his gum, just above his teeth, and he is trying to wiggle it loose. it isn’t working. until. until it does, and he pulls out a knot of tangled hairs from his the pink of his gum, and they keep coming and coming and coming until there’s nearly a foot of hair, and with each tug it wobbles his front two teeth a little.*

*he says this has never happened to him before. the voice behind the camera laughs again.*

&#x200B;

I don’t sleep that well that night. Something about the videos has unsettled me. They’re *too* realistic, and, watching that fake-me fiddle with his gums made my mouth hurt. I say nothing to my wife when she comes in, make no effort to tidy the take-away boxes from the table. She looks at me for a long, long time, as if something is building up inside her, some thought or opinion about me she’s always wanted to tell me, and I watch as it almost bursts out her lips – and then, nothing.

I hear something looking through our bins as I try to sleep. A raccoon? Someone homeless? They disappear when I get up to look.

The notification wakes me up: another video. I try to reply to the address that’s sending me these, telling them I want them to stop, but the email bounces back. I have no choice but to watch.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourtrash.mov*

*the me-that-can’t-possibly-be-me is eating at a new table. but the whole table is covered in trash, dirt, empty cans, pizza boxes, rotting fruit, bones, tiny crawling things etc. etc. there are flies buzzing aimlessly about. he is shovelling as much as he can in his mouth, coffee grounds spill down his chin and he coughs. he keeps looking to the left of the camera after swallowing. he winces, pulls something from his mouth: a razor.*

*he has bitten a razor.*

*his blood is dark and thick, and mixes with the coffee grounds that dribble down his chin so that it looks lumpy and black. it coats his shirt, and his hands as he attempts to wipe his face.*

*he looks to the left of the camera again, and continues eating.*

&#x200B;

At this point I consider deleting my email account. Something is *wrong* here, there is something in these videos that’s beyond unsettling. I don’t remember pulling half those facial expressions, and his reactions are just like mine. It’s too real.

That’s *my* wince. That’s the wince of pain I know I do when I stub my toe, or stand on a thumbtack, or bite my tongue.

But when I get up to fix myself a drink I find my wife’s car gone, and I know that she’s with him, with this guy she’s fucking, and I feel a stab of self-loathing that goes so deep it pierces my stomach and makes me retch.

I watch the video again.

Evening comes.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyouranger.mov*

*he is carrying a bunch of grapefruit in his arms in the street. a small, old man bumps into him and the fruit go flying. they make this wet pop as they hit the floor, and in the noise you can hear the fibres that held the fruit together tear. the man is knocked over. the-me-that-looks-too-much-like-me sees someone nearby drinking from a thermos, and, grabbing it, empties the scalding water all over the fallen man’s face.*

*close-up: the-me-that-shouldn’t-be-me spits on him, and winks at the stunned crowd watching. the fallen man moans, and spasms.*

&#x200B;

I don’t know why, but I sort of *like* this one. The noise of the fruit is so satisfying, so visceral, and there’s something triumphant about the way fake-me snatches the boiling water and pours it over the man. Fake-me is in control.

That evening my wife tells me that she doesn’t think she ever loved me, not like the way she loves her new man, and that come to think of it I’m not much of a man at all. She says this whilst I try and wipe ketchup from my shirt, but only succeed in getting some on the couch.

When she goes to bed upstairs I watch *yourfaceyouranger.mov* over and over again.

I doze.

With my eyes half-open, the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me winks at the camera.

My heart gets faster. I pretend to be asleep, and keep my eyes open just a sliver.

&#x200B;

*fake-me walks away from the crowd, right up to the camera. knocks on my screen a few times with his knuckles. it sounds like glass. he watches through the screen, smiling. his eyes are on me, I’m sure of it. he pushes his face against the camera, against my screen, and stares right at me.*

*there is something behind those eyes, behind that face.*

*something dark, and waiting.*

*he keeps watching me.*

&#x200B;

I think he knows I’m awake.

We stay like that until morning.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourneighbour.mov*

*he knocks on mrs. tay’s door. he is holding an apple, and tape. she invites him in. he enters, the camera follows. in one movement he stuffs the apple in mrs. tay’s mouth and forces her to the ground where he binds her arms and legs with tape. someone from off camera hands him a hammer.*

*wide-shot: mrs. tay struggles on the floor. the-me-that-watched-me looks through her records, puts one on. it’s old and slow and the vinyl crackles as he drags her into the basement. the video continues for half an hour more, until the vinyl has finished and there is just a loop of a faint crackle, and then there are two thuds, a snap, and it ends.*

&#x200B;

I can see someone’s car I don’t recognise in my driveway. It looks expensive.

I go to investigate, but can’t find anyone near it, and so I decide to go and check on Mrs. Tay. I stumble down the street in my dressing gown, face covered in patches of stubble, and knock on her door. No-one answers.

Bill Roberts walks past, and I wave at him.

“Seen Mrs. Tay today Bill?”

He shakes his head. I can tell he’s trying not to react to how I look, trying to be polite.

“Haven’t seen her in a week or so Michael.”

A pause. He’s finding the right words – I can tell.

“You doing okay? You don’t look so good.”

“Never better.”

The combination of emotions I’m feeling is hard to put into words. I am elated; there is a version of me, online, who is in control, and is acting.

I am, also, terrified. Whatever it is on that screen knows about me, knows something about my life. I don’t know if it is here, in this reality, or if it is just peering in. Either option makes my chest tight.

I’ve drunk the house dry, and have to make several trips to stock up on liquor. I even call a few old contacts and manage to get some pills, although I promise myself I’ll only take them when things get really, really bad.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourtrial.mov*

*the shortest video so far. the-me-i-wish-was-me pushes against his jaw, probing. slowly, surely, he slides his hand under the skin of my face, until I can see the outline of my fingers under the skin, like five giant malformed veins. he wriggles the fingers and the skin comes away from my face, my ring finger emerges from my eyelids. he pulls the hand out and it is covered in some sort of embryonic fluid.*

*he winks at the camera.*

*(at me?)*

&#x200B;

I try the same thing that evening after I’ve shaved, pushing my fingers into my face as if the skin is going to slip and I’ll be able to do what he did, but nothing happens. My long nails cut the tender, freshly-shaven skin, and I end up just moving my face the conventional way; I smile, then frown, then stick out my tongue, then puff out my cheeks.

Once I’m convinced my face still works, I go to bed.

I think my wife sneaks him in the back door: her lover, her casanova.

I can hear them fuck, I think. I can’t wait for morning, can’t wait for a new .mov. I watch *yourfaceyourtrial.mov* on repeat to help me sleep, and when *he* is convinced I’m asleep he comes right up to the camera again, but this time he fiddles with the edges, as if testing the boundaries.

&#x200B;

*his breathing gets deeper, lustier, he cannot find a way out, so he just watches, cycling through expressions the way I did, convinced that I am asleep.*

*(am I?)*

When I wake up, there is a note from my wife telling me that she’s moving in with him for a while.

There is a voicemail from work telling me I’m fired, and that there’ll be no severance pay.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourjunkies.mov*

*he (I?) finds a couple of junkies on the outside of town. he shows them a huge stack of cash and they both nod. they have about 6 teeth between them and walk with a pronounced stoop, taking him to an abandoned building on the edge of town.*

*he says go in ahead of me I’ll be right in. they pause for a while, trying to work out what the catch is, why this seemingly average guy would offer all this cash up front, but he hands them both small foil packages and they quickly dash inside.*

*as before, he slowly slips his hand under the skin of his face, working it up and up and up, until both hands are completely under the skin –*

*the camera pans down, to the rusty gate that borders the property.*

*he hangs something from the gate, before walking down the overgrown path into the house.*

*it takes me a while to realise that the thing hanging from the gate is a face.*

*my face.*

*like a mask, the mouth and eyes are empty, and the skin flaps like a heavy flag in the breeze.*

*there is the sound of cars driving past every few minutes – then, two noises like grapefruit bursting, fibrous and wet and sudden*

*he walks back down the path, and puts the face back on.*

&#x200B;

I do not manage to see what lies under that face, but I desperately want to.

I think my hair is falling out.

I take a long walk around the block. When I return I find my wife staring at my laptop as if she’s seen the devil. She turns to me, slowly.

“What the *fuck* is this, Michael?”

The laptop is positioned behind her back, so I can see the screen and her at once. I remember the contents of *yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* and start to panic, if that fell into the wrong hands, with no context-

“I can explain – the videos, they’re not me, all of the places, the situations, they’re fake, I think-“

She shakes her head.

“What situations? Jesus. Michael - it’s just hours and hours and hours of footage of you whispering to the camera. It’s just your face. What’s fake about that?”

I can tell she’s a little scared, her disgust at me slowly morphing into something uglier, nastier. She takes a couple of steps back, as if seeing me for the first time. Behind her I can see the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me smiling at the camera on screen.

The footage is paused, but he’s still moving, closer and closer to the camera, his eyes wide and with a rigor-mortis smile – a smile as if he’s just learned how to control the musculature of his face perfectly – and he’s holding a finger to his lips.

*Shh.*

She takes another step back. I try and warn her but no words come. Instead I’m frozen in fear, seeing the fake-me grow closer and closer to the camera, to the screen as her backs turned and-

He’s pushing against the glass of the screen, trying to find a weak point, a crack that will allow him to move from his reality into ours-

She can’t take it anymore, she turns around and without looking at the screen she picks my laptop up and smashes it on the floor.

“You’re sick.”

She leaves.

The thought of the screen smashed for some reason terrifies me. It’s as if whatever barrier was between me and that *thing* is broken, and although I can’t see anything I feel him leaking into our world, like the soft hiss of gas through a broken pipe, or air escaping a valve.

I take the laptop to be fixed – pay extra to make it happen as fast as possible.

As soon as the screen is fixed I take it home, desperate to turn it on, to see if there are any new videos – to check on the old ones.

I try loading *yourfaceyourpurchase.mov* – the first video I was sent.

A familiar scene plays, except there’s no fake-me. It’s the exact same footage, I’m sure of it, but the me-that-isn’t-me isn’t there at all. The cashier still weeps silently, but it’s not due to any version of me scaring her.

I try loading *yourfaceyouranger.mov.*

The same. The exact same video but the fake-me isn’t there. The man still falls over, coffee is still poured on his face, the crowd still reacts – but there’s no *me.*

*Yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* is now just footage of two junkies walking to a crackhouse, and entering it. They still don’t leave, but there is no face on the gate. Nothing. No sign that I was ever there.

The house suddenly feels so empty.

I can hear the faint *tap-tap-tap* of the branches against the upstairs window. The gurgling of the drain. The way the old wood creaks ever so slightly with age.

I am alone.

And I know then that the reason he’s not on the screen because he’s here.

With me.

As I feel sweat start to run down my back, I receive one final email.

&#x200B;

*yourfaceyourturn.mov*

*wide-shot: me, but the* ***real*** *me this time. alone. the room is full of trash, rotting food, empty beer bottles, liquor bottles smashed on the floor, pill bottles, crumpled clothes. the* ***real*** *me holds up a hand, waves it.*

*this is live. this is real time. this is happening. now.*

*the room is dark. objects are obscured. in shadow.*

*something moves behind the window.*

*a curtain rustles.*

*bottles clink.*

*he is in here, somewhere.*

*watching.*

*waiting.*

*I am alone with myself,*

*& I have all the time in the world.*

nosleep,I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying,"Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. 

I slept for a few hours, I don’t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It’s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it’s hard to say.

I checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there’s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. 

I hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could’ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.

“How can I help you sir?” she asked. 

I froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. “Where are we? Why does it look like we’re flying over an ocean?”

She wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. “Sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.”

“I, uh, OK, thank you,” I said.

After she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.

It hadn’t changed. 

I had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn’t changed at all?  

I opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.

They never did.

I tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. “Yes?” she asked. 

“Do you know how long until we land?” I asked.

She narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant said it would be about another hour.”

I shook my head in confusion. “That flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should’ve landed already.”

She stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. 

“Sir, I’m going to ask you to calm down, or I’ll be calling the Captain.”

I told him that wouldn’t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. 

The flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I’ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. 

I’ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they’ve all told me that they’re expecting to land in an hour or so. 

Around three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. 

“Sir, the seatbelt sign is on,” one said. “Please remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We’ll be landing in about an hour.”

I’d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn’t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. 

I shot a look around before unrolling it. 

It said, “Are you stuck too?”

I pulled out a pen and wrote “Yes. It’s been thirty hours.”

I folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. 

It’s been twenty minutes since then. I don’t know why, but I don’t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn’t matter. I have to do *something*. I’ll update you all with whatever happens next.

nosleep,The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide. I think I’m going to need more than a guide.,"How it started: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ci94do/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app



So much has happened in the last 24 hours. I’m so stressed and I’ve barely slept since I discovered that Jamie was missing. It’s starting to make me feel a little twitchy. But I thought I’d better update you guys. 

I was overwhelmed by all the suggestions you gave me and have taken more than a few of them on board. I’m definitely going to be getting a huge planter full of sage for the balcony and I did spill a little salt in my doorway. I’m sorry to disappoint but that didn’t help at all. 

There’s nothing I’m following quite like Mrs Hemming’s rules. I’ve followed them to the letter so far, and lo and behold I’m still alive. That’s not to say it hasn’t been tough. Il start from the beginning. 




I was going crazy. And a few hours after my last post Jamie still hadn’t returned. He had been gone for almost 24 hours. His work have called me multiple times. I don’t know what to say so I just keep ghosting the calls. 

I was bang in the middle of the danger time when I decided checking the lift had to be my first step. But I wasn’t going to break that rule. 

I waited. I waited desperately for 3.34 to come and I’m ashamed to say that when it did I remained paralysed to our sofa for almost half an hour before I found the nerve to leave the flat. It was 4.02 when I finally reached the lift. 

The lift in this building is old and rickety. It hasn’t been updated in a very long time and has likely been here as long as the building. It’s big, clunky buttons stared back at me as I glared at them, hoping for some sort of answer or clue. My heart thumped and I was overcome with a feeling of dread but nothing came of any of it. It was hopeless. 

I stepped inside the lift, rode it up and down a few floors and searched the entire perimeter with a phone torch for anything I could find. I found nothing. Jamie had completely disappeared. 

Sobbing and exhausted I rode back to floor 7 and turned my key in flat 42, the perfect home that felt anything but home at that point. 

I sat at the cheap flat pack dining table we’d managed to put together on move-in day and cried. My hands shaking as I held my phone. 

I was flitting between reading all your comments and contemplating calling the police for an hour. But I decided to call my friend Georgia instead. I needed a real person here, things were so crazy I wasn’t sure the police would be able to help with what little information I had. But I knew I needed to sound it out with someone.

Il spare you the details again, but I told her everything. She promised she’d be with me in the late morning, she had to take her younger brother to school. 

I waited anxiously. Not before arming every room exactly as advised. Before I knew it I looked at the clock and it was 8.23, I had around half an hour until the postman was due to show up. 

There was no way I was missing him today. I stood by the door looking vacantly at the wood, like someone in a film who was possessed. The exhaustion was really setting in but Jamie was all I could think of. Pure adrenaline was keeping me standing. 

At 8.52 I opened the door. The next two minutes were the longest of my life but when I saw him a wave of relief swept my entire body. 

Right on cue, 8.54 the postman, Ian Flanders stood in front of me, a smile that barely hid his concern covering his younger than expected face. He didn’t look old enough to have been the postman for over 35 years but I was too  distracted by the answers that I needed from him to care.

“You must be the new tenant.” He stated, but in a way that it sounded like a question. I struggled with my answer, so I got straight to the point.

“Mrs Hemmings left me a note, she said to speak to you if - “

“Can I come in dear? I think we need to chat.”

I ushered Ian in, my hands still shaking as I flapped them in the direction of the sofa, gesturing for him to sit down. I shoved the now slightly crumpled note into his lap and waited. 

“I’m glad Prue still thinks that highly of me. I will miss that old girl.” He said with a coy smile as he reached the end of the note. 

“Can you help me or not?” I had no time for his ego trip over a moved on neighbour. 

“I can help. But I can’t stop for long so it’ll have to be quick. I’ve walked these halls delivering the post for 40 years. I’ve seen it all, everything Prue’s mentioned and more. What do you need to know?” He said.

Ian was nothing like what I expected. The note made me feel like he was going to be a kindly, old grandad type figure, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Postman Ian spoke with a thick city accent, and wore a heavy gold chain around his tattooed neck. He had dyed his greying hair boot polish black.

His demeanour was thankfully non threatening but extraordinarily cocky. He was the sort of man I imagined in a betting shop, rubbing his grubby hands on notes as he bragged over a win. 

He didn’t ask as he lit a cigarette in my living room. I didn’t question it, we would usually smoke outside but I wasn’t going to argue over technicalities. I grabbed a bowl for the ash and lit one too. 

“Let’s start with the things in the lift. My boyfriend is missing and he took the lift at quarter past 3 over 24 hours ago. We hadn’t got this note yet. I haven’t heard from him since. I need to get him back.” I barked at him as if the louder I spoke the more I could influence his answer. But nothing prepared me for what he said. 

His skin turned pale and his harsh looking face became more sympathetic as he explained. 

“He’s dead, love. Forget about him now. Only one person has ever come back from the lift at that time of night and it was Prue herself. After witnessing it. Those creatures ripping their victim apart. Poor Prue was traumatised. Your boy is gone, let go and follow the rules.” He was blunt but I could tell he felt sorry for me. 

“There must be something I can do!” I pleaded.

“There are things I’ve heard to bring back those who are lost but I’ve never seen solid proof they work. It would be irresponsible of me to tell you to do something that might get you killed too. It’s nice here, honest, just get over him and live the status quo. Sorry if I sound harsh, I don’t mean to, but you seem like a decent young lady and I don’t want to see you go too soon.”

I asked about what Mrs Hemmings had seen in the lift and if they were sure it happened to all who entered it. I refused to believe that Jamie was dead. There had to be something I could do and if I knew what I was dealing with I could be better prepared. 

“It was awful what happened. I wasn’t there, but this is what I was told. 

Little Lyla was such a cute kid. She used to open the door and give me a tip when I delivered the post. She was Prue’s granddaughter. Lyla was her sons little girl and that night She was staying over for the first time. Prue finally felt confident that she could protect Lyla from all the strange things that happen here...

She was wrong. Little Lyla had a problem with sleepwalking. And she took a trip into the hallway at half 1 in the morning, Prue took a little too long to notice the sound she had heard was the front door and by the time she reached the lift she saw the creatures dragging Lyla’s limbs away from her body. She tried to fight them, even killed one, but she couldn’t save the little girl.” 

I was hysterical, imagining Jamie’s fate.

“What are the creatures? Have you ever actually seen them.” I asked.

“No one really knows what they are love. They’re something to do with the building and all its quirks, no ones ever seen them elsewhere. We don’t know where they came from, just that they’re here. 

I’ve seen them a few times over the years, usually when new neighbours have left biscuits down for their cats and dogs or haven’t disposed of food waste properly. 

They’re curious little creatures. Mostly harmless out of the hours Prue warned you about, but if they’re fed they can become quite viscous looking for more food. 

That’s why you have to bin all your scraps, or hide them or pack them or whatever. Just don’t leave them out and don’t use the lift at those times and you’re safe from the creatures. 

They’re a little smaller than humans, but they’re a similar shape, they come with grotesque rodent like features, and are far larger than any rodent could be. Like rodent children I suppose. They have two sharp rows of teeth per jaw and are consistently hungry. 

When they eat they crunch down in a violent and disgusting way, dripping spittle everywhere, Prue said she could hear her granddaughters bones shatter in those jaws.” He went pale at the thought of that, but continued.

“When they first arrived in the building there were hundreds, it caused pandemonium amongst the residents. We lost the residents of more than 30 of the individual homes. But the residents fought back and managed to kill all but the strongest minority of them. 

The creatures left over were incredibly dangerous and seemingly impossible to eradicate, so the residents struck a deal. A deal that they will be left unharmed and allowed to live in the building in return for the residents safety at all times, but if anyone wanders into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33am they are fair game. 

This timeframe is the period the creatures are at their most frenzied and restricting them to the lift was safer for all parties. God help anyone who encounters them during those hours.

They’ve been here ever since, claimed lots of unsuspecting people avoiding the stairs, but nothing like when they first arrived. A few got put down for not holding up their end of the bargain but we haven’t had an incident outside the lift in years. Count yourself lucky you missed that crisis. 

Everything here’s pretty peaceful right now. I’m sorry about your boyfriend. I really have to go, I’m late for my round.” He scrawled his phone number on a bit of paper and handed it to me. “Emergencies only, I don’t like to be bothered.”

“You can’t go! The note said you would help me!” I exclaimed.

“And I will!” He snapped back, “when there’s something I can help with. I can’t resurrect your boyfriend and I don’t like to be late delivering the post. I will see you soon love.”

I was in shock, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I couldn’t believe he was leaving me after the information overload and the small ray of hope he had lit inside me and then squashed. 

“I’ll call the police!” I shouted, desperate to feel as if I was solving this somehow.

“You can try if you want.” Ian sighed, as he opened the door to leave. “It just aggravates the creatures, and it isn’t going to bring your boy back. Mr prentice hates it when police come too, if you want to get any sleep in the next week then I’d avoid it. Wait a week, report him missing and learn to adapt to life here love, or you’ll be dead in days.”

And with that he shut the door behind him. I opened it again, I had so much more to ask, but he was gone, no sign of him anywhere in the corridor. 

Maybe it was me losing my mind, I might be imagining all these things. But no matter how much I willed it the note was still there. And Jamie still wasn’t.




Georgia arrived not long after Ian had left. I, of course, asked if she had seen him in the corridor, to try and affirm to myself that he was real, but she hadn’t. She looked at me worried, and held me as I sobbed and told her what the postman had said about Jamie and the creatures. 

I wasn’t sure she believed me. Even as she read the note she looked skeptical. If she was skeptical I wouldn’t have blamed her, but she had always been supportive. She sat with me for hours while I just sobbed, heartbroken. I was so conflicted as to what do to. It felt insane that I hadn’t contacted anybody, but this note had turned out to be accurate so far and if the postman was to be trusted then I should wait. 

Georgia had been my best friend for many years, she stuck up for me when I was too scared to do it for myself and had always been the brave one of the two of us. I felt safe around her, so after hours of crying and despairing at the way my life had changed in a matter of days I finally decided to take a nap. It was early evening and Georgia was watching some tv. Just there for me if I needed her.

Despite the deprivation, I struggled to fall asleep, I tried to imagine Jamie’s arms around me but it became a more painful reminder that they probably never will be again. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of staring at the damp patch on ceiling I drifted off. 

About three hours ago, I woke up, staring at the goddamn damp patch on the ceiling and could hear chatting in the living room. I jumped out of bed and walked towards it.

Georgia was on the sofa, with a middle aged looking woman, both nursing a cup of tea in the matching mugs that Jamie had got me as a move in present. My blood boiled but it wasn’t their fault, I cleared my throat to get their attention. 

“Oh Katie! This is Natalia, she lives upstairs. We got chatting so I made her a cup of tea. I hope you don’t mind.” I looked at the dark haired woman on the sofa, drinking tea from my cup and nodded. Georgia was a sociable idiot with no understanding of when to not be herself. I wasn’t going to lament her for it right now. It was her coping. 

“Of course. Hi Natalia, what flat do you live in?” I tried my very best to be polite. I would have to discuss not bringing people into my home mid tragedy with Georgia after she had left but until then I would be neighbourly.

“Flat 71. It’s so nice to meet you, you have a lovely home.” Natalia responded, her lips curled at the corners into a smile that wasn’t replicated in her eyes or the rest of her facial expression. She looked at me smugly, with full knowledge that I was aware of the implications of what she had just said.

The rules...

The flat number....

*every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*

Prue’s warning echoed in my mind and I couldn’t take my eyes off Natalia. Something really was off about her. I looked at Georgia sat on the sofa next to her and noticed her sweating. Anyone in the uk knows that it’s been a hot for few days but this was beyond just the ambient temperature. Her entire body was dripping. 

Suddenly, she began to pant. Natalia’s eyes were locked to mine just like the window cleaners had been. Nothing happened before with the cleaner, except this time the rule had been broken. She was already in the flat. 

Georgia started to scream as her skin blistered and charred. Her hair fell from her scalp as the skin flaked and melted away from every inch of her. She was being burned alive without a flame in sight. She scratched frantically at her own melting face, digging into the exposed raw flesh. The sound a person makes when they burn alive is like no other. That will never leave me. 

I screamed and screamed but no one came to my door. I tried to grab my phone to call postman Ian but the wooden surface I had set it down on burned my fingers to the touch and forced me to recoil. She was going to set the whole flat alight. 

My actions needed to be quicker than a phone call. 

I grabbed hold of the large knife I had set down on the side earlier when weaponising, the handle blistered my fingers instantly but I didn’t care, I needed to get her out now and help Georgia if I could. I ran towards the dark haired lady, sweat dripping from my brow the closer I got and plunged the knife into Natalia’s throat. She gripped it and fell to the floor. 

She didn’t bleed like a normal human. Her insides were black, she was still moving, and I figured it probably wouldn’t be long before she stood right back up and tried again. So I dragged her into the hallway ready to bolt the door. 

As we reached the entrance of the corridor one of the cats was waiting, hissing at her semi conscious body, I caught her eyes fixate on it as I dumped her on the floor. I grabbed the cat, pulled him inside, wincing as it’s skin caused more burns up my lower arms, shut the door and watched through the peep hole. She got up and held her hand to the wound, cauterising it and walking off towards the lift. As if she hadn’t been injured at all. 

I’d dropped the cat by that point but every bit of naked skin it had touched throbbed and burned for at least an hour. 

Georgia hadn’t been as lucky as Natalia with injury recovery. I anonymously called an ambulance for her. I couldn’t believe it but she was still breathing. She was badly burned and her life wouldn’t be the same again but she was alive. And for that I was grateful. 

It sounds awful but I left her at the park across the road from the building. With no phone or i.d. She’s my best friend and I want to be there but if I own up to involvement in injuries that bad they’ll suspect me, and I lose the already slim chance that Jamie might be saveable. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about Georgia, but she’s alive. I won’t believe Jamie isn’t until I see it. 

So now I’m alone again, in the flat, conflicted about what to do. 

I want to leave. So badly. But this was mine and Jamie’s first home together. If he’s alive, and I can save him then I want it to be here for him to come back to... and if he’s dead, and the postman is right then I don’t know if I can leave his memory behind. 

There’s only one person I think could help me right now. So tonight I’m going to do some research, hunt down an address and tomorrow morning I’m going to visit Prudence Hemmings.

nosleep,"Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the start of the pandemic. Three months ago, we lost contact with him.","Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the beginning of 2020. He said the world was about to end and when we didn’t believe him, he told us to wake up. It was raining that day. I remember focusing on the water hitting the windowpanes while my sister tried to change Dad’s mind. I knew it was no use. He was too stubborn to listen to anyone except maybe Donald Trump. WHO had just declared that COVID-19 had pushed the world into a pandemic. Dad wanted us to join him and when we told him no, he called us brainwashed.

He purchased the land before I was born. Only because of the dilapidated military facility that came with it. It was abandoned sometime in the 60s, I think. My sister was there from the beginning, even before Dad’s obsession pushed Mom away. It’s hard for me to imagine what he was like back then. Mom says he was a gentleman. But they married young, and a person can change a lot during those years. And so did Dad. All I remember from him during childhood are the weekends at the bunker. Constantly renovating it and stockpiling it with everything he would need to survive down there.

We couldn’t stop him. He wasn’t the best Dad, not even a good one, but it was sad to see him go all the same. He was excited, even though he thought that civilization was about to collapse. I guess that happens when you’ve spent your entire adult life preparing. We had to set up an old radio to keep in touch with him. He didn’t trust mobile phones. We didn’t hear from him often, just once a month, sometimes less. The last time he radioed in, he said he had found a hidden door. He was going to see where it went. That was three months ago.

“You think he’s okay?” my sister said. “He wasn’t in great health. I *told* him.”

We sat in the car, on our way to check up on him, driving through the heatwave.

“His radio might have broken down,” I said. “Let’s not assume the worst.”

But I felt worried too. There was something strange about that hidden door, and his tone when he mentioned it. It didn’t sit right with me. But maybe it was just the heat and the endless desert around us that played tricks on my mind. I couldn’t really tell.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was dark when we arrived. Dad’s truck stood where he had left it, beneath some tarp that blew in the chilly, sand-carrying wind. We turned on our flashlights and walked to the cliff above the bunker. The steel door was made to withstand a nuclear blast. Luckily, I owned the only spare key in existence. Before I used it, I banged on the door as hard as I could and yelled for Dad. I worried he would mistake us for intruders and shoot us. If he was confused, and if it was dark, it was a real possibility. I banged again and yelled at the top of my lungs:

“Dad, are you there? It’s me, Josh! Eveline is here as well!”

“I don’t think he can hear you,” Eveline said.

I nodded. “Dad! I’m going to open the door now!”

I was seventeen the last time I was here. Back then it was the Muslims that were going to end civilization as we knew it. Before that, it was the Russians. Now it was China. There was always something threatening his beloved freedom, and yet he was never truly free. My sister put her hand on my wrist just as I was about to unlock the door.

“You know,” she said. “Maybe we should just call the authorities after all and–”

“No,” I said. “He’ll fight them.”

I unlocked the heavy door. A rancid smell escaped the darkness inside. It was the odor of death. I recognized it from when Dad tried––and ultimately failed––to learn how to hunt and let a reindeer carcass rot on the property for weeks. My sister had already stopped visiting him by then. I didn’t tell her what the smell reminded me of. She covered her nose with her shirt. We descended the spiral stairs. It creaked for each step we took, almost as if it was about to fall apart.

I tried the light switch at the bottom. The click echoed throughout the long corridor leading to the living area. Nothing happened.

“Hm.” I realized that the batteries, which he charged by the use of an old exercise bike, were dead. That meant he was most likely dead as well. “The generator could be broken,” I said. “But… Maybe you should wait back here, just in case… you know.”

I pointed my flashlight in front of me. The light was too weak to reach the end of the corridor. On the way here I had felt ready. I felt sad, the kind of empty sadness you feel after the death of a parent that was never any good, but I didn’t feel worried. Now, on the other hand, while staring into the dark corridor that I used to run through as a kid… I was afraid. The fear reminded me of how my childhood night terrors used to start. They always crept up on me in the darkness, grew with the grotesque shadows on my bedroom ceiling.

“I’m not letting you go in there alone,” Eveline said. “We stay together.”

We walked into the darkness. The foul smell intensified for every step we took, and so did my heartbeat. I was glad my sister didn’t stay behind. The bunker seemed so much smaller than I remembered it, much more cramped. The asymmetry between my memories and reality made everything feel off somehow, just as if the bunker was merely a model of the real thing. But it wasn’t. I had just grown up.

The Confederate flag greeted us at the end of the corridor. It hung on the concrete wall. It looked pale in the hotspot of the flashlight, almost like a phantom. And, of course, in many ways it was. A ghost from a time long ago. Or perhaps a corpse brought back to life. An abomination. It reminded me of Dad more than anything else.

“You have to be seriously confused to praise freedom as much as Dad and hang that symbol of lesser freedom in the world on your wall,” Eveline said.

“He wanted to protect his freedom so much that he built a prison for himself.” I removed the light from the flag, leaving only darkness. “You bet he was confused.”

We entered the main chamber. It was overfilled with litter and clutter. Empty cans––both the food and beer kinds––lay scattered across the sticky floor. We had to take large steps not to step on any of the trash.

“That’s weird.” Eveline pointed her flashlight at the small dining table. “Look.”

My hair stood up on my neck before I even realized what she meant. The table was set for three people. I didn’t say anything for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing, and just when I was about to speak my sister interrupted me:

“Who the *fuck* was here with him?”

“We don’t know–” I began. “I mean, he might have left the old plates on the table and–”

A sound of something falling to the ground came from one of the other rooms further into the bunker. I pointed my light in its direction but couldn’t see what made it.

“Dad!” I yelled. “It’s me, Josh! You there?”

No response.

“I’m afraid,” Eveline whispered. “Something isn’t right.”

I only vaguely heard what she said. My focus was on something else. Something on the wall on the other end of the room.

“That’s not supposed to be there.” I slowly walked toward it. “That must have been what he talked about over the radio.”

Dad had hacked away a layer of concrete, for whatever reason, and uncovered a rusty, metal door behind it. It stood ajar. A lukewarm, musty breeze came out of it. My sister walked up to me as I carefully pried the door open with the back of my flashlight. I felt my heart in my throat. I could hear my sister begging for us to leave, almost in tears. But I needed to know what was behind that door. It was imperative to understand what had happened here. I needed to know. I needed closure.

“What in heavens name…” Eveline looked over my shoulder. “Why is this here?”

Behind the door was a room about the size of a broom cupboard. It was unremarkable except for a circular hole in the middle of the floor. I shone my light into it, but I couldn’t see the bottom. Just as I thought it was big enough for a person, my sister said:

“Do you think he fell?”

Drops of sweat from my forehead fell down the pit. I felt dizzy and stepped back, afraid I would fall inside. My sister picked up a can filled with some rotten beans and threw it down the hole. It clattered against the walls as it bounced from one side to another. The sound faded away until we couldn’t hear it anymore. There was no indication it touched down at the bottom. I stretched out my hand and held it above the opening.

“It’s warm,” I said. “The air, I mean.”

“Maybe he fell.” Eveline stepped back, almost as if she were convinced. “Can we please get out of here?” She reached for my arm. “We can return with the police. Please… Josh?”

“It wasn’t dark when Dad found this,” I said. “He would have seen the hole.”

“Josh? Please.”

“Just give me a moment to think.” I walked toward the hallway that led to the other rooms, desperately hoping to find him. For some reason, it was important for me to see him. To be able to leave without wondering. I needed to know that he was truly dead. “I just want to–” I stopped myself after I accidentally pointed the flashlight on the floor in the middle of the hallway, revealing a pair of feet. “I think I found him!” I ran up to the body.

“Wait!” Eveline yelled and reluctantly followed me to avoid being left alone.

It wasn’t Dad. I screamed upon the realization. My mind couldn’t comprehend what I had just seen. I spun around and tried to run away, completely acting on instinct, and crashed into my sister. She grabbed me, kept me still, and as she looked behind me, down at the dead body on the floor, she began to cry while her hands trembled uncontrollably against my shoulders.

“Oh my God,” she said. “How… how is it possible? It’s you!”

“Let’s get a fuck out of here,” I said. “Move!”

There was nothing that could explain this, and the more my mind tried to––moving in an endless loop doing so––the dread grew inside me. I only got a glimpse of the body before I panicked, but my sister was right. The half-rotten face was the same as mine, with a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead.

We stumbled our way through the living area, tipping over chairs and kicking cans all over the place, and just as we were about to get out of the mess a familiar voice echoed through the hallway we had just escaped.

“Josh!”

It was Dad. We both stopped in our tracks.

“Is that you? Josh!”

“Dad?” I yelled back. “What the fuck is going on here?”

“Don’t worry!” It sounded like he was at the other end of the bunker, possibly inside the storeroom. “I killed the son of a bitch, put a bullet right between his eyes!”

“Come out from there!” I yelled. “We have to leave, it’s not safe here!”

Silence.

“Something is wrong,” Eveline said. “I don’t think–”

“Dad!” I yelled. “Come out!”

“I can’t move!” Dad said. “I’m stuck under a shelf! I’ll need your help, son!”

I turned to my sister. “Go back up. I’ll get that old bastard out of there. We’ll be right behind you, okay?”

“Think, Josh!” Eveline begged. “You think he’s been stuck under a shelf for–”

I should have listened, but even after what we had just seen I just couldn’t bring myself to even consider something as outlandish as what my sister was suggesting. It was simply too far-fetched, too unbelievable to penetrate all my layers of presumptions about reality. It couldn’t be, it just couldn’t. Hence, I ran back to the hallway, yelling for my sister to get back up to the surface and wait for us there.

“I’m coming, Dad!”

I only slowed down to carefully step over the corpse that bore my face. Perhaps, I thought, it was just a coincidence. A burglar that just happened to look like me. After all, the face had begun to rot. It wasn’t obviously me. I felt stupid and I almost convinced myself that it was just my childhood fear of the dark coming back to life down here. And then, just as I was about to walk past the small composting toilet that stood inside a small room at the end of the hallway, I stopped. Shivers spread across my entire body, paralyzing me. Dad sat on the toilet. His gun still hung from his trigger finger and his brain was splattered across the wall behind him. He had his journal in his lap, covered in blood.

“Josh!” Dad yelled from the darkness. “Help me!”

I was frozen in place, both by fear and confusion, unable to make any decisions.

“Come on, Josh!” Dad kept yelling. “I need your help, son!”

My mind was racing. There was no way of knowing who was who. When I heard Dad’s voice yelling for help while watching his dead body, nothing but absolute terror revibrated inside me. I slowly reached for the journal in Dad’s lap and grabbed it, hoping it would shed some light on the situation. I was just about to open it when my sister screamed. I ran back, this time jumping over my doppelgänger's body, and found her looking at something at the corner of the main chamber.

“I told you to–” I said, but changed my mind. “Are you okay, what happened?”

“It’s–” she cried. “It’s me.”

Crawled up in the corner was her naked, dead body. Her head had been twisted in such a way that the neck had been broken.

“There’s something seriously wicked going on here,” I said. “Dad shot himself in the head, a long time ago by the looks of it, and yet he keeps yelling for help. Let’s get back to the car, now!”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

We drove away from the bunker as fast as we could, leaving whatever was still alive down there yelling for help. My sister insisted on staying at my place for a few days. I didn’t mind having her around. We shared an experience no one else could relate to, and we needed each other to overcome the trauma.

It took a day for me to build up the courage to open Dad’s journal. It began with his usual deranged conspiracy theories. I flipped past them. At the end, he had only made short notes.

&#x200B;

*Found a hidden door.*

&#x200B;

*Deep pit, possible the remains of some old black project.*

&#x200B;

*Eveline and Josh woke me up. A “surprise visit”. Didn’t hear them enter. Strange.*

&#x200B;

*Had dinner with them, something seems off.*

&#x200B;

*It isn’t them! They tried to make me* \[Illegible\]*!!!*

&#x200B;

*God help me, it isn’t them!*

&#x200B;

*I shot the son of a bitch right between the eyes!*

&#x200B;

*Hiding in the bathroom now, this will probably be my last entry.*

&#x200B;

*God forgive me.*

&#x200B;

Chills went down my spine as I read the last entry on the blood-drenched page.

&#x200B;

*I never got the other one. She’s still out there somewhere. I only got one bullet left. I won’t allow her to do that abhorrent thing to me. Forgive me.*

&#x200B;

My sister has been cooking for hours. She just called for me from the kitchen:

“Josh? Come here, I want to show you something!”

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cinu8u/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app


I didn’t get much sleep last night either. The lack of sleep is making me wonder whether all these things happening are in my mind or not. But I’m reminded every time I see that damn note that it’s all real. 

I spent hours last night searching for anything I could about Prudence Hemmings. If she had lived in a big creepy mansion I imagine she would have been easy to find. But us folk who live in tower blocks aren’t so well documented. No one cares about our lives, no matter how extraordinary.

I found an article about missing person Lyla Hemmings. It suggested that she went missing under the care of her grandmother while playing in the park opposite the flats early in the morning. Interviews with her parents stated that they had both disowned Prudence. 

Despite the many years that had passed since Lyla’s death/disappearance her parents appeared to have remained unforgiving of Prue. There was no mention of her on either of their social media accounts and she appeared to have no involvement with the children they had acquired since. 

Searches for the Hemmings family in the local area were equally dead ends, I looked at link after link, desperate to find something but they all started to blur into one. Until finally I saw something. 

An obituary for Bernard “Bernie” Hemmings, who had fallen from the tower block in unexplained circumstances after being diagnosed with dementia months before his death. I was surprised it hadn’t made bigger news. It had only been about a year. There were no details of where to find them, but his wife Prudence and her sister Bridget were listed as contacts to get find out details of the funeral. 

It’s scary what you can do with the internet these days, but just with those phone numbers I was able to put them into a reverse directory and find an address for Bridget and Tony Bishop, the sister and brother in law that Prudence was supposedly living with.

About 4am I managed to get some sleep, not much though, I was back up and wide awake at around 7am, planning my route and working out my day. I saw a post on social media from one of her relatives that Georgia was identified and is stable. This loosened the knot in my stomach that has been present since I found the note somewhat. 

At 8.50, I opened the door to my flat hoping to see postman Ian. 4 minutes passed and instead of the postman an elderly gentleman made his way down the corridor. He had a walking stick and kind eyes. In his free arm he carried a small plastic bag containing a newspaper and milk, he smiled and said “good morning” as he passed.

I smiled back. He reminded me of my grandad. I imagined him pulling cola cubes from his pocket for his grandkids and shushing them when their parents weren’t looking. A little further down the corridor the old man stopped and turned. He looked me dead in the eyes with a sympathetic expression and spoke.

“No post on a Sunday, if that’s what you were waiting for.” He smiled knowingly and turned to unlock a front door that until shut I couldn’t see the number of. When I saw the door close and the number 48 boldly displayed above the peephole I understood what Prudence had meant. Mr Prentice did seem to be a lovely chap. 

I sat back in my flat and sighed, staring at the various tabs open on my laptop. At about 9.15 the knocking on the balcony door started.

The window cleaner was back.

I didn’t feel half as terrified as I had the first time, if anything, I was just angry. It took every ounce of restraint I had in my tired body not to engage with him, if only to tell him to fuck off. His genuine seeming requests just irritated me. After about 20 minutes of being watched the knocking started to give me a headache, so I grabbed a bag and left the flat.

I decided there was no time like the present. If I was going to turn up on the Bishops’ doorstep looking for her sister because of the freaky flat she’s left behind then I had to get it over with. If the address was old, or the bishops weren’t the people I was looking for then I was going to look stupid whatever time of day I went.

And I couldn’t take the window cleaners eyes anymore. There was something about them, they really do make you want to open that door. 

I looked at the lift as I entered the communal hallway and decided today I would take the stairs. I couldn’t stand to be in a small box that my partner probably died very painfully in. My heart dropped into my stomach just at the sight of it.

The stairs were as grotty as the lift. We’d taken them multiple times on move in day but I hadn’t really taken it in the same way I could now. I thought about the rules and all the strange things happening in this building. I looked at the badly painted numbers on the walls as I reached each landing.

Nothing in this building is simple.

I looked at the numbers. 7, 6, 5 ... 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, G. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation but my legs were in agreement with my mind that I had definitely just descended more than 6 flights of stairs. They’d glitched. 

I looked at the dusty and poorly lit stairwell from the bottom. It seemed dark despite the sun pouring in from the glass panel in the main building doors. The note never mentioned glitchy stairs, maybe I really was losing my mind. 

As I turned to exit the building a woman walked in. She was in her late thirties to early forties and had 2 small children in tow. One boy and one girl. I guessed that they were twins, they were both incredibly blonde, with deep brown puppy dog looking eyes and couldn’t have been any older than 6-7. They were as close to identical as it gets in twins of different genders. I’m not a fan of kids, but they were super cute. 

The lady had a short bob haircut that got longer at the front, it was uniform and dyed a perfectly even auburn colour. I knew it was dyed because her roots were blonde like her kids. She looked as tired as I felt, but she pulled herself together when she saw me, running fingers through s part of her hair that she must have missed how ever early she left this morning. 

“Hi, are you here visiting?” Who opened with, trying to make small talk. 

“No, I just moved in to flat 42, on the 7th floor, I was just leaving actually. Whereabouts are you?” I was desperate to go, I had feared myself up to see Prue but I didn’t want to be rude.

“I’m flat 26, my name’s Terri. This is Eddie and Ellie.” She gestured to the two small children hiding shyly behind her skirt. “Welcome to the block. If you ever need anything please feel free to give me a shout.”

“My name is Katie but people call me Kat too. That’s really kind of you, thank you. I will.... hey, is there something wrong with the stairs?” I stopped myself before going into detail.

“Nothing wrong, they just skip sometimes.” She answered, shrugging. 

“Well I’d love to stop and chat but I actually really need to get going. It was nice to meet you Terri.” I tried to work out what was wrong with the children as I stepped forward to walk away. Still baffled by the stairs.

“By the way, we have a residents committee, you should come to one of our meetings, they’re every Tuesday in alternating flats. This Tuesday is at Molly Jefferson’s place in flat 31, come along. We’d love to have you!” Terri suggested, waving me off. 

I walked out the doors after my encounter with Terri feeling sick. Every minute in this place made the note more real. Every word jumped off the page and into my life. Made it more likely that Jamie was really gone. 

I rode the bus from a stop not far from the flats. It felt like it took and eternity to reach the little suburban area I was looking for. A five minute walk away from the bus stop I got off at and I was staring at a quaint little bungalow, belonging to Bridget and Tony Bishop. 

I knocked on the door. The lady who opened it was unsteady on her feet, she was probably in her 70s, with wispy white hair neatly scraped back into a bun, two strands left hanging that just softened her wrinkled face. She wore a dusty rose coloured dress that hung just below her knees and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. 

“Can I help you?” She asked bluntly.

“My name is Kat. I’m looking for Prudence Hemmings.” I answered, stuttering slightly. 

Her eyes widened slightly.

“Why?” She asked, bizarrely. 

“Is she here? It’s private.” 

The lady ushered me into the house, and sat me down on a sofa, within minutes there was a cup of tea in front of me. She didn’t say anything to me for a while, we just looked at each other. Then she finally broke the silence. 

“I wondered if you’d try and find me. It took me a long time to decide whether to leave that note or not but I decided that you deserved a head start. That’s more than I ever got.”

The woman was Prudence, she was nothing like I had imagined. She seemed tough and hardened and spoke with a mostly blunt tone, she contributed before I could answer.

“Terri called me not long ago. Told me that she had met the new tenant. She said you looked shaken up, and said that my note may not have been enough. I did say I couldn’t fit everything on there. And the stairs didn’t seem too important. The committee wanted to organise a meeting with you on your moving in day but I told them that was intrusive. The whole committee thing always seemed a bit excessive to me anyway.” She spoke flippantly, like it was nothing. 

“It may have been intrusive, but we needed a warning, we spent a night in the place before I found your note! My boyfriend had already left for work at 3.15 and taken the lift.... he didn’t know.” I broke as I told her what had happened. Her face dropped. And so did my hope for Jamie. 

“I’m so sorry... I really don’t know what to say. I thought my note would reach you in time.” She mumbled, her face to the floor, refusing to look at me as tears streamed down my face.

“He’s gone isn’t he. I didn’t want to accept it but I spoke to the postman and your face says all it needs to. The postman said there might be a way I can have him back.” I bit at her, devastated and angry.

“He’s gone. You can’t have him back. What Ian is referring to isn’t what you think. There’s a way to get people back from the lift. But not as themselves. Trust me, I learned the hard way. Once they’re back you can’t reverse it. I’m sorry about your man. But he’s gone forever. Don’t dig into the other way, to be gone forever is luckier than that alternative.” She still wouldn’t look up from the floor.

“What do you mean...”

“I don’t want to talk about it. I said in the note that there are things I’d rather not discuss and I need you to respect that or I won’t be speaking to you at all. Now move on and ask what you need to ask.” Prudence cut me off, I decided not to push the topic further, and moved on to some other things I needed to know.

“What’s the deal with Terri’s kids? They seem sweet and normal.”

“Those little demon creatures are anything but normal.” She answered, wincing slightly at the though of them. “When she went into labour Terri never made it to a hospital. They were the first children ever to be born inside the building and with everything that goes on it’s like something’s rubbed off on them. They’re average children in the daytime, but they never sleep, ever. Poor Terri hasn’t had a days rest since they were born. They also really love to steal birds and rats they find the cats playing with and torment them. Really annoys the cats.” 

As she finished speaking a small hairless cat strutted out from behind an armchair across the room, meowing softly. It brushed its head up against Prue’s exposed legs, leaving scorch marks where it touched. She didn’t react, she reached down and stroked the top of its head, smiling as it purred. 

“And those?” I asked, eyes stuck to her now badly burned legs. 

She chuckled, pulled out a box and lit a cigarette, tapping the top layer of ash into a small silver dish in front of her. She offered me one and I took it gladly. 

“They’ve always been my good friends. I couldn’t leave the building without bringing a part of home with me. This little guy is Damon. He’s seen some things.” She gushed, not taking her eyes off the cat. 

“But where did they come from, why are they everywhere?” I asked, watching in disbelief as her burns subsided. It seemed impossible, but I looked at my arms where I had picked up the cat the night before and there was no evidence it had ever happened. They didn’t even appear sunburnt. 

“No one really knows. They started to appear after the fire, a few years after I’d moved in. It was rumoured that they were the pets of the residents that burned, and that was why they had no fur. But I don’t think that’s true.”

I interrupted.

“I met one of those neighbours last night. She said her name was Natalia. She almost killed my best friend. You’re crazy if you think your note was enough of a warning!” I ranted emotionally.

“Look, girl. If I had made a song and dance about warning you, then you’d have thought me crazy and challenged the rules. You’d have been dead already. Be grateful you got anything. I didn’t. I had to work it all out. Your generation are so spoiled.” She tutted in frustration at me. I was angry, but she was probably right. An elderly lady telling me rat like creatures would kill my boyfriend in a lift would probably have got some laughs from me a few days ago. I stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down, after a while she sighed and started again.

“I think the cats are the neighbours that burned. They’ve never meant any harm and they hiss and run from the imposters that roam the building. Besides, there’s no way there were that many cats living on one floor. 

The imposter people don’t even match up with the residents that died in the fire, none of them look like, or claim to have the same name as the dead. They just claim to live in their flats. I’ve met Natalia before, she left a bad scar on Bernie’s leg from an incident we had, nasty girl. 

Before the fire there was cctv and there was a recording saved of about 15 people marching into the flats and up to that floor about half an hour before the fire started. It was the only evidence found. CCTV wasn’t great in the eighties so they were never identified. And the flames melted the relevant cameras so nothing ever came of it. 

I think the people that entered that night are the ones that ask for sugar. I don’t know any more than that but if you avoid them like I said you don’t need to know more. They hate the cats. I hope your friend survives, but I’ve seen what those people can do so maybe she was better off dead.” Prue carried on stroking Damon. I watched the skin of her fingers melt and twist as they made contact with him.

“What happened to your husband?” 

I asked the question so fast I didn’t have time to consider that this was a topic she had explicitly said she didn’t want to discuss in the note. But I had to know. 

She scowled at me. “I said I didn’t want to talk about that.” She hissed.

“I just lost the love of my life. I need some answers.” I begged.

“What happened to Bernie won’t help you. I know you’d think any deaths in that building would be down to the quirks but this wasn’t. For the most part anyway.

Don’t forget that we had lived there for 35 years, Bernie knew the rules, we knew how to take care of ourselves and have a happy life there. It was our home.”

“I don’t doubt that’s Mrs Hemmings, I’m sorry” I interjected.

“Bernie had dementia. It started about 6 months before he died and he deteriorated very rapidly. Towards the end he started wandering, the doctors said it was common, but in our position it was incredibly dangerous. More times than I can count I pulled him away from the lift just in time.

Along with wandering he was forgetting the rules. He let that smug awful window cleaner in 3 times, thank lord for the big metal pipe I kept by the balcony door, chased him out a treat. Not that anything stops him from coming back. I’m sure you’re already acquainted. 

After all the dangerous situations Bernie was in, by the end he made the smallest and most fatal of errors. 

He left a bowl of food out for Damon at 10am. I was out shopping with Terri and a few of the girls from the committee and when I came back I found one of those awful creatures...” 

Prudence started to cry. I put my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her, after all, I truly knew how she felt. 

“It was eating him.” She sniffed and steadied herself to continue, moving my hand. “I chased the creature away with the same metal pipe I had the window cleaner and pushed Bernie off the balcony. He was heavy but I didn’t want anyone to know what really killed him. It’s teeth..” she shivered “...they made such an awful noise. It reminded me of -“

“Lyla.” I finished her sentence. I hadn’t meant to. I was so invested in her story I couldn’t help it. 

“I gather you spoke with Ian then.” She said sounding resigned. “I never meant to hurt that little girl. I loved her so much.” Tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks. Damon, who was now sat next to her on the sofa, shuffled closer as if to cuddle her. 

“Haven’t you ever been curious about getting her back?” I asked, my mind turning back to the methods hinted at by both Prue and the postman. “I miss Jamie so much. I’d do anything to get him back.”

Her face filled with a look of horror and shame. “Of course I have.” She answered, “which is exactly why I’m telling you not to.” 

But I couldn’t let it go. 

“Surely anything must be better than gone forever?” I pestered. I wish I hadn’t.

Prudence, frustrated, stood up and gestured for me to follow, she lead me outside to the back garden of the bungalow. At the back was a large shed, the kind people used for a man cave or a summer house. It was pretty, the sun shone down on it lighting up the few cobwebs in the corners and making them twinkle. 

Mrs Hemmings was careful to look into both neighbouring gardens to ensure there was no one around before she unlocked the door to the shed. We stepped inside and the first thing to hit me was the smell, it was putrid, like rotting meat. I looked at the floor and covered my nose with my hands, staring back at me was a pool of blood.

I followed the blood with my eyes as Prudence locked us in the shed. Then after I made it past the animal bones I finally saw it.

Just like postman Ian had described.

One of the creatures was watching me, from a heavy duty metal dog cage in the corner of the shed. It looked reinforced but still the metal had chew marks. Their jaws had to be strong to cause that.

That didn’t surprise me looking at it, it’s rodent like nose and beady, yet somehow human like  eyes were nothing compared to the two very visible rows of jagged sharp teeth that lined each gum. Despite its small stature, it was terrifying. 

Prudence opened a drawer in a dusty cupboard across the room and pulled out a can of dog food, she poured the contents into the bowl  and passed the bowl through the feeding hatch. The cage had a safety feature meaning the animal couldn’t access the food until the hatch was locked from the outside. I was grateful for this.

Prue turned to me and spoke. She brushed one of the two strands of hair framing her face behind her ear. Gesturing to the hideous creature she said;

“Kat, I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter, Lyla.”

nosleep,"I have an unusual job. The pay is good, but I really hate the moaning sounds that go with it.","“So,” I croaked, ignoring her wince at my raspy voice, “you’re worried that your dead husband is haunting you when you fuck other men?”

I inhaled a long drag of the cigarette, then took care to blow the smoke *just* far enough from her face to avoid being rude. She didn’t flinch, which meant she thought I had a lot to offer. 

Pretty little thing, she was. Nearly thirty years old, though I’d estimate the age of her modified chest to be about three. Her good looks stemmed mainly from the fact that she’d clearly avoided a lifetime of hard work. I probably would have been equally attractive twenty-five years ago had my twin passions been vanity and stupidity.

This gal was taken care of.

Her expression glazed for just a moment. I noticed.

“No,” she offered timidly, “it’s nothing like that.” She looked up at me with wide eyes that had been conditioned to elicit sympathy. I noticed. 

“It’s just…” she bit her lip. “It’s just that Raymond’s been gone a month – but I don’t think that he’s *gone* gone, you know? I want to know if I should put him behind me, or…” She shed a tear. “It started out small. His favorite sweater would be hanging in the closet, but the next morning, it was lying on the bedroom floor. Not a big deal, you know?” She looked around conspiratorially, despite the fact that no one was in the brightly lit sun porch besides the two of us. 

As if sensing my thought, Sophocles rubbed up against my skirt. I reached down and scratched his ear without turning away from my client. She stared right back at me, looking over the swirling vapor dancing from the teapot’s spout. 

“But then,” she breathed, flushing slightly pink, “I would be, ah, in an intimate moment-”

“Masturbating, or fucking?” I asked bluntly.

Her pink face quickly turned crimson. “Um, the first one. I’d hear a sudden banging on my bedroom door. It would go away whenever I stopped… what I was doing.”

“What makes you think it’s your dead husband?” I pressed her, crushing my cigarette and lighting a new one.

She gazed down at the table. “He would *always* interrupt me. Even if it wasn’t… about anything naughty.” She looked up at me in desperation. “It just *feels* like him. Does that make any sense?” She bit her lip again. I noticed. “But the worst thing was last night. That’s what made me decide that it was time to talk with a… *professional.*”

God, her little pauses and cute blushing were irritating. I really wanted to slap her. 

“Explain,” I ordered cavalierly before taking in that first drag.

A long pull of the cigarette really makes people like her worth it. What was her name? Cindy? She seemed like a Cindy. But the Cindys of the world always scatter from my mind for *just* a few seconds during that first sensual puff. In those moments, I feel so *capable.*

“Last night-”

I coughed. Reality set back in. “Listen, Cindy-”

“It’s Anne-Samantha.”

“You must have jilled off thousands of times in your life-”

“I’m sorry… ‘jilled’?”

“Well, are you a Jack from the waist down?”

She laid a dainty little hand right on her mouth. “Oh… my, no. I’m all Jill, I suppose.”

I grunted. “So what’s so different about jilling off now?”

Her eyes got wide again, but I had learned long ago to suppress the slap-urge. “When I’m alone in bed, I hear breathing. *Only* when I’m alone. It’s unmistakable.”

“Well, how hard are you working?” I asked pointedly.

She dropped the hand from her face. “The breathing is coming from the other side of the room.”

I gave her an unblinking, fixed stare. She returned it.

I finally turned away when a lump of ash fell from my cigarette onto the table. “Here,” I offered, pouring a cup of tea from the pot. I rested my hand on the painted grapefruit and lavender design to hold it steady. “Drink this.”

She took it obediently, blew on it, then took a sip and winced. “Too hot?” I asked sharply.

“Too bitter,” she responded coolly.

“Too bad,” I finished. “Drink the whole cup if you want to see what’s on the other side.”

She sipped as I spoke. “You’ve told me that Raymond’s been gone a month. You’re brokenhearted, but you can’t move on if he’s still here. The shock was terrible, wasn’t it? A hit-and-run while he was crossing the street right in front of your own home. The worst moments of your life were sprinting through the house, knowing what was outside before you saw it. The hope was the worst, because you *knew* that your husband’s broken body would be lying in the street. But the smallest part of you hoped that it wasn’t true, and that *hope* made it hurt so much more. You found him in a gory heap just beyond your front yard, and the future you’d imagined drained away like blood through your fingers. And it was in that exact moment, kneeling in the middle of the street at 7:13 p. m., that you realized your life had been permanently changed to a different path of someone else’s choosing.” I took an aggressive puff of the cigarette and pressed forward. “The sun set while you held his already-cooling hand, and you realized that this would be the first sunset you’d spend knowing he was dead, and that you would end every day with this thought on your mind from now on.”

She blanched. “I never told you that it was at sunset. I never even said it was a car accident.”

I narrowed my eyes at her. “The guilt was more than you expected, because part of you had actually cared about Raymond. Yes, he was old, and *boring,* my God, you would never let him forget it. But he’d felt just so fucking fragile when you crushed his spine with the car that the anger didn’t seem to make sense in the moment.” I blew smoke through my nostrils. “He knew it was you, Cindy. You pulled the car into the driveway and rinsed off the blood so fast that no one even thought to check it for evidence. But *he* knew, and as he lay dying, unable to speak through shattered lungs, he stared at you without hate, malice, or vengeance. It was simple confusion, Cindy. Raymond never considered that you did it for the cash. His dying thought was wondering how he’d somehow been a bad husband, and he felt guilty for not knowing why.”

Her eyes were shimmering with tears that I believed were genuine, but I didn’t give a shit.

Her cup of tea was empty. 

“I was so careful,” she whispered in a pitch that was just below the ‘only dogs can hear it’ threshold. 

I rolled my eyes. “No you weren’t, Sweetie. People are just stupid, and that’s the only reason you’ve gotten away with everything so far. Really, putting $619,138 cash in a briefcase is just *asking* for trouble.”

Her jaw hung in shock. “How could you possibly have known?”

I blew one last long stream of smoke from the cigarette. “If I were in your shoes, Sweetie, I’d be much more worried about how much poisonous oleander you just had with your tea.”

She slammed her hands on the table and grabbed the edges so hard that the empty cup rattled in its saucer. *“What did you do to me?”* 

I pulled the cigarette butt from my lips and quashed it in her empty cup. “Make peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,” I answered flatly. Then I turned to look across the sun porch at the ghost only I could see.

Raymond was a disgusting mess. His shattered spine had no hope of holding his torso rigid, so every limp limb flopped at unholy angles. A fountain of black blood oozed from his white lips and nose. His intestines protruded from his stomach like ground beef squeezed between grimy fingers, and the coils hung to the ground like sausage links.

He stared at his young widow. 

Or, I should say, the one eye that hadn’t popped to jelly was staring.

I really think that Cindy would have been unnerved if she’d known he was there. 

Instead, she focused on me. “How long… when will it start?” She asked in utter petrification. 

“In just a second, Sweetie,” I quipped casually, lighting up another cigarette.

Raymond grunted. He wasn’t much for talking, what with the lolling tongue dangling impotently where his missing jaw should have been.

“Oh, and one last thing, Sugar.” I leaned forward and gently rested my palms on the tabletop. “Raymond wants to let you know that dying really, *really* fucking hurts.” 

She froze. Behind her, despite lacking a mouth, I could swear that Raymond was smiling.

The convulsing started then, but it didn’t stop for a long time. 

Do you have any idea how far mouth foam can spray when a dying woman just won’t stop thrashing?

I almost felt bad for her when I realized how hard she was trying to cry. 

That’s a really fucking difficult task, though, when your throat is closing up. 

That’s when Raymond sauntered over to her jittering body, knelt down, and gently grazed his dead fingertips across her cheek. He looked passionately into her eyes, and for just a moment, I think she looked back.

Then she was gone. 

The ghost-corpse took in the sight for a few moments before I interrupted him with a forced clearing of my throat.

“A-*hem.*” He glanced up at me with his lone functioning eye. It was damp. “I *do* appreciate your clear instructions on how to locate the briefcase. If everything is as promised, the bill will be settled.”

He grunted and waved his limp, floppy arm at the body of his dead wife. 

“Her? I’ll leave her in the backyard of your house. I snuck an oleander plant into the garden during one of my nightly visits. They’re not uncommon here in Alabama, and they will explain her ‘accidental’ death nicely.” I wrinkled my nose. “And I have to say, I’ll be grateful to stop sneaking into your house each night to spook this murderous little witch. Her masturbatory moans made me gag, and I hate crawling through windows. I’m not fifty anymore, you know.” I took in a deep breath of nicotine-laced air.

He grunted again, dangling his unresponsive arm above the dead woman once more. 

“Hmmm?” I asked in genuine curiosity as I approached the corpse. “There’s something more?”

He shook more eagerly, spraying a fine mist of ghost blood onto the woman’s purple face. 

“Oh, my,” I whispered.

I bent down and pried a ring from the woman’s rubbery hand. 

“There must be two dozen diamonds on this!” I sang. Then I slipped it onto my middle finger.

It fit perfectly. 

“Yes, thank you very much, I *do* accept tips for a job well done, you gentleman, you.”

This time I *know* Raymond was smiling.

And I was, too.

nosleep,"I volunteered to sit next to a dead man on a plane, and deeply regret it.","The man in seat 43-A died halfway across the Atlantic. I was sitting near the front of the plane, just behind first class, and couldn’t really see the commotion. But I could hear someone gasping and retching — loud at first, then quieter and quieter. A flight attendant got on the PA and asked for “any medical professionals among the passengers” to help. I guess there were none. 

After a few minutes, the man’s sounds deteriorated into a sort of gurgle, then silence, then it was over.

His name was Molyneaux, and he was old but not that old, and it was likely a heart attack, aneurism, drug reaction or God’s will, according to conflicting nth-hand reports that filtered down the plane from row 43, where a flight attendant simply buckled the newly deceased back into his window seat and covered his face with a complementary airline blanket.

The pilot got on the intercom and told us the plane would be turning back to New York “due to a tragic medical situation involving one of our passengers.”

“Folks, we’re looking for a volunteer willing to sit next to the deceased while we return to our originating airport,” the pilot continued. “This flight is entirely full, and the person sitting there now isn’t feeling comfortable. It’s an aisle seat, and it will only be a few hours before we’re back over land.”

I’m not sure why I volunteered — probably some combination of exhaustion, altruism and morbid curiosity. My vacation plans were shot anyway, I figured, so why not take the most interesting seat on the plane? The flight attendant thanked me profusely, as did a queasy looking teenager who took my original seat. I picked up my handbag and shuffled down the aisle to the very last row of the plane.

My only prior experience with corpses was an open casket funeral for my grandmother when I was a kid, but the idea of death had never particularly bothered me. It’s natural, after all. That said, I admit that I second-guessed my decision as soon as I saw my new seat mate.

Mr. Molyneaux, rest in peace, sat upright between the window and me, strapped around the waist, with a blue fleece blanket covering his torso and head. The blanket did not cover his hands, which were resting on his lap above his seatbelt — placed that way by a flight attendant as a sign of respect, I assumed. 

Molyneaux’s pale fingers were twisted into claws that betrayed the agony of his death. I couldn’t look at those hands without imagining what his face looked like under the blanket.

I thought of asking for a second blanket, but the flight crew was still busy calming down other passengers and preparing for our u-turn around the Atlantic Ocean. So I tried to forget my uneasiness and closed my eyes, and slept.

I woke — hours or minutes later, I don’t know — to the jostling of turbulence. The cabin lights were off and most of the passengers around me seemed to be sleeping. I looked out the window, trying not to look at Molyneaux as I did so, and saw only the uniform blackness of the night. I imagined the ocean miles below us, lightless and cold. The thought unsettled me and I reached across Molyneaux to close the window shade.

Then I stopped myself. *Hadn’t the shade been closed when I sat down?*

I realized there was something else off about the scene. Molyneaux’s posture had somehow changed while I slept. It took me a few seconds to pinpoint it. His gnarled hands remained on his lap, he was still belted at the waist, and the blanket still shrouded his upper body. But the fabric looked somehow twisted now, as if he had been fidgeting.

Very slowly — knowing it was insane even as I knew I couldn’t stop myself — I lifted a corner the blanket. 

I uncovered his shirt, which the flight crew had unbuttoned while trying to save him. A patch of blue-grey skin sprouting white chest hair peeked out from it.

I lifted the blanket higher. His collar was flecked with dried blood. I remembered his terrible gasping.

Finally, I pulled the blanket entirely off, and stifled a scream.

Molyneaux’s head was turned away from me, exactly as if he had turned to stare out the window. 

I could see his face reflected in the plexiglass. It was undoubtably a dead man’s face: pale, drawn, lips parted, jaw slack. There was no life in it.

Except his eyes. They were moving.

I stared at the reflection for half a minute and I’m sure of it. In the center of that death mask, two pupils flicked back and forth, as if tracking something out there in the sky.

“What are you doing?” a voice beside me interrupted. I whipped around and saw the woman seated across the aisle staring at me — not so much in fear as disgust. “Cover him back up! Give him his peace.”

“He’s … I think he’s been moving,” I stammered. “His eyes. I think he might not actually be ….” 

But I couldn’t finish the sentence; it was too crazy. Nor did I have to, because at that moment my stomach dropped ten feet along with everything else in the plane. 

Coffee cups and purses slammed against the ceiling. A man near the first class section nearly tumbled out of his seat. I heard call lights going off all over the plane as passengers were jolted awake in panic and confusion.

“Passengers, please take your seats, buckle in, and secure any loose items,” the pilot said over the PA, sounding shaken himself. “The weather along our flight path is clear and no planes in the area are reporting turbulence, so I’m not sure what this is. But we should be through it momentarily.”

Even as he spoke, the mild background shaking I’d felt since waking up became noticeably more violent. The woman across the aisle began fumbling for her seatbelt, no longer paying any attention to me or Molyneaux.

I forced myself to look at him again. The jolt must have caused him to pitch forward at the waist, his head colliding with the seat in front of him. 

But Molyneaux’s face was still turned toward the window — his neck twisted at such a sharp angle that I worried it had snapped.

I looked at his hands again, and the pallor of his skin. Three flight attendants and a dozen passengers had witnessed this man’s death, and I could not rationally imagine they were mistaken. 

And yet in the reflection of the window, his eyes left to right, left to right.

I had heard that strange reflexes sometimes kick in after death — limbs flailing, headless chickens running, nerves clearing out the last backlog of instructions from the brain. But the eyes? I had never heard of that.

I made myself look past that unsettling reflection, at the sky itself. It was still dark, moonless and cloudless, but the atmosphere seemed to have taken on a strange hue — a very dark green, like pea soup fog. I thought I could see vague shapes swirling around in the murk, though it might have been an optical illusion. I recoiled.

I desperately wanted to be anywhere else right then, but the rest of the cabin was approaching a state a pandemonium. Flight attendants were hurrying up and down the aisles, attending to spills and bruises, even as they tripped and staggered. The entire plane was shuddering like a barrel going down the rapids. 

A series of jolts sent Molyneaux’s upper body swinging back and forth like an upside down pendulum. He was thrown backward into his seat, then sideways into me (a horrible feeling I will never forget), and then the opposite way, his face slamming directly into the window, where it came to rest.

That was enough for me. I unbuckled, leapt out of my seat and locked myself in the bathroom directly behind me. I would cower on a toilet for the rest of this hellish flight rather than spend another minute sitting with Mr. Molyneaux.

This plan worked for a half hour or so. I braced both my arms against the bathroom’s walls and listened to the chimes of flight attendant call buttons, the whine of jet engines and the growling of the sky. I tried to calm myself by visualizing the skyline of New York, the JFK air strip, a calm descent.

But then I imagined Molyneaux’s window, his face mashed up against the glass like a little boy’s, his dead eyes searching the night.

The captain’s disembodied voice called me back to reality. He sounded outright scared now, and the PA kept cutting in and out.

“ … extremely anomalous weather … need everyone in their seats in the emergency position … immediately … if we depressurize … ”

The turbulence stopped for four or five seconds, and then suddenly it felt like I was inside a washing machine. I bounced against the walls of the bathroom, landed on the floor, and could barely manage to get the door open and crawl on all fours into the aisle.

All three flight attendants were down, sprawled on backs and bellies between the seats. Some of the overhead luggage bins had burst open and spewed baggage out. Many of the passengers were weeping. A few prayed. And through it all, the plane would not stop shaking.

I heard a series of small bangs above my head and felt something wet on my cheek. Every single soda can in the galley had exploded. I climbed into my seat and belted myself in, having briefly forgotten about Molyneaux in my terror.

THWACK THWACK

But he was still in his seat of course, whipping back and forth like a flagpole in a hurricane, head-butting the window so hard that I could see the plexiglass balloon outwards and rebound each time. 

THWACK

I became worried he’d crack the window, though that’s supposed to be impossible, so I overcame my revulsion and grabbed his shoulders. But I couldn’t restrain him. 

Again and again, his head hit the window. I began to fear that it was not simply the motion of the plane that compelled him. 

THWACK THWACK THWACK

No one else on the plane was watching this. Some of the passengers had rallied and were trying to pull the injured flight attendants out of the aisle. Others were whispering goodbye messages into their phones.

THWACK THWACK KRKRRRRR

I heard something crack beside me, and hoped desperately that it was Molyneaux’s skull, and not the window. Outside I could see that the green fog was alive with swirling, amorphous shapes.

THWACK KRKRRRR KRKOOM KRKOOM

Another explosion. Not pop cans this time, but pressurized oxygen escaping into sky. Molyneaux had managed to smash out both window panes in one, final blow. Now his mangled head was hanging outside the plane, and the rest of his body was straining to follow it, restrained only by his seatbelt and the width of his shoulders.

An alarm went off in the cabin, and a jungle of oxygen masks fell from the ceilings. I put mine on at once, but heard other people screaming. Some passengers were trying desperately to get masks on the unconscious air crew, but the plane was shaking more violently than ever, and loose debris was flying up the aisles toward my row — toward the hole a dead man had made in the airplane.

“… cabin breach…” said the pilot. “… limited backup oxygen, so I’m trying to descend to a safe altitude … but hard to do that in this storm, or whatever it is … God be with us.”

Once I was sure that I could breath and was no in danger of being sucked out myself, I took one last look at Molyneaux. His head might have torn clean off outside the window, for all I could see of it past the rest of his body. 

I pictured those eyes again, which had seen something in the sky that we had not seen — could not see, even as it now threatened to shake the plane apart. There was some connection between these events that I might never understand. But even without understanding, I could make the last move available to me.

I reached over Molyneaux’s lap, lifted one of those cold, clawed hands, and unclasped his seatbelt.

There was an intolerable crunching noise as, I presume, his shoulders were squeezed and crushed to fit the window frame. And then in a split second he was gone — out the window, into the night, a pale old man falling end over end toward the black ocean.

“Whatever you saw out there,” I whispered. “Whatever you were looking for, go to it and leave us be.”

The green fog lifted a few minutes later, and the plane descended until it was safe to breath without the masks. Less than an hour later, I really did see the JFK airstrip. A whole squadron of police and ambulances met us on the way down. The flight attendants and several passengers had to be hospitalized, but as far as I know no one suffered serious injuries. 

Federal investigators eventually concluded that we had flown through a localized weather anomaly — witnessed by no other plane in the sky that night. Some sort of debris must have been flying around up there with us and taken out the window at 43-A, they wrote in their report: “This event led to a sudden loss of cabin pressure, in which the body of a passenger who had died earlier in an unrelated medical emergency was ejected from the plane.”  

I expected to hear a lot more about it on the news, but I suppose in the end it was just one of those things. The airline had no interest in publicizing the incident, of course, and the passengers had no desire to relive it. 

For most people on the flight, it was simply a freak tragedy followed by a close call, and all’s well that ends well. I’m the only one that will dream for the rest of my life about Molyneaux’s eyes, and what they saw on the way to the ocean.",Entertainment
nosleep,Has anyone heard of the Left/Right Game? (Part 1),"A few points before we start. 

Firstly, I am not the protagonist of this story. I just went to university with her, and though she went on to become a professional writer, I most certainly did not. She'll be taking over from me further down but, until then, please forgive my slightly awkward delivery while I give you guys the necessary context. 

Secondly, I don't know what you will make of the following events, and I'm sure many of you might consider it all some sort of hoax. I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, and has never been, a fantasist.

Ok so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman. Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps ""studied"" isn't the word. It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject. Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot. 

We met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it. She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I’m not too sure what she saw in me.

We were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio. The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand. We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.

That party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst… something like that.

The radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you’ll glean further down, I’m less happy about it than I would’ve thought.

Arriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox. An email that would later be described as ""suspicious"" by my tech literate friends. Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni, and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. Lessons like ""Don't call it Cyberspace"" of course and more importantly, ""Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address.""

I realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:

Left.Right.AS

I don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.

Opening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file ""07-02-2017"". (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).

I’ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me. They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I’d have to agree. But the thing is, I do know her. Alice Sharma only cares about the truth and if that's the case with these files, insane as it may sound, then it’s very possible my friend has documented her own disappearance.

The people who suggested this forum said you discuss strange occurrences etc. If you guys have come across anything to do with the below, or know any of the people involved, then please send any information my way.

The Left/Right Game
[DRAFT 1]
07/02/2017

They say great stories happen to those who can tell them. Robert J. Guthard is an exception to that rule. As I sit at his table, sip his coffee and listen to him recount the past 65 years it sounds like he's reading off a shopping list. Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences. Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits. 

It's a great story, no matter how you tell it.

By the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer, and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.

**ROB:** Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.

**AS:** For work?

**ROB:**Vietnam.

**AS:** You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?

**ROB:** I ain't never been back since.

That was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.

Rob had four marriages after that, and even more professions. After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.

**ROB:** I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?

**AS:** My mum and dad are from India yeah.

**ROB:** See I could tell.

He'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk. 

A friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.

**ROB:** The Japanese are good people. Good manners. But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for, spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?

**AS:** I don't think so""

**ROB:** Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu. Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.

**AS:** Did you ever meet Jorogumo?

**ROB** Nah she didn't show. None of them did. I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara

Aokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji, a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, took him to Aokigahara to chase ""yurei"" the ghosts of the forest.

**AS:** Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?

**ROB:** Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.

From that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.

**ROB:** It walked up to me through the trees. Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.

**AS:** Almost?

**ROB:** It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.

Hiroji had good reason to be annoyed. Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? I'd be more than a little cranky.

But Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends. Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.

**ROB:** I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.

**AS:** How many have you proven so far?

**ROB:** Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. That's why I called you guys up.

At this point, Rob can’t hope to repress his smile.

The Left/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, only Rob took an interest in the post.

**ROB:** The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.

**AS:** What details grabbed your interest?

**ROB:** Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.

**AS:** And you were that somebody.

**ROB:** That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.

**AS:** And how did it go?

**ROB:** Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left/Right Game is the real thing.

The rules of the Left/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, but Rob says their not so easy to follow.

**ROB:** There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.

**AS:** Did you move to Phoenix for the Left/Right game?

**ROB:** That's right.

I try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. I can clearly read his expression too. ""You'll see."" It says. ""Just wait.""

I wouldn't have to wait long. Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. He didn't just want to talk about the Left/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.

Rob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, ""Prepping the Run"", as he calls it. He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.

More after this.

When I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.

**ROB:** - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road.""

Rob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he’s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.

**ROB:** We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.

**AS:** There are other people coming?

**ROB:** We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.

This is the first I’ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I’m surprised. The game is Rob's obsession, and I’m here at his request. The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.

Half an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the ""functional clothing"" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I take my pack out to the porch. Rob’s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.

**AS:** I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.

**ROB:** If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.

**AS:** Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.

**ROB:** Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.

**AS:** Thank you.

**ROB:** In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, she's a thing of beauty.

To Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. It’s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.

**ROB:** What're you thinking?

**AS:** I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.

**ROB:** Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.

**AS:** Aren't Jeeps open top usually?

**ROB:** Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.

I climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.

I wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.

**ROB:** We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.

**AS:** His name's Apollo?

**ROB:** That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.

**AS:** Why are you using call signs?

**ROB:** Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, keep communication clear.

**AS:** What's your callsign?

**ROB:** Ferryman.

**AS:** ... What's my call sign?

**ROB:** I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?

**AS:** I'm from Bristol.

**ROB:** Bristol? That’s fine I guess.

It’s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner. Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.

Apollo vaguely resembles his namesake, dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it’s clear he couldn’t be less of a fighter. This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.

**AS:** How far have you come?

**APOLLO:** I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.

**AS:** And you know Rob from the forums?

**APOLLO:** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha

Rob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. Rob’s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. I was more impressed with Rob himself. Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. My dad is Rob’s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.

The rest don't take long to arrive. Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. They’re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.

**CLYDE:** We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. Pleasure to meet you ma'am.

**AS:** Pleasure to meet you too.

**CLYDE:** Would you be the journalist?

**AS:** That's right.

**CLYDE:** You used to write for the town paper didn't you?

He's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.

Next to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.

**LILITH:** We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-

**EVE:** -He's a seismologist

**LILITH:** Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. Predictable movement.

**EVE:** We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.

**AS:** I'll have to check my schedule

**EVE:** OK cool let me give you my email...

They quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.

The last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign “Ace”. Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.

**ROB:** Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-

**ACE:** It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.

**ROB:** You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.

**ACE:** I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.

**ROB:** Well I know that's true.

Ace and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.

With five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. Communicate clearly and often. It’s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn’t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers? Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he’s put into these runs, the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.

With a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.

**ROB:** You ready for this Bristol?

**AS:** I'm ready.

**ROB:** Ok then let's hit the road.

The Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.

Rob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. He looks back to the road as Ace’s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.

**APOLLO:** This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha

**ROB:** Hah as many as it takes.

I can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.

**ROB:** You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.

**AS:** What do you mean?

**ROB:** You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. Before you find out this is all just a story.

**AS:** Does that disappoint you?

**ROB:** I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.

**AS:** OK...

**ROB:** We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, walk in any direction you like, and you won’t be in the game no more. Once we go through, you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you’re home. And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?

**AS:** I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.

**ROB:** Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.

We've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. I even start to worry if there’ll be anything at all for this story. “Reporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man” isn’t exactly Pulitzer worthy.

Turn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..

I briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. Even from a distance I can see that she’s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.

I look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. She’s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.

**GREYWOMAN:** Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.

**AS:** Rob what's happening?

**ROB:** Ignore her.

**GREYWOMAN:** He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.

**AS:** Miss, are you alright?

The smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.

**GREYWOMAN:** What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!

I reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, with every intent of breaking through.

**GREYWOMAN:** Would you dance down the lion’s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!

Rob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. She yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by. 

As she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.

The mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, the fractured spider’s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.

**AS:** Rob, what was that?

**ROB:** She's there sometimes.

**AS:** On that street?

**ROB:** On the 34th turn.

**AS:** Who is she?

**ROB:** I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.

I find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.

If we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. Maybe he'd bought into the game’s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.

Alternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.

There is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.

The radio crackles.

**LILITH:** Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?

**AS:** I think it picked her up.

**LILITH:** My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?

**AS:** When's our stopping point?

**ROB:** For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.

Rob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.

We'd arrived at the tunnel.

**AS:** What is this supposed to pass under?

**ROB:** Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.

**AS:** And if we weren't playing the game?

**ROB:** Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?

Rob turns to me. It’s the first time he’s taken his eyes off the road since we started. He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.

**ROB:** You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?

It’s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn’t feel like he’s attempting to dramatise. It feels like I’m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what’s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?

**AS:** What are you waiting for?

Rob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.

**ROB:** This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. We got a long ways to go.

Much like the game I’m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. I’d heard all about his life, but I’m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I’m not certain that I trust him. And though I admire his dedication to the Left/Right Game, I’m not sure I’ll like where it might lead us. Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, I’m along for the ride.",Entertainment
nosleep,My sugar daddy asks me for weird favors (Part 2),"[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/diuucz/my_sugar_daddy_asks_me_for_weird_favors/)

I didn’t leave my house for almost an entire week. 

The only reason I didn’t stay indoors for longer is that I had an important exam in one of my classes that I absolutely had to be present for. 

That also didn’t help with the anxiety I was feeling. As I drove to campus I kept my eyes glued to my surroundings, almost running two stop signs and a red light. I kept expecting Jack--- or fake Jack I suppose---to pop out randomly on the side of the road, or in the car next to me, or the car behind me. I constantly glanced at my rearview mirror trying to figure out if the black truck behind me had been there this whole time or if it was different than the one I had seen ten minutes ago. 

I hadn’t told him where I went to school so maybe he wouldn’t know. Then again, I hadn’t told him where I lived either, and he seemed to figure that one out rather quickly. 

I hadn’t texted the real Jack since the incident had happened. I mean, I didn’t even know what I was supposed to say. 

“*Oops I didn’t follow all your rules and now there’s a weird look-alike of yours running around the city*”?

My plan, as foolish as it was, was to act as if all was well. I wasn’t going to stir the pot by telling him I had already fucked up, so instead, I was going to wait until he realized that something was wrong. Hopefully, he wouldn’t. 

I will admit that not telling him was more difficult than I had thought, and I found myself constantly checking my phone for texts from Jack, but none appeared. 

I finished my exam that day, sure that I had failed due to my lack of focus, and drove back home where I found Julio standing in my driveway. He was looking down at his phone, and I attempted to keep driving down the street before he saw me, but I wasn’t fast enough. 

He glanced and began walking towards my car as I slowly pulled into the driveway, locking my doors and trying to remain calm. Instead of shifting into park, I kept my foot on the brake and shifted into reverse, fully ready in case I needed to make a quick getaway. 

I sat in the driver's seat, looking forward, at my front door. I wondered for a second if I would be able to get inside and lock the door before Julio got to me. Suddenly, he leaned down and knocked on the window, making me jump. 

I turned to look at him and said nothing. 

“Roll your window down.” He said, motioning for me to lower the window. 

I pressed the button for a split second, making only a tiny crack of open space. 

“You know, it’s not me you should be afraid of.”

I looked at him, and glanced at my rearview mirrors, trying to see if any of my neighbors were outside. But they weren’t and I was alone with no witnesses. 

“You fucked it up,” he said, leaning against my car. “I told you to watch out, and you didn’t. You managed to fuck up the rules in one night. They always miss at least one.”

*They*?

I looked up at him but said nothing because I honestly had no clue what to say. 

“Get out of the car, we’re going inside.” He tapped his hand on the roof of my car and walked towards my front door. 

I thought about driving away, but I wasn’t sure where I would go, and a part of me wanted to hear him out. So, I found myself parking the car, turning off the engine, and letting Julio into my house. 

He took a seat on my couch and glanced around my living room. “This is fancy for a college student. You buy this with Jack’s money?” He asked. 

I rolled my eyes as I stood in front of him. “Why did you want to come in?” 

“Alright, touchy subject,” he said, shrugging. “I need to talk to you about Jack.”

“Which Jack? The one I’ve been talking to or the one who appeared in the house?”

“What?” He snapped, leaning over and resting his elbows on his knees. 

“What?”

“What do you mean, the one who appeared in the house? Jack isn’t back yet. I came here to tell you that you forgot to lock the door after your little house-sitting gig, which Jack won’t be pleased about. He’s very particular about his stuff. He’s gotten rid of girls for much pettier shit than this.”

I said nothing and stared at Julio while he stared back, waiting for me to explain myself. His use of the words ‘gotten rid of’ made me nervous and I wondered what he meant by that. Surely he wouldn’t kill me over a mistake, right?

“Was there someone else in the house?” He asked after a few seconds of silence. 

“J-Jack. Jack was in the house that morning before I left.”

“How do you suppose that happened? Because Jack hasn’t come back from his trip yet.”

I shrugged, not really knowing what to say. 

Julio stood up, sighing in annoyance. “Fine. You know what? I originally came over here to ask you for a share of the cash you got for your poor house-sitting job, but it seems to me that you probably fucked up more than I originally thought, so I’m just going to stay out of whatever this is. Good luck.”

He walked over and opened my front door, waving to me as he left, leaving me standing in my empty house. 

I ran to the door and locked it as soon as he was gone, and started to freak out once again. I thought about what I was going to do if Jack came back from his trip and found out that I had messed up. What if Julio was right and someone had broken into the house and robbed him? Maybe I just *thought* I saw Jack, but maybe it was just some other stranger who looked like him. My mind was going a mile a minute as I tried to figure out what to do. 

I paced around my house for a few hours before I finally decided that I was going to drive back to Jack’s house and make sure that no one had broken in. If they had, I would simply make an anonymous police report or something. Besides, the only way he would ever know that it was my fault would be if Julio snitched on me, which it didn’t seem like he was planning on doing anymore. 

I made the drive over in silence, trying to control my breathing so that I didn’t have a meltdown on the highway. I finally pulled into the driveway and turned the engine off, but I couldn’t work up the courage to get out of the car. I sat there for a few minutes, staring at the giant house, trying to force myself to unbuckle my seatbelt, open the door, and get out of the car. 

The house, which once looked impressive, now made me feel anxious and out of place. I couldn’t stop myself from imagining all sorts of horrible scenarios that I could stumble upon once I opened the door. I thought about how many possible hiding places there were in a house that large. 

I don’t know how long I sat there before I finally decided to get out of the car and walk towards the front door. I hesitated for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and pushing the door open. Only it didn’t open, because it was locked. 

I assumed that Julio had probably locked it and looked for the key on my keychain. I unlocked the door and stepped into the living room, taking a look around. 

Everything looked normal enough. There were no signs of breaking and entering or anything like that, and I was glad that Julio had come over and realized my mistake before someone else had. I closed the door behind me, this time double-checking that I locked it, and began to make my way further into the house. 

I went into the library first, which looked the same as it had when I left it. Next, I made my way through the living room, glancing around to see if anything was out of place, but nothing was. 

I was starting to feel better now that I had confirmed that no one had broken in and ruined the place. 

That feeling was short-lived however when I walked into the kitchen. 

It was a complete mess. Both the fridge and the freezer were wide open, all the containers of food emptied out. There were empty boxes of frozen foods tossed inside the freezer and on the kitchen floor. There were a few trays of meat that were laying out on the table and the counters, and some of the red juice from the meats had been spilled inside the fridge and now dripped down onto the floor. 

I noticed that while there hadn’t been much food in there in the first place, it was all gone. As I got closer to the fridge, I realized that it wasn’t cool, and the light inside the fridge wasn’t working either. I assumed that whoever ate all the food also unplugged it for some odd reason. 

I stepped over an empty carton of orange juice and an empty crate of eggs as I made my way towards the stove where I found stacks of unwashed pans. One of them was still hot, meaning that it was only recently taken off the burner. There were eggshells all over the counter and I thought back to that morning when Jack, or whoever that was, had made me eggs for breakfast. 

I walked back out of the kitchen, careful not to step on the mess that littered the floor, and made my way down the hallway. 

I spotted the door at the end of the hall, and this time it was closed. As I continued to walk down the hall, I couldn’t help but notice how eerily quiet it was in the house. I couldn’t even hear the sound of the heater running. As I passed the thermostat in the hallway, I saw that it wasn’t working. The screen was off and there was nothing on it like it had been turned off or something. I leaned forward and pressed a few of the buttons but none of them worked. 

I poked my head into the study, but that was also empty, although I did see that the landline had been used recently, and whoever used it didn’t put it back. The handheld part was hanging off the side of the desk, and I stepped in, grabbing the phone and holding it up to my ear, but there was only silence. 

I put it back and followed the cord with my eyes. It was connected to the wall, but it seemed like there was no power in the house, which explained the refrigerator and the thermostat. I walked out of the study and headed down the hall again, but I froze in my tracks when I noticed that the door at the end of the hall was open now. 

Someone was in the house. 

I reached into my back pocket and grabbed my phone, checking to see if maybe I had missed a text from Jack, but I had no signal inside the house. I held my phone in my hand anyway, hoping I’d pick up enough signal to call for help, and began to back away from the door, listening carefully for any footsteps or noises that would let me know where the intruder was.

As I spun around, I found myself face-to-face with Jack. Or whoever it was that I was looking at. 

I knew he was the same man I had seen that morning, but no I had no idea who he really was. 

“Sorry!” I said, startled. 

“Which one are you?” He asked, squinting at me. 

He was dressed in a stained gray t-shirt and old pajama bottoms that looked like they had been purchased thirty years ago. 

“What?” I asked. 

“You’re the new one, right? The one from the other day? You’re the one who forgot to turn the television on.” 

“Yeah, I’m so sorry. I thought I was being careful I didn’t mean to-”

I stopped talking as he started laughing. 

“Sorry?” He asked, grinning. “I should be thanking you!”

“Who are you?” I asked him. 

I stared at his face, and he looked exactly like Jack, but I couldn’t figure out why he was here when he said he was still on his trip. 

“I’m Jack.” He replied as if he were stating the obvious.

“But Jack said he wouldn’t be back for a few days.”

His expression changed and he narrowed his eyes at me. “Did he tell you when he would be back? The exact date?”

I shook my head, confused, and thinking about how I was going to get past this man and get out of this damn house. 

“But you can ask him, right?” 

“I-I don’t know, he hasn’t contacted me in a few days.”

“Damnit, I was hoping it wouldn’t be that bad.”

“Can you explain to me what the hell is going on?” I asked him. 

“You shouldn’t have come back here.” 

Something felt off to me, and chills shook my entire body. Part of me regretted not going with my original plan of acting like everything was okay. I didn’t want to stay in the house any longer, and there was really nothing that I could do anyway. Besides, I was getting a bad feeling from this guy claiming to be Jack. I slowly stepped past him, glancing back behind me as I continued to walk into the living room and towards the front door. 

I found myself walking faster and faster until I was basically running and throwing myself at the front door. I couldn’t help but shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen if I stayed in this house any longer. 

I unlocked the door, but just as I was about to open it, I heard the lock slide back into place; only it sounded a lot louder than usual. I jiggled the doorknob and realized that while the doorknob wasn’t locked, something else was, and it was keeping me from opening the door. 

I began to freak out as I pulled on the door urgently, trying to get it to open but something was keeping it shut. 

“What the fuck?” I said out loud. 

I glanced towards the hall as I heard another noise, but I quickly realized that it was the sound of air flowing through the vents. It seemed like the power was back, and somehow, some sort of security system had activated at the same time. 

I looked down at my phone and not only did I have a signal now, but I also had three messages from Jack. 

**I’m back.** 

**What happened?**

**I know you’re in the house.** 

I looked around the room, trying to find him or any security cameras in the room that would be alerting him of my presence in the house. I didn’t see any and grabbed my phone to text him back. 

**Are you here?**

I held my phone in my hands as I made my way back towards the hallway to find the other Jack that I had seen earlier. If he even was another Jack. Maybe this was all the same person and he was just messing with me for some reason. 

A part of me thought that perhaps I deserved all of this for doing all of this in the first place. I mean, why was I so quick to agree to run random errands for a random man that I had never met? Sure, I needed the money, but going into a stranger's house has got to be on the list of the top ten dumbest things you could ever do. Especially considering the fact that no one knew where I was, and I didn’t have a weapon to defend myself if I needed to. 

I stood in front of the closed door for a second, before making my way over to a window. I tried to open it, but the security system had locked the windows shut as well. I thought about breaking the window open, and I grabbed a sturdy-looking vase. I took a few steps back and then threw it at the window as hard as I could. 

The vase shattered as it made contact with the window glass, but the window was fine, unscratched. 

The only way I was getting out of here was through the door, but first, I had to disarm the security system somehow. 

I walked back to where I had left Jack, but he was gone and nowhere to be found. 

“Jack?” I called, my voice echoing throughout the house. 

The door at the end of the hall was closed once again, and I began to walk towards it, peeking into each room as I passed it, but there was no one else in the house. 

As I reached the door, my phone buzzed in my hand. 

**You were supposed to follow the rules.** 

I stood in front of the door, trying to work up the courage to open it and see what was in the room. 

**I know, I’m sorry. I came back to make sure everything was okay.** 

I reached out and grabbed the doorknob, taking deep breaths. The buzzing in my hand startled me and I ignored it as I turned the doorknob and pulled the door open. 

I stood in the threshold, at the top of a wooden staircase. Below it was a badly lit basement. I slowly walked down the stairs, glancing at my phone. 

**You should’ve stayed away. You’re really going to regret this.**

I didn’t reply and kept walking until I was at the bottom of the stairs. While I wasn’t sure what I was expecting, it wasn’t the normal-looking basement apartment that I had stumbled into. I found Jack sitting on the couch against one of the walls. He was reading a magazine and glanced up when he heard me step off the stairs. 

“What are you doing!?” He shot to his feet, as he shouted at me. 

“The door locked, I can’t get out!” I replied. 

“You’re so fucking *stupid*!” He exclaimed, walking over to me.

“That’s rude, how was I supposed to know the doors would lock when the power came back on?”

“You weren’t supposed to come back!” He shouted, his face turning an angry shade of red as he yelled. 

“I wanted to make sure everything was fine,” I replied. 

“Who cares?! You got a thousand dollars for house sitting! Why didn’t you take it and leave?” 

“Why are you so angry? Why are you even here? You’re clearly not Jack.” I snapped, annoyed. 

“How do you know?” He asked, in a calmer tone. 

“What?”

“How do you know I’m not Jack? I look like the pictures you’ve seen, don’t I?”

“Yeah, but Jack is on vacation,” I replied. 

“How do you know?” He repeated. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“Have you ever met Jack in person? Have you ever talked to him on the phone? Video call? Anything other than a text message every few days?” 

I didn’t reply, staring at him. He was right, he did look exactly like the photos I had seen on the Tinder profile. 

“That’s what I thought.” He replied to my silence. 

“What are you saying exactly?” I asked as I heard my phone buzz once again. 

“How do you know that the person you’ve been talking to is a real person? As a matter of fact, how do you know that it’s not me? Maybe this was my plan all along, to lure you here.” 

At that point, it finally hit me. He was right; I didn’t know if I was talking to a real person. All that I was doing random favors for someone with an internet profile who wanted to pay me money to do these things for some reason. I guess I had always felt that there was something off about a sugar daddy who was willing to pay someone to do things other than having sex with them, but I needed to money too badly to spend too much time questioning it. 

I was feeling even more scared now, and my palms were cold and sweaty as I stood there, waiting for him to do something. I could run back upstairs, but I didn’t think I was fast enough to get out of there and find something to jam the door and keep him downstairs. 

I took a shaky deep breath as I tried my hardest not to make it seem like I was scared. If Jack was dangerous, I didn’t want to alert him of my plans to try and run.

After a few seconds of silence, I glanced down at my phone to read the most recent text, but there were no new notifications. 

“That wasn’t your phone,” Jack said, breaking the silence. 

I looked up at him and glanced at the phone sitting on a nearby table. 

Suddenly, he jumped towards me and I attempted to jump out of the way but I was too slow. I saw Jack grab my arms and my phone fell out of my hands, and then everything went black. 

When I came to, I was on the living room couch and Jack was standing above me, looking down. 

“What happened?” I asked. 

I attempted to sit up but I noticed that I was incredibly dizzy, and my left arm felt sore when I tried to prop myself up. I remembered Jack grabbing me earlier, and I figured he had gripped my arm too tight and must have bruised it in the process. 

“You’re finally up, good.” He said. 

I slowly managed to sit up, wincing as I put weight on my left arm. I looked up at Jack, who was now standing a few feet away, with a bandage wrapped around his right bicep. 

“What happened?” I asked, looking at the bandage, noticing that there was blood seeping through. 

“You really shouldn’t have come back.” 

I tried to shift my position on the couch and winced in pain as I put weight on my left arm again. I turned to look at it, trying to see if I had injured it somehow, and noticed that it was also wrapped in a bandage similar to Jack’s. 

“What happened?” I repeated, looked down at my arm. 

I slowly reached over and started to unwrap the bandage until It came off and I was left staring at crudely done stitches on the inside of my bicep. 

“What the fuck is this?!” I snapped, looking at Jack. 

“Sorry Ivy, but you really shouldn’t have come back. Although, I’m kind of glad you did. I didn’t really want to do this, but I need to get out of here.”

He began to back away from me, heading towards the front door. I watched as he easily opened it, and wondered how he disabled the lock and if he had been the one to activate it in the first place. 

He stepped out of the door and turned back to look at me. “Good luck, I helped you out a bit while you were out,” he said, motioning towards my phone which he had set down on the couch next to me. 

I stood up and went after him. Surprisingly, he didn’t try to run or back up and simply stood about a foot away from the front door, watching me. 

As I attempted to step outside, a stabbing pain erupted in my left arm, traveling throughout the rest of my body until I felt like I was being stabbed everywhere at once. I fell to the floor crying out in pain. Once I was back in the house, the pain went away and I laid on the floor shaking in the aftermath as I stared up at Jack. 

“What did you do to me?” I asked. 

“I had to get out. It’s been eight months. I’m sorry, you were just the first one to come back this time. I’m sure you’re a good person but I’m sorry, I can’t be here.”

“You’re just going to leave me here?!” I shouted. 

“Julio will come by to give you food. And by the way, don’t try to cut that thing out of your arm, this place is covered in cameras. If you do anything suspicious Julio will see you, and he won’t hesitate to stop you. I learned that the hard way.”

I didn’t know what to say, and I stood there in shock as I watched Jack walk over to my car and get in it, starting the engine and disappearing down the street. 

I finally shut the front door and locked it, turning back to face the empty house. I glanced at my phone, which was still on the couch, and remembered what Jack said before he left. 

I walked over, trying not to move my arm too much as I picked it up and turned it on. My Tinder profile was open, only it had been changed and now my profile bio read: *Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.*

On the table next to it, there was a list of house-sitting rules, similar to the ones that I had found on the day that I had been here. At the bottom of the page there was a lime green sticky note that read: *Sorry, I hope you’re able to get out soon. Don’t worry, maybe you won’t be here for long. They almost always forget one of the rules. Good luck---Jack.*

nosleep,"I found a disturbing yoga stream. If I stop watching, I can't save her.","She called it *Yoga for One*.

I found her stream a month ago, during a rare confluence of self-disdain and spare time that collided into something resembling motivation. Tucked between the kickboxing classes and the home-gym meatheads was her thumbnail.

It caught my eye. It was a simple shot of her face, so near to the camera that I could count the freckles. Her teeth a little too large for her mouth and her nose ever so slightly crooked.

I’ve never been the type of guy to consider yoga, but I tuned in, and in a matter of seconds, I was entranced.

The girl was in her living room, a haphazard mise-en-scene – the floor speckled with sad little plants and stacks of magazines. She posed with her hands on the floor and her hips thrust in the air. Her butt perched in the center of the screen.

I decided to stay a while.

I had no yoga mat, so I laid out a towel. It was difficult to follow along – she talked, a *lot*, and only a fraction of it was about the routine. “Press your heels together and bend your head to your feet, breathing deeply. My feet smell like peaches and cream today. Makes me want to gobble them up. I love summer peaches, I love biting into them and feeling the juice erupt in my mouth, it reminds me of the time when – ”

And I fell into the meditative quagmire woven by her words, inhaling the scent of my own socks, failing to notice she’d moved into a different pose.

After a while, my muscles trembled with the effort of supporting my soft body in these unfamiliar positions, so I called it a day. It was then that I noticed it.

*Subscribers: 1*

That was me. I was the only one watching. I felt an inexplicable flood of guilt when I closed the browser, like I was abandoning her.

I checked back into her channel the next few afternoons. It was the strangest thing. She was *always* streaming. She was either unaware of my presence, or apathetic to it. Her ramblings, so freewheeling that they approached random word association, didn’t seem to change whether I was there or not – she was often mid-sentence when I logged in. She was flirty in a way that made it clear she wasn’t trying to be, charmingly raw in her tendency to fumble instructions.

Curiosity overwhelmed me. I yearned to discover more about this fascinating creature. Her movements drew me in, like she was grasping at me through the screen. I marveled at the feeling of being her silent voyeur.

I developed more comfort with the basic poses, though I still couldn’t get my hands anywhere near my toes. Too soon, she notched up the level of difficulty. She eased herself into the splits. Each leg outstretched, her toes pointed at perfect right angles. I tried my best to replicate the pose, my groin protesting the pressure. Each day, she pushed a little farther. She curved her spine sharply behind her, a graceful arc. She lifted her back leg high into the air at an angle that seemed to wrench her hip out of place.

I forced my body into the closest approximations of her geometry that my tendons would allow, my teeth gritted against the sharp warnings issued by my nerves. At night I dreamed that she was breaking my joints, cracking my limbs into the clean shapes that she maintained so effortlessly.

One day she twisted her arms so far behind her that I felt sympathetic pain, and folded herself up so that her bent legs swooped around her shoulders, touching her toes behind her neck. She smiled at the camera, demurely, politely. “You want to see me bend into a pretzel, don’t you?” she asked.

That was the first time she addressed me.

I would forget to eat. I’d wake up on the couch, having dozed off, and she would be murmuring about pomegranates while her forehead brushed her knees. Did she sleep? Did she eat? I saw no evidence of it.

Every time I moved, my body ached with the memory of being stretched to its limit. I was spending ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day on her stream. She spoke to me frequently. “I know you’ve been watching me. I think you like watching me. How far do you want me to twist for you?”

The fluid shifting of her body into vertices and curves and delicate polygons was hypnotizing. I was getting lost in the light of a flickering flame as it swirled into different patterns. I was working myself into something more pliable, molding myself into something like her image.

It's difficult to pinpoint the moment she went too far. It was more like the creep of quicksand than any one single point.

She would lie on her back and lift herself on the palms and soles of her feet, her torso thrusting at the ceiling like she was something from the Exorcist. She would inch her hands and feet closer together, folding her body backwards on itself until she was nearly split in half. And then she would skitter forward until the whites of her eyes flooded the screen, scaring me so much that I jumped. And she would laugh, as if she had made a joke.

She would twist her head around like an owl, and thrust it between her thighs. Always blinking at the screen. Always smiling like we were sharing some inside secret, like I was in on the sly conspiracy.

She said, “You like this, don’t you, Mr. Smith? Am I your foldable pocket toy?”

Smith is a very common last name. There was a nonzero chance she’d just guessed correctly. But this freaked me out enough to slam the laptop shut, shattering the image of her toothy smile.

I tried to resume normal life. But I had almost nothing to fill my time except television and social media and filling out applications for jobs I’d never want to work. A strange sensation tickled at me, like something was wrong, like I was forgetting something. And powerful waves of guilt, the same guilt I’d felt when I closed her stream the first day I’d found her.

I tried not to. I really, really tried to stay away. But the urge overwhelmed me, so I returned.

For the first time, she wasn’t onscreen when I logged in. I peered closer at the scene, seeing the familiar yoga mat on the ground, the coffee table, the magazines. There was a soft noise coming from just off-screen, a muffled noise, irregular and halting. A human voice. I turned the volume all the way up, and I couldn’t tell if it was laughter or crying.

Feeling sick, I closed the stream.

This brings us to yesterday.

I had spent countless hours thinking about her, wondering what she was doing, whether she was still telling stories to her invisible visitor. I logged in.

Her eyes filled the webcam’s field of vision, so suddenly that I scrambled backwards. And that sound – echoing around the walls of her apartment and mine, and it was now clear that it was a sound of misery.

Her moan was wordless, and as her face backed away, I saw why. Her bare foot was stuffed halfway in her mouth, her jaw nearly unhinged to accommodate it, the ball wedged between her teeth. Tears were streaming down her face, pooling around the corners of her stretched lips.

Her arms were folded behind her head and her other leg was tucked under the first. She was struggling, and I realized that she was stuck.

She was trapped in that position, a twisted ball of limbs and strained joints, unable to speak.

I stared slackjawed at the screen, and her eyes met mine, seeming to blink in recognition. The force of her sobs crescendoed. In relief? I wasn’t sure.

I had no idea what to do. I didn’t know her name or where she lived – I didn’t even know for sure that she was in the same country. I sat, frozen, for long moments, watching the twitching of her limbs as she tried to wrench herself out of the cage her body made. Then it struck me: I could type.

*Can you type your address?*

The messaged pinged its arrival at her computer. Our first real communication.

She shook her head almost imperceptibly, with the slight range of motion her position allowed.

I tried again: *Can you type with your nose?*

Her eyes flickered across the page as she read my words. With great effort she rocked herself over, landing face-first on the keyboard. *sivioshgeusoh*, she typed.

My heart pounding, I said, *try again*.

I watched as she managed to prop herself precariously on one shoulder. Her body was convulsing with the force of her sobs. Eventually, she leaned forward, carefully, delicately, and pressed the tip of her nose to the keys. *3*.

Yes! That was it! *That’s great. Give me another number.*

We traded for long, suspenseful minutes, her giving me one number or letter at a time, me writing them down and encouraging her as best I could. *You’re doing great. I’m here with you. Help is on the way.*

She had cobbled together a number and a street. It had taken us nearly an hour to get to this point. She had just finished typing *apt12* when she stopped, trembling with the effort of keeping herself upright, and we met eyes again through the camera, hers shining with pain and fear. And then she collapsed.

She rolled out of sight. Panicking, I sent her dozens of frantic messages: *What city? What state? Stay with me. I’m here. Where are you? I need more.*

It became clear that no more was coming. Her sobs stilled, her breath quieted.

I searched the address and found every city in the country where the address she’d given me existed. I called every police station in every jurisdiction within range. It took a *lot* of explanation, but after hours of work there was nothing I could do but sit and wait nervously by the phone and stare at the empty apartment framed within my laptop screen.

All I could do was type.

*I’m here with you.*

*You’ll be safe.*

*This will be over soon.*

*You’re not alone.*

The ringing of the phone nearly sent me out of my skin. It was one in the morning.

“Did you find her?” I asked desperately, scanning the scene for any sign of activity. “Tell me she’s all right!”

The voice on the other end of the line sighed, a deep sigh, of sadness or frustration I couldn’t say. “We found her,” he said, his words gentle but guarded. “Stuck in that position, as you described. She’s… she’s not okay. She died of dehydration.”

“She – what? No. That’s not possible. I just spoke to her!”

“I don’t know what you saw, son. I truly don’t. But the girl we found has been dead for a month.”

nosleep,We’ve been stuck in construction traffic for 8 hours now. If we leave our vehicles we will die.,"Lauren is in the Honda Accord right behind my truck, with our two cats, but I can’t get out and see her. The last guy who got out was shot in the legs and then run over by a tank.

We set out yesterday from Gainesville, Florida, where Lauren had recently graduated from law school. We were moving to my home state of Maine, to start a permanent life together. The drive was beautiful most of the way, and Lauren and I spent a lot of time on speaker phone with each other to comment on it. A couple of times we passed through rain, and once a really wild thunderstorm that lit up the whole sky for miles. Then, about 8 hours ago, we hit a traffic jam on I-95 just outside of Lewiston, Maine.

I took a look at the navigation thing on my phone, but it didn’t show any red areas of heavy delay. It also had some trouble showing my exact location, though, so I lit a cigarette and figured it would just be a few minutes.

After about fifteen minutes, I called Lauren. “How’s it going back there?” I asked. In the background, I could hear the cats going nuts.

“Not great,” said Lauren. “Do you hear Hankie and Hattie howling? They started up as soon as we stopped. What's going on?”

“Must be an accident that just happened. My phone usually gives a heads up if there’s planned construction or something.” I heard one of the cats hiss while the other one yowled.

“I’m so tired,” said Lauren.

“I know, me too. Let’s stop and get something to eat once we’re through, yeah?”

“Okay.”

“Alright. Love you. Sorry about the cats.”

“Love you,” said Lauren.

I hung up and tried to get something on the radio. I have a base model 2006 Toyota Tundra, so no AUX jack, and the CD player had broken years ago. During the entire trip, I had been at the mercy of radio stations, and for the most part, they didn’t do much for me other than create a general atmosphere of annoyance.

Now, though, I couldn't even keep the radio on. What wasn't warbling static was some kind of distorted robotic voice reading off a list of numbers and random words strung together. Across the whole radio band, same thing. I couldn't take it so I shut it off.

I picked my phone back up and went to check Twitter. All I got was that game where you have to jump the dinosaur over cacti faster and faster and then it gets dark out and the birds come. No internet. Finally, Twitter did half-load, so there was *some* intermittent reception there, barely.

After a half hour had passed, I started to get antsy, and so did everyone else. People were sticking their heads out the window to try to see what was going on, but it was no use. The line of cars seemed endless. A few people got out of their vehicles to try to get a better look. I got out too and started walking to Lauren’s car.

When I was halfway there, a voice cut into the air. It sounded like someone shouting through a bullhorn. “Return immediately to your vehicles! No one is permitted to be outside! This is your only warning. If you do not heed it, there will be severe consequences.”

“Wha da *fuck* is goin’ on?!” some guy shouted in a thick Boston accent; he was standing a few car lengths in front of me. An instant later, he was down on the ground, not moving. I didn’t see what happened exactly, but that was enough to make me to hustle back to my truck.

I tried calling Lauren again. When she answered all that I could hear were broken flashes of the cats screaming and Lauren sounding scared and begging to know what was happening.

“I don’t know,” I said, not sure that she could hear it. “Maybe they’re searching for a criminal or something. I don’t know.” Then we were disconnected.

A minute later, an ambulance was wailing its way down the right hand shoulder. It stopped just past my truck, and two EMTs jumped out of the back. They closed the doors behind them, but I saw that there was somebody else in there. Somebody dressed in riot gear, holding a big gun.

The EMTs dragged the guy with the Boston accent by the arms over to the ambulance. They opened the doors and sort of tossed him in, and then followed behind. I saw the riot gear person again for a second, and then the doors slammed shut and the ambulance sped off down the shoulder out of sight.

Somebody four cars ahead of me got the idea to follow the ambulance out of there. I watched as a red Hyundai Sonata with a New Jersey license plate tore into the shoulder lane and sped after the ambulance.

I tried calling Lauren to ask her if she thought we should try it too. It was a ballsy move for sure, but she had sounded at the end of her rope stuck in there with our wailing cats, so I thought she might be willing to give it a shot. This time, the call didn’t even go through.

I was getting ready to try calling again when I heard this loud blast. A puff of smoke blossomed somewhere up ahead, and all of a sudden, there were chunks of a car flying through the air. A red car. Very likely a red Hyundai Sonata.

As I watched a flaming tire roll to a stop against the highway divider, I decided not to replicate New Jersey’s maneuver.

I heard the blast of a horn behind me, and looked in the rearview to see that Lauren had her arm out the window, moving her hand around in a circle. Finally, it hit me that she was telling me to roll down my window, so that’s what I did.

“Can you hear me?” she shouted.

“I can!” I could even hear the cats. They sounded really freaked out.

“What is happening?!” she asked.

“I don’t know baby! I think we’re in some kind of military lockdown maybe! I think we have to just sit tight here.”

“Can you throw me a bottle?” asked Lauren.

“What?”

“A bottle! Like Gatorade or something. I know that you’ve probably got ten of them in your front seat.

It was true. Not ten exactly, but close enough. I just threw all of my trash on the seat of my truck until it started overflowing, whereas Lauren kept her car clean. “What are you going to do with the bottle?” I asked.

“Not something I want to shout out for the whole world to hear!” said Lauren. “Let’s just say we’ve been here a while and I don’t think we’re coming to a rest stop soon enough.”

Finally, I understood. I reached over and grabbed a bottle. I chucked it out the window, but it was a bad throw, and bounced off the hood of Lauren’s Honda. I tried again, and this time she caught it. She rolled up her window and in the rearview mirror I watched her fuss around as she presumably tried to pee into the thing.

This was when the fleet of massive trucks started rolling in, on the southbound side of the highway divide. Some of them had cranes sitting on long flat beds, and others had big chunks of some kind of metal material. Soon, the southbound side was jammed up with these giant trucks and their haul. Then they started to get to work.

“What are they doing?!” asked Lauren. She’d opened her window back up. “Are they… building a fucking *wall*?!”

That is exactly what it looked like they were doing. One crane would take a massive chunk of material, and lift it into place either next to, or on top of, another chunk.

“Yes! They’re walling us in!” I shouted. I checked my phone for the thousandth time. I had a bar, and used it to call 911.

A lady answered. “What is the address for this emergency?”

“I… uh… I-95 northbound, just before Lewiston, Maine. I forget the exit number we were coming up on. I’m sorry.”

“That’s okay. What is the emergency?”

“Well… we’re in this weird traffic jam… and… people are dying here. Cars are exploding. They’re building a wall around us. They’re trapping us here. I know that sounds crazy….”

There was a long silence on the other end. I thought maybe we’d been disconnected. But then I heard her voice again, crystal clear.

“Sir, I am going to need you to remain calm and stay in your vehicle. And if you would, roll down your window. Not the driver’s side, the passenger’s side.”

“W… what?” I asked. Then I heard the tapping at my window. There was a lady cop standing there, holding a cell phone up to her ear. My heart jumped up into my throat, and my instinct was to slam my foot on the gas pedal, but there was nowhere to go. I rolled down the window.

“You reported an emergency?” asked the cop. “Everything looks okay to me. We don’t discourage anyone from calling emergency services if they truly think that there might be an emergency situation occurring, but everything appears to be perfectly fine here. I will give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but remember that we also very strongly frown upon fraudulent 911 calls. You could be charged for that, sir. It’s no joke.”

“Oh,” I said, trying to hold it together. “I’m sorry about that. I *did* think that something bad was going on, but now I see that everything is okay. Thanks for checking in.”

“It’s no problem at all, sir,” said the cop, smiling. “And remember: *stay in your vehicle*.”

“Of course,” I said, trying to smile, though I’m sure my face looked like a sweaty pretzel instead.

The cop nodded and then walked off down the line of cars. I waited a few minutes, and then called out to Lauren.

“I think we’re fucked!” I said. “I called 911 and that cop that was just here? She’s the one who picked up. She said everything’s fine… but it’s not.”

“Fuck!” said Lauren. “What do we do?!”

That’s when the guy jumped out of his car and made a break for the wooded area to the right of the highway. And that’s when they shot him in the legs. I heard him cry out and watched him hit the ground. I heard a loud continuous rumble, interspersed with snaps from the woods. Then I saw the tank. It didn’t so much emerge from the woods as it destroyed the woods in its wake. Beyond it, I saw another enormous wall. We were walled-in from two sides… and my guess was that we were walled-in from four sides.

The tank crushed the man like he was a particularly small ant.

\*

They are working on the roof now. It's almost done. Once the roof is on, I have a feeling that I won't get any reception at all. Before that happens, I'm hoping for one more spike so that I can get this post out.

I don't know if this is on the news or not. I thought it was just a traffic jam, so that's probably how they're playing it off. They probably have rerouted traffic around us by now.

I don't know what this is. But there are now dozens of heavily armed people in riot gear going from car to car. Sometimes they drag somebody out, and carry them screaming off to what remains of the wooded area, where they disappear from sight.

They're almost at my truck now. I hope they skip me, and Lauren. Oh God. I'm going to tell her that I love her.

If this reaches you, I don't know what you can do, but please try to help us.

nosleep,Because You Are My Baby,"My mother had the most beautiful teeth.

Her teeth are my first memory. I remember them: long and white and bared in a ferocious grin, shining under the full moon as she told me a story. Not a fairy tale or picture book, but *my* the story. The story of how I’d come to her…or rather, how she’d come to me. 

When I was very small – too small to remember anything at all – my mother stole me from a man, and took me to live in the forest.  She stole me not as an act of love, but as an act of revenge. Though I was desperate to know, she never told me what needed revenging.

One night, I finally asked, “Why won’t you tell me?”

“Because you are my baby,” she whispered in her low, wet voice. She stroked my face with long fingers. Her teeth glittered under the stars, rich and pale as polished ivory. “My baby will never hear, or see, or know the cruelties that haunt me.” 

Cruelty was not the only thing my mother knew that I did not, although it *was* the only thing she refused to teach me. My mother tried very hard to teach me everything else she knew. Unfortunately, I was a very poor pupil indeed.

My mother was a remarkable huntress. She felled elk and bear effortlessly. Sometimes she slid into the lake without so much as a ripple, and returned hours later with a monstrous fish clamped in her jaws.

Because hunting came so easily to her, Mother expected me to learn quickly. “Men hunt,” she hissed. “They have always hunted. So shall you.”

But I could not hunt. Not like her. My small, soft fingers were no match for her lethal claws. My clumsy little body – somehow so susceptible to both the heat and the cold – trailed after her whiplike predator’s form. Mother caught deer and foxes with her beautiful teeth, striking from the shadows like a snake. By contrast, my dull teeth could not even crush rabbit bones.

I persevered, but did not improve. One night, while Mother snaked through the shadows, communing with trees and evading the dark things prowling the night, I curled up and wept. 

She found me that way, weak and weeping. I covered my eyes and held my breath. I knew it was useless – Mother could hear my heartbeat from the other side of the hill, so she surely knew I was crying – but that small scrap of pride was all I had.

Mother stood there for a long while. Then she crept forward and covered me with fresh leaves before lying beside me. “I will feed you, always,” she whispered. “Because you are my baby.”

In addition to hunting, my mother was a phenomenal creator of shelters. Sometimes she lived within the earth, snaking through loam and tree roots like treasure-hoarding dragons of old.

Sometimes she lived in the trees. Many nights I watched in awe as her bones elongated and tore through her rough skin, stretching upward to twist among the branches like an ancient spider god. I would wait patiently, sometimes for hours, as Mother communed with the spirits buried in the roots.

And sometimes she lived in the shadows, creeping through the darkness to flush out food and threat alike. 

So, Mother tried to teach me to dig burrows. But I could not dig like her. I was too small and too soft, and far too frightened of the bugs and moles that tunneled through the earth.

So she tried to teach me to live among the tree branches, to rest and listen as the redwoods murmured the long, strange histories of the earth. But my bones could not stretch like Mother’s. I could not twist my arms to match the branches. My skin could not interlock with the treebark, and my blood was too sluggish to melt into the sap.

So Mother tried to teach me to live in the shadows. But the darkness terrified me. Every night, I hid and wept, imagining the legs of centipedes crawling across my skin. All the night creatures reveled in my fear; owls swooped down to taunt me and bats torpedoed toward me, giggling in their shrill, squeaking voices until mother slapped them out of the sky.

Finally Mother realized the futility of these lessons. So she dug a deep burrow just for me. She lined it with leaves and slurped the worms and roaches from the walls. When she finished, I burst into tears.

“Why do you weep?” she rasped.

“Because you do everything for me.” I knew the laws of nature. I knew the laws of forest creatures and their young. Young that were weak were killed in the nest. Young that could not learn to fend for themselves were abandoned to die. I was weak and soft and coated in terrible, ugly scars. “Why do you do everything for me?”

Mother snaked forward, long, large hands sinking into the earth. She curled around me and pulled me close. “Because you are my baby.”

Mother did not always live in the burrow with me. She roamed the mountains. She burrowed with moles, slithered with snakes, grazed with elk, hunted with wolves, stood with trees. 

When I was very small, I thought she ate the forest. But it was not that simple; she protected it, and in return it sustained her. “My heart,” she told me one rainy night, “is the forest, so this is how it must be.”

As I grew older, I developed rudimentary survival skills. I shied away from hunting big game – elk and deer, bears and boar – because I did not protect the forest. I gave it nothing; I only took, so I took as little as I could. I trapped rabbits, fished the streams, and ate wild berries. I dared take nothing else.

Once I could reliably feed myself, Mother stayed away for long stretches. Hours, then days, and finally weeks. I missed her terribly, with a deep, panicky ache.

I confronted her about it one balmy spring evening. “You leave me more and more,” I accused. “Soon you’ll leave me forever.”

“Never,” she murmured. A breeze twined around us, raising gooseflesh on my skin and rippling her long white hair. “I will never leave you.”

“But you do!” I screamed. “You already do!”

“Before you came, I lived among the trees, listening to their warnings. I slept in the warm earth as worms and centipedes nibbled my skin. I spent many of your lifetimes within the forest, little one – so many lives at a time that I forgot my own name. I do not leave you. I have left the forest for you.”

“I didn’t come here,” I sobbed. “You took me!”

“I did,” she said. “So I will never leave you. When you think I’ve left, silence yourself and listen. Listen for me the way I listen for the trees, the animals, and the stars. If you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”

And then she left.

Fury and jealousy seared my heart like a wildfire. She insulted me, she humiliated me, and after all that she *left* me. Left me for the centipedes and the wolves and the stupid, chittering bats.

“I don’t need you!” I screamed. An owl hooted angrily in response. “I don’t need you at all!”

Then I ran for my burrow. As it the earthen door materialized before me, nodding with flowers and wild grasses, anger swelled inside me. It possessed me, this wild ball of misery borne of my own endless fear and inadequacy. And it spoke to me.
*Why should you return to the burrow?* it asked. Why indeed? It wasn’t mine. It was Mother’s. The entire forest belonged to Mother. Without her, the forest would have consumed me long ago.

So I turned away from the burrow and kept running. *I will find the end of the forest,* I decided. *I will leave it once and for all.*

I ran for days, in the process treating the forest with contempt. I stripped the trees of their leaves to make nightly beds. I threw rocks at birds and rabbits. I uprooted bushes and stripped entire groves of their berries, eating until I threw up from sheer excess. Then I ate again. Not out of hunger, not out of any need, but out of malice.

And one day – long after spring ceded to summer in a verdant explosion of heat and greenery – I heard voices.

I froze immediately. The only voice I knew was Mother’s – wet and low, an earthy, rib-shaking whisper. These voices were nothing like Mother’s. They were high and somehow infantile, with strange, shrill notes.

These voices…they were like *mine.*

Trembling, I dropped low and crept through the underbrush. Sun-warmed leaves brushed against my face, smooth but painfully crisp; the sun was taking its toll on them. I snaked over the ground, pretending I was Mother, slipping through the forest like an invisible snake.

I reached a break in the trees and peered through.

In a small clearing were four creatures. They had pink skin and wore heavy clothing that looked suffocating. There hands were small and soft. Their faces were smooth and babylike, somehow half-formed: wide eyed and rounded, with soft noses and plump flesh.

I touched my face – flat and smooth - and looked down at myself: mudstreaked, deeply tanned, and marked with a hideous mass of scars, but still *soft.* Hairless, small, weak. There was no mistaking it. These things in the woods – these overdressed, half-formed beings with small teeth and no claws and overlarge eyes – were like me.

They were men.

I stood up, propelled by panicky excitement, and strode forward. All at once, they froze.

“What the hell?” one whispered. He lifted something in his arms and pointed it at me. It was long and strange to me. Inorganic, not alive, with a wooden handle and a gleaming tube.

Just then, I realized something: the forest was silent. A few birds chirped and sang, and a few bugs emitted their persistent drone. But the vast majority – birds, insects, trees – were silent. No rabbits, no deer, certainly no bears. These things – these creatures like me, these *men* - had silenced the earth.

They’d stolen the forest from itself. 

We stared at each other for a long time as ever-growing summer heat filled the clearing like an invisible pool.

“Mother,” I whispered. “Mother, please help me.”

She did not. So I turned and ran.

The men immediately pursued. I could hear them: yelling, crushing the undergrowth, stamping on blossoms and bugs, snapping branches as they ran. The forest’s deathly silence was worse than any cry.

“There it is!” one of them screamed. A second later, the forest exploded: a deafening *boom* shook the trees and ate through the air as pain erupted on my shoulder. I didn’t dare stop or look. I pressed on, running and crying as the men came after me.

The forest seemed to punish me for my earlier cruelty. Brambles scratched my legs. Stones cut my feet. Branches swiped at my face, leaving deep, stinging runnels. I thanked the forest for its kindness. I thanked it for punishing me, rather than stopping me. 

The men gasped and wailed amongst themselves. “What the hell is it?” “I don’t know. *I don’t know!*” “Is it a…a kid?” “Look at its face. Look at its fucking face! That isn’t a kid!”

Something suddenly filled my ears, drowning the sounds of the men and the forest. A deep, musical rushing, like birdsong transformed into a turbulent river.

And then Mother came, erupting from the trees like a great beast of old. But that’s what she was, after all. A great beast, surely a daemon of the ancient world.

She pounced upon the men, batting them the way a housecat bats its toys. She clamped one between her claws, squeezing until his head separated and went rolling across the ground.

One by one Mother caught and tore them, shredding them the way she shredded leaves for my bedding. Blood streaked the forest, turning the dirt to mud and dripping from the trees like sluggish rain. 

Mother dug her claws into the skull of the last survivor and cracked it open like a fruit. Blood and grey brain glistened in the sunlight. The man screamed, and screamed, and screamed.

Mother leaned down and extended her tongue. It curled outward, pale and orange-gold like sunrise on a cold, clear morning, and delicately slurped his brains. Curl by curl, like so many worms from my burrow walls.

By the time he stopped screaming, the forest had returned to its loud, familiar glory: murmuring trees, singing birds, skittering insects, grazing deer. 

I smiled and ran to Mother. She reared up and screamed, “*See what you’ve done!*”

Terror paralyzed me. I looked helplessly at her – blazing eyes, contorted face runneled with earth and wildflowers, sunbleached bone and pale, spongy rot. My mother, my beautiful daemon mother who claimed me out of revenge and raised me out of obligation, staring at me like I was a man.

“When you stone a bird, my heart stops! When you break a branch, my bones snap! When you selfishly strip the shrubs of their fruit, of their very birthright, my skin blisters! When you hurt the forest,” she roared, “*my heart bleeds!*”

I fell to my knees and hid my face. Mother rushed forward on her many limbs and wrapped long fingers around my throat. She lifted me up, dangling me over the forest floor. “I killed men for you! Now more will come! They will trample! They will cut! They will burn! They will kill! They will kill the bears and the cougars and the wolves, for they will blame the predators for what I have done for you! Do you see?” She shook me. The carnage below seemed to swing beneath me, a tapestry of blood-soaked earth and ruined corpses. “*Do you see?*”

“Yes, Mother,” I whispered. “I see.”

She dropped me. I hit the ground with such force it knocked the wind out of me. Mother pulled back and busied herself with one of the corpses. I looked up, shaking. Birds watched from the trees, quick and curious and full of condemnation. I averted my eyes as tears spilled.

Mother returned to me. She extended an arm and opened her hand. Upon her large palm were four eyes and a large, glistening heart. I stared at them blankly, then looked up at her.

“Four eyes,” she said. “One from each man. And the heart of the one that shot you. Eat.”

My lip quivered. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the gore in my mother’s hand. A heart and eyes. Raw and plump, alive just minutes ago.

“Mother,” I said. “Please.”

“Are you of me?” she asked. “Or are you of man?”

The forest became painfully silent. The animals, the trees, and the insects, all waiting with bated breath.

“I am of you, Mother.” I plucked the first eye from her palm. It was round and curiously firm, with a sort of firm, watery texture I associated with half-rotten fruits. The pink, wormy optic nerve dangled. For a terrible moment I thought I would vomit.

Then I raised it to my lips and bit in.

The eyes were awful, the heart even worse: thick and almost impossible to chew. Mother had to tear it for me, slicing it into manageable pieces with her beautiful teeth. 

When I finished, Mother picked me up and, holding me tightly, streaked back to the burrow as night fell.

That night, I became ill. I shook and shivered and hallucinated for days. My mind bled with images of dangling eyes and glistening hearts and skulls cracked apart like pomegranates. Mother lay with my all the while, soothing me with ancient songs like birdsong turned to rivers, and cooling me with her damp, earthy breath.

Finally the fever broke. I sat up, gasping as the last vestiges of my nightmare drifted away.

Mother sat across the burrow, hunched over tiredly. “You are well,” she said. “I am glad, for I must leave.”

I blinked tiredly. “Why?”

“Men,” she said. 

“But you killed them.”

“There are more,” she said. “They creep into the forest, searching for their dead brethren. They are cutting the trees and crushing the flowers and killing the bears, my little one. If I don’t stop them, they will even come for you. I have to stop them. My heart is the forest, and so are you. I must protect both.”

A lump rose in my throat. Shame like I’d never known enveloped me. “I’m so sorry.”

“You are my baby. Babies must learn. By learning, they grow.”

“Mother,” I said. “Am I truly of man?”

Mother closed her eyes. For a long time, she did not speak. Then she drew a deep breath. “I took you from a cruel man. Listen. I will tell you now of the cruelties I endured.”

I listened, enraptured and horrified, as she spun her sorry tale.

Mother was once a young, beautiful human woman.

“Surely not more beautiful than you are now,” I objected.

“Listen!” she said.

Mother was alone in the world. She had no family or friends. She once had a family, but they harmed her greatly so she ran away. She lived in the forest, in a small, ragged tent. She ate wild berries, fished the lake, and boiled water to drink.

Laws are strange things. Though Mother hurt nothing and no one, she was breaking the law by living in the forest. She was found, and caught, and imprisoned. Separated from the trees and the birds, Mother faded quickly. Though she was only jailed for a short while, it nearly killed her. The day she was released was the best day of her life…

Or so she thought.

No sooner had Mother gathered her meager belongings and exited the jail than a guard came up beside her. “Where are you headed to?” he asked. “I’ll take you wherever you want to go.”

Mother was ecstatic. “Take me back to the forest,” she said. The guard obliged, driving her toward the woods. Except he stopped too soon. He stopped at a house. His house, it turned out.

The guard was a terrible man. He trapped Mother. He hurt her, tortured her, abused her in every way. He cut her open, he burned her, he snapped her bones. 

And he put a baby in her. Mother was so broken that he missed all signs of impending childbirth. When I came, Mother died.

“He dumped me in a vat of acid,” Mother told me, “and scattered my liquid remains among the trees. But then I heard you.” Mother smiled faintly. Crumbles of dirt and root fell from her face. “I heard your cry. Your need for me.”

I do not understand what Mother said next; it is difficult to translate. But the closest I can come is this. Everyone sings a song to those they love. Most aren’t able to hear these songs. If you can’t hear, it can’t help you. But if you can hear it, a song is the most powerful thing in the world. It kills. It calls. It consumes. It destroys. It strengthens.

And sometimes, it resurrects.

“When I reformed and breathed again, I stole you from your father,” Mother said. “Then I brought you here, because you are my baby.”

I wept silently, because I didn’t know what to say.

“I must go,” she said. “The trees and the animals need me now. So remember, little one. When you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”

Then she whipped around – like a wolf, a snake, and hawk combined – and left.

She did not return.

At first, I thought nothing of it. I had made a terrible mess; I had summoned men. I had caused the forest to bleed. Mother had a great deal of work ahead of her.

But summer slowly bled into fall, and still Mother did not return. When the first snow came – dry and cold, skittering across the landscape like powder – I knew something was wrong.

The snows deepened. The forest drifted into its winter sleep, cloaked in ice and fog. Every night, I made myself silent. I mustered all the sincerity I could. And I listened for my mother’s voice.

It didn’t come.

I grew thin and sick. My skin burned even as I shivered. My chest grew congested, my throat so sore I couldn’t sleep. My breath came in sharp, pained wheezes.  Soon I became too weak to leave the burrow. I crawled to the doorway and ate snow. For sustenance, I slurped worms from the earthen walls. 

It was not enough, and I knew it.

Only then – in the quiet and peace and fear of approaching death – did I become truly silent. Only then did I hear the voice of my mother.

I heard her in my dreams: the low, rushing voice like music made into water. *I am coming,* she said. *I am coming, because you are my baby.*

I smiled, and slept. 

Next thing I knew, I was cold. Cold and wet and shivering, but *awake.*I shot up and screamed as my skin brushed the thick, flower-matted hide of my mother. I spun around, smiling, and froze.

Mother lay beside me, panting. Blood seeped from a hundred wounds, crusting her hair. The exposed bones in her face were crushed and concave, leaking gore and blood. Without opening her eyes, she smiled. “I heard you. I heard your song.”

Tears blurred my vision. My chest began to hitch. I couldn’t draw breath; it was like I was sick again, drowning in pus and trapped fluid. Only I wasn’t dying this time.

My mother was.

“Then stay,” I said. “You have to stay, because you can hear my song.”

“No,” she said. “You needed to see me again. But you do not need me.”

“I need you. Mama, *I need you.*”

“No,” she said. “I killed all who would harm you.”

“But what about the forest? The forest will kill me without you!”

She chuckled. Her breath came, terribly fast and increasingly weak. “You are of me. Remember. You are of me. You are my baby.”

My mother – my beautiful, ancient mother – drew a shallow breath, and lay still.

I lay beside her for many days. Then, when she began to stink, I left. A hiker eventually found me. A stupid, solitary hiker with a soft heart, a great deal of patience, and no fear.

When I learned to speak the words of men, the authorities lost no time in telling me that Mother was not really my mother. 

They discovered my identity (at least in a manner of speaking) through DNA. My real mother, they say, was a vagrant. A Jane Doe who lived in a tent in the national park. She was alone and defenseless, two things that attract human monsters. After a brief stint in jail for loitering, my mother ended up kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured by an as-yet unidentified assailant who eventually tried unsuccessfully to dissolve her in acid. They think he attempted to dissolve my body, too. That’s why I am covered in scars. It is why I frightened those hunters so long ago: the acid burns make me look like a monster to men.

Since my real mother apparently died long ago, they decided that Mother – whoever she was – was nothing but a crazy, homeless child abuser.

But I know better.

Even so, I adapted. I had no choice. I am of my mother, but I live among men. That’s what animals must do; their young learn, grow, and adapt. If they don’t, they die. 

But I am not adapting anymore. At least, I am not adapting to live among men. My mouth is changing. Changing in ways that are terrible to people, but wonderful to me. It’s my teeth, you see.

I am growing my mother’s beautiful teeth.

Looking at my teeth in the mirror was frightening and electrifying. Joy and terror ran through my veins in equal measure. It had to mean something. So I fell silent. I became sincere. I listened.

And I heard.

I heard the voice of my mother: low and rushing, like birdsong turned to a wild river. She tells me I do not belong with men, because I am her heart, and her heart is the forest. She tells me I must return.

And she tells me she is waiting for me, because I am her baby.

I spent the next five days watching Rachel die.

From the outside, just watching the monitor, it didn’t seem that different than what I had been watching for the past three years.  Rachel slept, she watched T.V., she read, and she painted.  But there were signs if you were looking for them.  She seemed tired and tense, and she had taken to sleeping more.  And occasionally, just every once in a while, she would glance up at the camera—at me.  It was then that I could see the fear and sadness in her eyes.

Inside…well, inside I felt like a burned out house collapsing in on itself.  At first I refused to watch, to do anything they wanted me to do.  Solomon didn’t get mad at me, but just shrugged.  He said while cooperation was preferred and could go a long way toward making my stay with them more comfortable, it wasn’t required.  

If he was right, Solomon said with a thin smile, things would play out as they were meant to, regardless of what I wanted or thought I chose.  Either way, he added, the video was about to start back playing and would not stop for another five days.  Whether I wanted to spend that time getting to see her again was entirely up to me.

I tried to not watch, but a part of me knew from the start I was going to.  Maybe I would find some clue that they were lying about her being dead.  Or Rachel could give me some advice or warning about what I needed to do next.  I didn’t know.  What I did know is that I couldn’t miss the chance to see her again.  And despite knowing in my heart that she was dead and everything on the video had happened a long time ago, I still felt that by watching I was with her somehow.  

She had been taken away from everything she knew when she was barely grown, trapped for years just for being special.  Experimented on.  Treated like property.  Kept from ever having friends or family or a life.  And yet through all that, she was still beautiful.  Not just on the outside, but on the inside too.  I had spent years watching her, getting to know her in a thousand tiny ways that so few people ever truly know each other.  I had seen her kindness and grace in her actions, even when she was fighting against the people holding her.  I had watched her strength when she woke up day after day in her prison and never gave up.  And I saw the beauty of her soul in her paintings, full of swirling colors and…what was the word…wonder.  She was able to paint these things she saw with such care and love, despite living in a world that had abandoned her so completely.

Well I wasn’t abandoning her.  I would watch every bit of the video I could manage.  Try to burn into my memory every frame of her I saw.  Not for them and their stupid project.  But for me.  And for her.  I may not have much left to do in my life before they lock me away somewhere or kill me, but I could do this one last thing.

Rachel wouldn’t die alone.

****

I watched nearly all of it, stopping only to eat quickly and use the bathroom until the last two days.  I would ask the guards to pause it, but they would only shake their heads and say Solomon said it had to play normally until it was finished.  By the fourth day, I was in a stupor.  I had already dozed some the first three days, but when I woke up on the fourth day, I could tell a few hours had passed.  There were two trays of food on the bed, one breakfast and another lunch.  I looked back at the screen in a panic, worrying I had missed something, but Rachel seemed to be just waking up too.  I noticed her putting her hand to her stomach as she got out of bed and felt my own stomach twist.  She was already hurting.  Rachel glanced at the camera and tried to smile before moving to set up a new canvas for painting.  

This was the second of three paintings she did in those last days.  The first had been the inside of an old-fashioned movie theater from the viewpoint of someone sitting in a back row.  On the movie screen was just the image of a sledgehammer propped against a brick wall.  I didn’t understand what it meant, and I found myself scanning the picture for some message or other clue.  Eventually I found what might be one, though I didn’t understand it either.

Rachel must have come to understand they knew what she was doing with the paintings and didn’t want to stop her, because these last three she set up much closer to the camera.  I was still squinting and studying the painting closely when I realized the flipped up seats in the next row up had brass number plates along the front edge of the seats.  Though they were upside down from the viewpoint of the painting, the angle was good enough that once I noticed them I was able to read them.  

**2…43…26…89**

I didn’t understand any of it, but I committed it all to memory, focusing all my attention on the painting until she finally took it away.  Even that early on I could tell painting was taking a lot out of her now, and like I had for so long, I found myself talking to her, telling her to go rest before I remembered her body in the next room.  I almost stopped then, but no.  Maybe she couldn’t tell I was talking to her, or maybe she could.  Either way, me talking to her couldn’t hurt, and it made me feel a little less lonely and sad as I watched her.

The second painting, the one she started after I woke up from falling asleep for a few hours, was stranger than the rest.  It looked like it was in a room with curved walls made of tree roots, and in the center of the room was a little table made out of the same stuff.  Some of the roots around the room were a deep red, but other parts, including the table thing, looked burned and black.  I looked closer and saw that I could see a person’s shadow over the table—hands holding some long oval-shaped bundle.

I studied it for a long time, going over it again and again in my mind after she took it away.  I couldn’t make sense of it.  Of any of it.  I wasn’t smart enough, and I was failing her.

Rachel slept for a long time after that painting.  Then she got up on the fifth day, her last day, and immediately started working again.  This time she was painting faster, and while I saw her wince occasionally, she never lost her look of determination as she slashed lines and colors across the canvas.  When she was done, Rachel picked up the painting and turned it toward the camera, giving me a small, tired smile as she was blocked from view.

It was looking out from the front porch of a house somewhere.  It was out in the country, and the morning view of the yard and the land beyond were wonderful, but closer-up the painting was of two hands.  Holding onto each other tightly, their interlocked fingers seemed to glow red and orange in the light of the rising sun.  I found myself crying as I looked at it.  

Part of it was because I didn’t know what it meant, and I felt a growing sense of desperation at the thought that Rachel’s last works might be wasted on me.  Part was because I knew it had been five days, and I could sense I was close to the end.  To her end.

But there was something more to it than all that too.  The last painting…even with everything else in my head and my heart pulling me down…gave me hope.  Hope of what, I didn’t know.  But I started to think that maybe the only message Rachel had for me in that last painting was that somehow, somewhere, everything would be okay.

Outside the edge of the painting I could see motion in the room.  People hurriedly coming in with some kind of medical equipment.  And then the monitor went black.

****

“You’ve done well, Thomas.  Very, very well.  For the last five days of video, we had charted one thousand and forty-seven microvariations in Rachel’s behavior that we believed might correspond to your behavior, your reactions, and your emotional states while watching the video.  Like before, the two of you remained in sync as though you were in the same room.  It really is remarkable.”

I sat staring at Solomon.  I listened to what he said, but I didn’t care.  I just wanted it over.  Whatever this was, I just wanted it over.

Clearing his throat, he went on.  “That’s why we’ve decided to move the implant from Rachel’s body to your own.  That’s one of the many reasons we’ve preserved her so.  The foreign body was still showing signs of life all this time, but just barely, and we were afraid to attempt removal.  Our hope is that, given your connection to Rachel, it will accept you.  Perhaps even thrive in you more than it ever did our girl.”

I was suddenly on my feet, and it was only the raising of Solomon’s gun that stopped me from attacking him.  “Don’t you fucking talk about her like that.  Like any of you gave a shit about her.  I’ll fucking kill you.”

Solomon’s face darkened slightly as his lips thinned.  “No, you won’t.  But if idle threats make you feel better, go ahead.  It will only make things harder, not easier.”

Feeling a stab of panicked fear, I sat back down.  “What is this thing you’re going to put in me?”

The man looked at me for several seconds before responding.  “I’m tempted not to tell you after your stupid—and frankly, hurtful—outburst.  But I’ll be the bigger person.”  Letting out a small sigh, he went on.  “Thomas, somewhere there is a tree.  A very special tree.  We suspect it is the same tree that Rachel painted for you that time, though we cannot say for sure, as we have never been able to find it.  It is either hidden away very well or it is able to hide itself from those it wishes.”

I just looked at him, trying to kill him by just wanting it to be so.  “In any case, we have the next best thing.  An ancient clipping from the tree.  Secured at great cost and sacrifice, and studied for a long time without much success.  We have, however, in recent years been given…advice, that this clipping could be grown in the right soil.  We thought that soil was Rachel, but while it did develop further inside of her, she died before the necessary growth was finished.”

Leaning forward, he smiled at me.  “We have it on fairly good authority, however, that you might succeed where she failed.”

****

I fought them when they came, but it didn’t matter.  I woke up some time later with a dull ache in my chest and a small, already healing scar on my upper stomach.  I didn’t really feel that different other than the little bit of pain, but I knew that would change with time.  Maybe I had more time than Rachel, or maybe I had less.  It didn’t matter.  I just…

*Wait, what was that?*

There was some kind of soft voice…coming from where?  It wasn’t in the room.  It was in my head.  I felt a thrill of excitement.  Maybe this was Rachel’s voice.  She had somehow stayed in the tree thing they had put inside me?

But no.  I had never heard Rachel’s voice, but I sensed this wasn’t it.  This voice was too delicate to really be heard or understood, and it reminded me of music coming from a distant room that you felt in the back of your mind without realizing it.  It was a…a melody, a kind of song.  But it wasn’t Rachel’s song.  I realized with a shiver that it was the song of the thing inside of me.

At first I was afraid, but that didn’t last long.  It wasn’t trying to hurt me.  It was trapped here just like I was.  *But*, it started to sing, *it was time for us to be free.*

I stood up and walked to the door, and as I did so, the lights went out.  The door in front of me clicked, and when I reached out and turned the knob in the dark, it opened easily.  How was this possible?  And if it could do this, why hadn’t it helped Rachel get out?  There was no answer, but there was also no time.  I could already hear boots around the corner as the glow from flashlights began to light up the far end of the hall.  

They would drag me back in there.  Chain me up or take this thing back out of me before we could get away.  If I was ever going to get out, it had to be now.  The voice was singing again, pushing me to go further into the dark, to run until we were safe.

So I listened and I ran.

****

Every door unlocked for me, every turn kept me barely out of sight.  The people looking for me were barking orders over a radio, asking someone what was the hold up on the generator kicking on.  Whatever the response, the hallways stayed dark as I drifted through them blind but not falling, lost but not being found.  

When I reached the final door, I opened it into a bright afternoon.  My lungs burned a little at the first fresh, unrecycled air I had breathed in a week.  Blinking, I waited for the voice to tell me where to go, but it had fallen silent.  I closed the door as panic began to rise in my chest.  All this and I would get caught because I didn’t know where to go.  I was outside a plain brown building in the middle of nowhere.  There was a road going off to the right, and to the left there was…

*Rachel’s forest, from her first painting to me.*

I knew it was the same forest immediately, and not just because of it matching the painting so closely.  I had some strange sense that felt like a kind of magnetism, or how birds know which way to fly.  Looking around for a second, I felt like I was being pulled when I looked again at those woods.  This was right.  Somehow, I knew this was the way I needed to go.

So I went.

I had made it to the edge of the forest when I heard the noise of men coming outside the building.  I thought about hiding, but I knew it was a bad idea.  They would just catch me, and I felt a drive to go deeper into the woods.  I plunged ahead, running at close to a reckless speed but never tripping or stumbling as I went.  I would occasionally hear a noise behind me as they spread out to search, but the sounds grew fainter as I ran.  I almost thought I had lost them for good when I heard a short cough that was quickly muffled off to my left.  Someone had gotten close without me knowing it. 

Panicking, I looked for any places I could hide.  There were only bushes and trees and…over there.  A well.  Not just *a* well, but Rachel’s well, with the same worn, grey stone walls capped with a weathered wooden lid.  I felt a moment of happy recognition, but then it faded away.  How did that help?  They’d check the well if they found it, and I didn’t have any way to get down in it without getting hurt or stuck.  Then an idea stuck me.

Crouching low and staying to the brush, I moved to the well and gingerly pushed on the lid.  At first it resisted, but when I pushed a bit harder, the wooden circle slid aside enough that you could clearly see someone moved it.  Glancing around, I eased back into the bushes as I heard soft footfalls approaching.

“We need to check this out.”

“You think he went down the well?  Better hope not.  He probably broke his neck if he did, and then its our asses.”

I could see the two men approaching.  Both of them were wearing dark body armor and carried assault rifles.  The older of the two shrugged back at the other one.  “Better that than he was hiding in there and we *didn’t* check.”

Looking irritated, the younger man nodded.  “I’ll look.”  He went over to the well and shoved the wooden lid aside, causing it to clatter to the ground.  Hitting a button on his rifle, a flashlight sprang to life on the barrel.  He started to shine it down into the well as the other continued to look in every direction.  I was worried he would see me if I moved, but I couldn’t wait.  I just had to stay calm.  Think slow and move fast.

I kept expecting to hear them yell, or feel something or someone strike me in the back, but nothing came.  As the afternoon light began to dim, I saw the trees thinning ahead.  I was approaching a road.  It looked like a normal, public road too, with several cars passing one way or the other as I walked out of the forest and up the hill to the asphalt.

The idea of hitchhiking, especially this close to where they held me, was frightening, but I saw little choice.  I was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt they had given me and my own shoes, but I had no money or ID or phone.  My only chance was to get far enough away that I could try and get help.

I jumped slightly at the hiss of hydraulic brakes as a large semi rolled to a stop next to me.  The passenger window rolled down and an older man with white hair and a greying mustache leaned over and peered down at me.  

“You look lost, son.  You need a ride?”

I looked down at the door of the truck.  It had a logo that said “Martinez and Sons Construction and Hauling”  Below it was a cartoon man hitting a wall with a sledgehammer.  Looking back up, I smiled at him.

“Yes sir, I do.”

****
I woke up five hours later as we pulled into a truck stop somewhere in Nevada.  I had planned on staying awake the entire trip, but that had only lasted a few minutes before exhaustion overtook me.  I glanced over at Oliver Martinez and he gave me a toothy grin.

“I’m tired, but you were plumb tuckered out.  I’ve got to fuel up, shower and get some grub.  I’m going on to California after that.  If you want to ride further, just be back here in an hour.  Sound good?”

I nodded and thanked him again for the ride as I got out.  I felt groggy from sleeping, but otherwise okay.  I just needed to decide whether this was a good spot to ask for help or if I should ride with Martinez further.  He seemed like a very nice guy, and he would probably try to help if he could, but I wanted to avoid putting more people in danger if I could help it.  Looking around, I saw we were in a fairly nice little town.  I decided I would go look around for a few minutes and then decide what to do.

I was only three blocks down the street when I saw the flickering lights in the distance.  It was a movie theater.  As I got closer, I felt my chest tightening.  It was the one from Rachel’s painting.

****

“Hey there.  Welcome to the Phoenix.”

The guy standing at the candy counter of the theater looked a little younger than me, and while he seemed friendly enough, he also looked slightly concerned.

“If you’re here for the horror double-feature, I’m afraid the second movie is about thirty minutes in.  I can give you a half-rate if you want to see it though.”

I shook my head and tried to not look as strange and crazy as I felt.  “No, that’s okay.  I…well, I recognized this place from a picture a friend of mine painted.  So I came in to ask if you knew anything about her.”

He raised his eyebrows and shrugged.  “Okay, weird.”  He smiled and added, “Weird but interesting.  Who is she?”

I swallowed.  “Her name is…well, it was, Rachel Donovan.”

I expected him to look surprised or excited or angry, but I could see right away the name meant nothing to him.  Shaking his head, he shrugged again.  “Sorry, that doesn’t ring a bell.  I’d say you could ask the owner, but he’s on vacation this week.”

Nodding, I searched my mind for something else to ask, some way to make this place matter the way her other paintings had.  “Is there anything unique about this place then?  Its history or something?”

The man grinned.  “Buddy, you’re clearly not from here.  This place is super boring.  Not just the theater, but the whole town.”  Frowning in thought, he added.  “The only thing I know about the history of this place is that there used to be a house here that burned down.  This was like in the 1920s or 30s when this wasn’t even a part of town.  Couldn’t tell you the first thing about it beyond that, but I still bet it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened here.”

I let out a disappointed sigh.  “Okay.  Well, thanks.”  I turned to leave when the guy called out again.

“Hey man, sorry I couldn’t help more.  If you come back, I’ll get you a discount on a movie.  Half-off.  If I’m not working, tell them Marshall said it was okay.”

I waved and tried to smile as I headed for the door with a heavy heart.  Why did you lead me here, Rachel?  What’s here that will help?

I was outside again, staring up at the theater’s bright blinking signs as though they were going to give me some kind of secret signal, when I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  There was an alley that ran along side the theater and went behind it to…something.  Whatever was back there, the light of a distant security lamp cast shadows along the wall of the alley, and those shadows were moving.

Instead of feeling afraid, I felt excited as I started down the alley.  Rachel had led me here, and I just had to trust that there was a reason for it.  Keep looking until I…

The shadows were made by leaves blowing in some wind I couldn’t feel.  As I got to the far end of the alley, I saw there was a small back yard behind the theater surrounded by a chain link fence, and on the other side of that fence was the tree from Rachel’s painting, with its deep red twisting bark and foam of green leaves waving to and fro in the night air.

I felt a surge of warmth in my chest as the distant singing began again.  This was the place.  The special tree that could not be found unless it wanted you to find it.  It sat at the edge of a small overgrown lot surrounded on all sides by buildings and yards, somehow forgotten when whatever this land had once been was divided up, and despite its location, I had a strong sense that I was the first to see it in a very long time.

Climbing the fence, I felt a jagged wire dig into my leg and rip my pants as I fell over the top.  I was bleeding a little, but I hardly noticed.  I could smell the tree now, and it was a rich, good smell unlike any I had smelled before.  Reaching out to it, I felt the singing grow louder as I touched it.  I felt stronger and less afraid then, and when I saw the light opening up at its roots, I didn’t tremble, I smiled.

There was a hidden tunnel under the tree.  A tunnel filled with sweet-smelling air that was like the tree smell but also different.  And the tunnel wasn’t dark—no, not at all.  It glowed with its own golden light that called to me, urged me forward.  Rain was beginning to fall as I looked around the dark lot.  I had the thought that I was leaving this world behind.

And I found I didn’t mind that much at all.

The tunnel had continued to grow, slanting down gently and tall enough that I walked in without stooping.  The roots of the tree went on and on, woven through the dirt walls as I went deeper.  I looked back and saw the tunnel had closed behind me, but I wasn’t surprised.  The way forward was the only way that mattered.

I walked for what might have been hours, but I never felt tired or hungry.  And I never worried I was lost, though I had no idea where I was or where I was going.  Still, I felt a surge of happiness and excitement when I turned a corner and saw something in the tunnel ahead.  As I got closer I realized it was a brick wall, but just as I began to think I had found a dead end, the wall faded away, revealing a dark room.

I paused at the edge of the tunnel, looking out at the floor of what looked like a basement.  It was empty, but in the light from the tree I could make out something scratched into the floor.  It was the number two.  I felt my pulse quicken as I thought back to Rachel’s painting with the theater seats, and then I stepped out into the room.

It was the empty basement of a house, and as I went up the stairs and opened the door, I saw that the rest of the house was empty as well.  No lights were on, but bright sunlight poured in through every window and in the distance I could hear what sounded like small waves crashing on a beach.  I wanted to go out and see where I was, but I forced myself to check the house first for any people or clues.  But there were none.  The house was utterly bare of any sign of people other than the number scratched into the floor below.

My nose tingled with salty air as I stepped outside.  The house was near the beach on what I soon figured out was a small, deserted island, and I realized with little surprise that I recognized the house from Rachel’s painting.  As I stepped off the porch, I saw no signs of people, but I wasn’t entirely alone.  Because sitting some distance from the house, was the tree.  

I knew it couldn’t be the same tree as in the abandoned lot, but at the same time I knew that it was.  Or at least a different part of the same tree that made the tunnels and appeared in my old world and whatever place this was.  

Because I had started having that thought as soon as I stepped out of the house.  I didn’t think this was my world.  Not exactly.  I could see a larger island some distance away, and it might have people on it.  Hotels and cars and planes.  Or it might not, as those things might not exist here.  Either way, my newfound intuition was growing stronger, and I could tell that the…what was it called?  The con…no, the texture of things was different somehow, if only a little.  Not bad or scary, just different.

Still, after a couple of hours exploring the island and checking the house, I began to feel terribly lonely, even with the tree nearby.  I decided to go back into the tunnel and keep going.  The basement wall faded away as I walked up to it, and I entered the tunnels again.

It was only a short time later that I found my second version of the house.  Much like the first, the wall faded away into a basement, but this one was far from empty.  It was a workshop of some kind, full of tools I wasn’t familiar with.  I glanced down and saw “43” scratched onto the floor.  Who was doing that?  And why?

I was going to explore the house, more carefully this time, as it looked like there were people here, but then I froze.  Propped against the brick wall, next to a small stack of boards, was a sledgehammer.  Trying to be quiet, I crept over and picked it up before heading back into the tunnel.

****

When I was little, before Daddy died, he had loved to hunt.  I never went with him and didn’t remember much of what he hunted, but I do know he had an old hound he’d had since before I was born.  The dog had only loved him—well, him and being on the trail of something.  When Rocker (his name was Rockerfeller) got a scent, it was like he was in a trance.  He would go and go, this way and that, and to look at him, it looked like he was having a fit—both lost and certain at the same time.  But whatever Rocker knew or didn’t know, he always found what he was looking for. 

I felt like Rocker now.  I was moving faster and faster as I went down this turn and that.  I felt like I was on the trail of something or traveling on memories I didn’t have.  Gripping the sledgehammer tightly, I could hear the rising hum of the distant music in my head as I turned the last corner, and then it fell silent.

There was another brick wall, and as I approached, it fell away.

It was another basement room, but this one was much smaller.  It contained a table, a clothes chest, and an old metal bed that had been broken apart.  At the far brick wall, a woman was using one of the metal legs from the bed to attack the wall and whatever lay behind it.  I felt my head began to swim as I looked at her from behind, and as she turned to look at me, eyes wide with surprise and fear, I felt the sledgehammer slip from my grip as I stumbled back against the now solid wall.  I could barely breathe at all, but I managed to get out a single word.

“Rachel?”

The woman looked at me, her expression less fearful but still guarded.  She had the bed leg partially raised in warning.  [“Yeah?  Do I know you?”](https://redd.it/8uj33q)

It was her, but it wasn’t, much like the tree on the island.  This Rachel looked a few years older, and while she looked stressed and confused at the moment, her eyes didn’t seem weighted down by the same quiet sadness I had come to recognize watching the other Rachel for all that time.  Still, I didn’t know how to answer her question and not sound creepy or crazy.  I stared at her for a second, floundering, when she asked another.

“You came out of the tree tunnel, right?”

I nodded, grateful for something I could answer easily.

Studying me, she said.  “Where did you come from?  Before the tunnel I mean.”

I flushed as I tried to think of the right words.  “Um, well, I came from Texas.  Originally I mean.”

She grinned at me for a second before catching herself and trying to look serious again.  “Yeah, okay.  But like…do you know how the tree works?  How did you find out about the tunnel?  How did you get here?”

Sighing, I rubbed my head and just started into it.

“Look, I know this will sound crazy, but I had a job watching a woman trapped in a room, and that woman was you, or another version of you, and she asked me for help, and I couldn’t help her and then they took me, and I found out she had been dead for a long time but could see me in the future and then they put something from the tree in me that had been in her that killed her and then I escaped and then I figured out where to go to find the tree from things she had painted and I somehow knew how to go in the tunnels to find different spots, and I’m pretty sure the tunnels lead to different worlds and I got this sledgehammer and then I…”

“Hold up.  God damn.  Take a breath.  You’re going to pass out.”  She was smiling again, and this time she didn’t try to hide it.  She looked over what was left of the bed to where the sledgehammer was laying on the floor.  “And did you say sledgehammer?”

**Whack**

“So yeah, I believe you.”

**Whack**

“I’ve been in those tunnels too.  My ex-boyfriend tricked me into moving here so he could tie me to the tree in his place.”

**Whack** 

“Well, not tie me to the tree literally.  Take his place as…what?  The tree’s buddy or something?  I don’t really know.  It’s all pretty fucked up and I don’t understand all of it.”
**Whack**

“But what I do understand is that the fucker walled me up in here.  At first, I thought I could just pry loose some bricks over time, but nope.  He put a layer of concrete on the outside this time.  Good ol’ Phil.  Or Justin.  Or whatever.  I mainly think of him as Fuckface now.”

**Whack**

“This is taking forever.”

I stepped up and put my hand on the sledgehammer.  “Let me do it for a bit.  We can take turns.”  We had cleared away even more brick than she had already managed, but the concrete wall was only starting to show small cracks.  I wanted to just keep looking at her, have her talk to me, but I knew she was tired.  She nodded reluctantly and let go of the hammer.  Before I swung, I looked back at her.  “How long have you been in here like this?”

**Whack** 

Rachel scowled.  “It’s hard to say for sure, but I think about eight months.”

I let the hammer drop down again as my eyes widened.  “How did you survive all that time?”

Her scowl deepened.  “It’s the tree.  It won’t let me die.  I just dip into the tunnel every day for a bit and I never get that hungry or thirsty.”

A thought occurred to me then.  “Why didn’t you just escape through the tunnels?”

She quickly shook her head.  “No, thank you.  I’ve had enough of seeing other worlds.  Some of them aren’t so nice.  And I don’t want to be more tied to the tree than I already am.  I just want out of here, into my own world, and then I can try and figure out how to get free of my connection to the tree for good.”  Rachel shrugged.  “I would have done it eventually with the stupid bed parts, but who knows how long it would have taken?”  She smiled again.  “I’m very happy you came to help and brought a sledgehammer with you.”

Returning her smile, I nodded as I lifted the hammer again.  “Me too.”

**Whack**

****

We were both wringing with sweat when we crawled through the hole we’d made in the outer wall.  Rachel told me that she thought her ex-boyfriend was long gone, but she couldn’t be sure, so we had to be careful.  Grabbing the sledgehammer from inside the room, we made our way toward the stairs.

The house was decorated but quiet, and we saw no sign of anyone as we walked to the front door and opened it.  Outside, the sun was coming up on a new day, and as we walked out onto the porch, I jumped a little as Rachel took my hand and gave it a squeeze.  I looked over at her.  

I hadn’t been able to help the other Rachel, but maybe that had never been the point at all.  Because I thought now she had been able to see more than just other places or the future.  She had been able to see into other worlds and possibilities. 

Like this one, where another version of her was trapped and needed help.  A place where I wouldn’t be hunted and she could be free.  In the end, even when she knew she was dying, Rachel had been determined to help us be together and happy.

The morning sun painted beautiful colors on Rachel’s face, and looking into her eyes I saw how much she was like the woman I had watched and cared about and tried to save.  The woman who, in the end, had saved me instead.  I wanted to tell Rachel so many things, ask her so many questions, but all that could come later.  Squeezing her hand back, I walked with her away from the house.

**TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP DMing ME ID THE STORY IS TRUE**: Please see the description and nature of the subreddit where it is posted.
  


  
You probably heard about tourism in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. I’ve been there myself several times. And it’s nothing like what you see in games or horror movies. There are no ghosts, mutants or radioactive anomalies and death isn’t waiting for you at every corner. Actually, I think it’s one of the most peaceful and prettiest places on Earth. An example of strength of nature and how it can reverse the damage that we caused it.

Thus, when my friend Alexei decided to go there, he knew who to contact. He's a physics student and right now he’s doing some kind of research on nuclear fallout and he said that he wanted to get some direct measurements and samples. But we both knew that it’s just an excuse to go on an “adventure”. We visited the old powerplant, the abandoned city Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone. It was nice, but I would probably just bore you with more details. That part is not important anyway.

&#x200B;

We were driving on some dirt roads in a forest east of Pripyat when we found it. An old, rusty fence and a chained gate that blocked any further passage. There was a big sign with a radiation hazard symbol and captioned: “Restricted area. Authorized personnel only”.

There was a pair of massive metal blast doors in the side an artificially-looking hill not far behind the fence, with a large, white “O-13” painted on it and “NO ENTRY” sprayed on top.

“What do you think it is?” Alex asked.

“I don’t know, looks like some kind of bunker,” I replied. “And it looks like it has been closed for some time,” I added after taking a closer look at the doors. The both halves were welded shut in the center. Alex took his samples and readings, but we were too puzzled to leave just yet.

“Do you think we can get in?” I asked.

“Well not this way for sure. Even if it wasn’t welded sealed, I’m sure we have no way of unlocking it.” Alex replied while examining the massive door.

“It looks like an underground bunker. They must have had a way to pump air inside and I don’t think this is it. There has to be another way to get in.” I said.

We circled the main entrance to try find other means of entry. The day was already coming to an end and it was slowly getting darker. As we were searching, a thought crossed my mind.

Why would they weld the doors? What’s so important inside that they went this far to keep people away?

“Look, there’s something there,” Alex pulled me away from my thoughts.

It was a concrete block a couple of meters large with what looked like vents on the sides. As I looked into the vents, I noticed that they were also sealed with heavy-looking steel hatches and no clear way to open them. However, there was also a somewhat smaller door labeled “Service tunnel” with a large wheel on the outside.

“Should I open it?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’m really wonder what this is. Anyway, we don’t have to go in. At least we’ll see if the door still works.

At first, the wheel wouldn’t turn because of all the rust and dirt, but eventually it budged. The door unlocked. I pulled and it slowly started opening. It was very heavy and took a lot of force.

Behind the door, there was a small platform and a tight vertical tunnel with a ladder. What caught my attention was that there was an identical locking mechanism on the inside. That meant that they could lock the door from both sides. But why? We were lucky, because if they had locked it from the inside too, there would be no way to get in.

I stepped inside and shined my phone light down the shaft. It wasn’t strong enough to hit the bottom. The air was damp and old and there was something that I couldn’t identify. A very faint, chemical-like smell. There was no radiation nor signs of any other hazards.

“You’ve got to be kidding me. This is so cool. We have to come back here and check it out later.” Alex said.

I couldn’t agree more.

It was almost dark now, so we resealed the door and called it a day. But we promised ourselves to return.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I immediately tried to do some research when I got home, unfortunately with no success. I even tried to call Pavel, a friend of mine who knew the area better than me. Actually, it was him who brought me there for the first time. He couldn’t help me either, but promised to ask around. I told him about our plan and asked if he wouldn’t go with us, but unfortunately, he was out of the country for a while.

A week later, we packed our gear and went on with it. We brought some rope, heavy flashlights, glowsticks, Geiger counters, waterproof protective clothes, an oxygen meter and a small emergency scuba tank just in case. And yeah, we’re not stupid so we told our relatives and friends about our trip and when we’re expecting to return.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We closed the door behind us as we descended down the access shaft. We couldn’t know what’s down there and we didn’t want to cause a radiation leak or something like that. We eventually dropped down into a concrete tunnel which enclosed the air vents and some smaller pipes. There was obviously no power and thus no lights. Good thing we brought our own.

We followed the tunnel and reached another door, but this time it was a regular one, not the heavy bunker-type. We went through and entered a room with 4 large air pumps and some electrical equipment and controls. The ventilation shafts split here into two larger ones that ran straight into ground and two smaller ones that went straight across the room where there was another set of doors.

Behind the doors, there was a large hall with numerous boxes, crates and other cargo just laying around. There also was a security checkpoint. Behind the checkpoint, we found the main door that we have seen from the outside. Just next to it, there was some heavy lifting equipment. We returned through the checkpoint and taken a look at a set of elevators. There was a simple map with the layout of the facility floor by floor. We were on floor 0, main entry hall. There were another 4 floors below us.

&#x200B;

Floor -1: Offices, security and recreation

Floor -2: Secure laboratories

Floor -3: Accelerator, Cleanroom decontamination chamber

Floor -4: Experiment site

The map was titled “Object-13”. It wasn’t a military bunker. This was a research site.

&#x200B;

We took a set of stairs, since the elevators were of no use without power. An unsettling thought brushed my mind as we were descending. They probably were moving some supplies, and then left them there and took the equipment to the main door. Were they trying to get out?

I stepped on another stair step but something rolled away under my foot, lost my balance and fell on my back. My pack luckily absorbed the impact. I looked under my feet to see what caused my fall. Empty bullet casings.

This wasn’t the sole reason why I felt odd about this place. As soon as we got down to level -1, I noticed that every single door was open. Every single one. There was a canteen and a kitchen right at the beginning of a long rectangular corridor. Various offices surrounded the corridor. There was the regular stuff – paperwork, old computers, personal belongings, all right there where they left it. Did they leave in a hurry?

“Dimitri!” Alex called from, the canteen on the opposite side of the corridor.

“What?” was all I could say when I followed him to the canteen.

There was food still neatly served on the tables. But it wasn’t spoilt. It wasn’t fresh either, but it wasn’t decaying, as a 30-year-old meal should.

“How is this possible?” I asked.

“I don’t know, maybe it was irradiated or something. But it’s not anymore, I checked that. I really don’t know man,” he answered, as puzzled as I was.

Oh, why didn’t we just turn back and leave? Now that I’m writing this, there were so many red flags already. Something really wrong happened down there. But I guess we were too excited and curious. But it was at this point that my excitement started to fade and be replaced with an eerie feeling.

Nevertheless, we continued and descended down to level -2. The stairwell ended here, and to go deeper, we would have to cross the entire floor to reach an another one on the opposite side. There was a security checkpoint and a large blast door that we had to pass through to reach the labs. Again, every door was wide open. However, the things that people left here weren’t neatly placed where they should have been. It was a mess everywhere. There were all kinds of rooms with all kinds of equipment that I didn’t understand. Occasionally, there were more empty bullet casings on the ground. There still was the one central rectangular corridor as above, but the rooms around it were like a little maze.

Almost at the other side of the floor, we found the head scientist’s office. As I said, everywhere it was a mess, but I found a logbook on the desk. There was only a handful of pages, the rest torn out.

&#x200B;

**5. October 1984:** Today we successfully managed to translocate several atoms without changes in any physical properties. It’s going to be a long road until we can transport solid objects, but we’re going some good work here.

**17. January 1985:** We’ve managed to transport an apple today. However, I couldn’t help but notice that the pattern of red and green skin on top was slightly different. But it was still the same apple, with the same structure, shape, everything. We also tried to transport some electronics. They were unharmed and in working order. I think that we still have a lot to perfect and learn about this technology, but we cannot slow down now. The country is relying on us.

**21. February 1985:** After the animal trials, we translocated our first human today. He is alive and healthy, a brave hero of our nation. We have proven that this technology works now, but the practicality is still very limited due to the fixed translocation ratio. We still cannot “send” matter. Only exchange the positions of two equally massive objects. I have proposed a new type of device, that could possibly achieve one-way translocation of just a single object, but it would need an immense amount of energy.

**1. May 1985:** Our superiors accepted my proposal. They are going to build a new, much bigger translocator here, in the power plant, so we can use a nuclear reactor as a direct power source. There is one more thing. We’ve now translocated dozens of test subjects. Each one is alive and well, but sometimes they are a little bit, well, different. They sometimes claim that various events in the past happened differently than they really did. Sometimes they claim to know people who don’t exist, or more alarming, they know people who they are not supposed to know. The following was written below with a pencil by hand: “Test subject 28 was speaking an unknown language and couldn’t understand any real language after the experiment.”

There was a lot of missing pages afterwards.

**25. April 1986:** We are going to try to change our approach. It’s been more than a year, and we’re still unsuccessful in eliminating the translocation symmetry anomaly. We still event don’t know what is causing it, but we are not going to make any progress this way. Today, we are going to try to access the conduit reality instead.  Even though Unit 2 - the one we built in the power plant - is still new, we are going to use it for this experiment. Who knows what wonders are waiting for us on the other side?

There was one last page in the logbook. On it, it was just a single phrase, written again and again:

# “WE LET THEM IN”

&#x200B;

“Alex, I think we should go,” I called.

“Man, come take a look at this,” he answered.

I stepped out of the lab and back into the hallway.

There were … clothes all over the corridor. Well what was left of them. They were torn to shreds. No bodies, no blood, just strips of cloth and an occasional shoe or a watch.  I looked up and stared down the dark corridor in front of us. I just stood there for a while.

&#x200B;

It was, I don't know ... as if something torn all these people to shreds, and then cleaned it all up. Except the clothes and other non-organic material.

&#x200B;

A wave of pure, instinctive dread washed over me. I couldn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.

“Let’s just get out of here.” Alex said.

We turned around and walked away. Slowly at first, but we quickened our pace. Our footsteps echoed across the underground structure.

“I just want to be out of here man. We shouldn’t have done this” Alex said. I didn’t tell him about the logbook, but…

My thoughts were cut short after a sudden realization.

His voice didn’t echo. It was just our footsteps.

I think he realized too, because we both stopped and listened.

Nothing. Just silence.

I stepped forward.

*Clack.*

I took another step.

*Clack.*

There was this door just in front of us and I forced myself to try something. I closed it behind us as we passed it and placed a glass beaker that I found on the ground on top.

I took a step forward.

Silence

It was just echo after all, I thought.

We walked away, carefully at first, but then we once again quickened our pace. We turned around a corner, and then it happened.

&#x200B;

*Crash*

The glass shattered.

&#x200B;

Someone

or some thing

&#x200B;

just opened the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We dropped all our gear except our lights and ran as fast as we could. I didn’t even know I could run this fast. I always tried to be a tough guy but I was never so scared in my life.

Our footsteps didn’t echo anymore. Or better said, they weren’t in sync with ours anymore. Something was running after us. Each second it was getting closer. And closer.

As soon as we reached the security checkpoint, we started closing the door. The rusty joint of the door squealed in protest, but we pulled with all our strength. We almost had it closed, when we heard a loud, guttural and unnatural growl.

The door slammed shut and I threw the wheel to the ‘locked’ position. My heart was pounding so hard that it was all I heard for a while.

No, wait, it wasn’t my heart. It was that thing, pounding on the locked blast door.

&#x200B;

We were running again. We reached the stairwell and run up, taking 2-3 steps at once.

We finally reached the air pump room. The ascent really exhausted us and even though I was scared shitless, I felt like I would pass out if I took another step forward. Besides, we locked it down there.

Alex sat down and leaned his back on one of the large vertical vents with a bang.

*Bang. Bang. Bang…*

&#x200B;

Oh fuck.

We locked it down there.

But we forgot the vents.

&#x200B;

Alex and I looked at each other, our eyes met, and then… the vent burst and he was gone. I only heard him scream as he was dragged back down.

&#x200B;

I feel terrible for doing this, but I just ran, I climbed the service shaft and locked the service door shut when I was finally out of this hell.

As soon as I had phone service again, my phone started beeping with loads and loads of missed calls and messages from Pavel.

“Hey Dimitri, I found this guy, he says he knows what ‘O-13’ is. Please pick up as soon as you can, he says it’s dangerous and you should stay out of it.

“This guy is calling me now, he sounds serious, please call me back at once”

“I don’t know what’s going on but he’s going there, please I hope you get this before you go down. Stay safe friend.”

There was also one message from an unknown number:

“Dimitri, this is Anatoliy Moroz, I know what you found and I’m on my way from Kiev now. DO NOT GO DOWN THERE. If you already did and you manage to get out, lock the door that you used to get in and make sure it stays locked. I will try to call you when I’m here.”

&#x200B;

So here I am, writing this while I wait. I do this to make sure that no one else repeats our mistake, since I don’t know if I’ll live long to tell anyone personally.

&#x200B;

I just can’t leave Alex behind.

&#x200B;

I have to go back.

nosleep,They paid me $5000 to go through hell,"It was the advertisement’s outright simplicity that caught my attention.

“Revolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!”

I wish I could say I didn’t know why I called them. I wish I could say it was some act of God or deception that drove me into their waiting arms. But that would be a lie. The truth is I called them because I needed the money. Because I had gotten laid off at the publishing company I worked at and I was having trouble finding steady work. Because I was months behind on rent and facing my second eviction notice. Because I didn’t want to be a failure.

I called them for selfish reasons.

Who are they? I’m not exactly sure. In retrospect, their obvious obfuscation of their identity should have been a red flag to me. But at the time, their request seemed too interesting, their reward too vital, for me to risk losing the chance to help them. My best guess is that they’re a group of private researchers that are funded by some super-corporation. They must be. Otherwise, there was no way they would have been able to pay for the machine.
They showed me the machine the first time I met with them. It was kept in a cavernous room in the basement of a five-story office building. It was a work in progress at that time – they were still connecting pipes and soldering wires. But even in an unfinished state, it looked truly magnificent.

“Have you ever heard of a sensory deprivation chamber?”

I had. In fact, I had actually been inside one before, when I was in college. Back then, I was on a real hippy-dippy spiritual journey. You know, meditating a lot, experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Primarily magic mushrooms. At some point along that journey, I felt motivated to spend an hour of my life (and sixty dollars of my student loans) inside a sensory deprivation chamber at a local spa.
Your standard sensory deprivation chamber is a large metal tank filled with about a foot of salt water. You step in and float in the water, then someone (a spa attendant, in my case) closes off the tank so it’s completely dark. With your vision obscured and your body suspended in the water, it’s supposed to feel like you no longer have your two primary senses. Depending on who you ask, this is supposed to be relaxing, enhance your creative process, allow you to reach higher consciousness, hallucinate, or maybe gain magic powers.

My experience with the chamber in college was fairly lackluster. I remember that the water was too frigid and the salt made my skin itch. It was difficult to concentrate on meditating or channeling my inner chakra or whatever the spa had promised. Truthfully, I did always wonder what it would have been like to get in one of those things while tripping on some magic mushrooms, but I never had the opportunity.
This sensory deprivation chamber didn’t look anything like the one I used in college. This chamber looked like a vivisected suit of medieval armor strewn across a large metal table. Thousands of tubes and wires connected to the metal body, which was about three times larger than my own body. The head or “helmet” of the chamber was collosal and round with a big brass pipe running out of its crown into the tiled-floor beneath it. On the walls surrounding the chamber were fifty or sixty computer screens, twenty or so server boxes, and various iterations of medical equipment that I couldn’t name if I tried. 

It dawns on me now that the utility bills and computers alone for the machine must have been many tens of times higher than the measly $5000 they offered me, not to mention the salaries of the dozens of labcoat-clad scientists manning those computer screens. Again, perhaps this should have raised alarm bells, but I ignored it with the focused ignorance of a man who was on the brink of homelessness.
The man who showed me the machine told me his name was Dr. Monason. He was a wrinkled, balding man with a clean shave and focused eyes of blue. When I saw him, he was always clad in blue scrubs and a clean white labcoat. 

Dr. Monason was the primary liaison for my involvement on this project. He explained the machine’s purpose, brought me the necessary waivers, and answered all my questions.

Questions like, “So what exactly am I supposed to do?”

“We want you to remain in our sensory deprivation chamber for three days.”

I’m sure my expression betrayed my sense of shock. 

“Three days? Is that – I mean will – Will that kill me?”

“You probably would still be alive after three days in pure isolation, though you would likely become gravely ill and suffering from immense dehydration. Regardless, the machine will hydrate, feed, and otherwise sustain you during the experiment. So there is no risk of bodily harm.”

Dr. Monason went on to explain how the machine worked.

“In your standard deprivation chamber, the occupant is deprived of their sense of sight, feeling, and, to a lesser extent, hearing. This deprivation, this process of shutting the outside world out from the occupant’s mind, decreases the burden on their brain. Thus, the occupant’s mind is free to wander more freely – free to think more creatively, to undergo a deeper state of thinking, to meditate, and so on.

“But there is a problem with standard sensory deprivation chambers. Although the brain is freed from most external stimuli, the visual and auditory, the brain will continue to be burdened by internal stimuli. That is to say that the brain is still very aware of its own carrier – the human body. The brain will still react to the hunger and thirst of the vessel that carries it. It will still process both the need to and the action of urination and defecation. These internal interruptions go on and on, but the point is that standard sensory deprivation chambers cannot truly be said to deprive the occupant of their senses.

“This machine is not your standard sensory deprivation chamber.”

Even a cursory glance at the machine made clear what the doctor meant. 

“The inside of the exoskeleton portion of the machine is lined with a soft rubber that will acclimate to maintain the exact temperature of human skin. The tubes and wires control and regulate a wide variety of bodily functions. Through these tubes, the body is automatically fed and hydrated. The unsavory functions of the body are handled with a catheter and another series of tubes. A respirator automates breathing and regulates saliva production.

“Even the body’s natural sense of touch is completely removed while in the machine. This IV cord injects a numbing solution into the bloodstream that completely shuts off all feeling. The numbing agent is the most critical asset of our sensory deprivation process.”

The list went on and on. It became clear that they had truly accounted for everything.

Even for me. I was one of hundreds of applicants to be part of the experiment. For the first time in my life, I was the first round draft pick. The scientists explained to me that I had been chosen for three reasons.

Number one: I had no prior history of mental or physical illness that would make my experience in the chamber subject to “intervening variables.” Their words, not mine.

Number two: My height and weight were close matches for the machine’s original shape. 

“Although the legs will have to be lengthened ever so slightly, you are by far the closest match to our initial design.”

And number three, the most critical: There was nothing happening outside of that chamber that would lead to an early termination of the experiment. I had no significant other, no job, no living family members – not even a houseplant to take care of. They could breathe easy knowing that I would remain peacefully within their contraption for the entire length of the experiment.

Number three was important to the scientists. They had specifically designed the machine to allow for three full days of isolation. If the machine’s process had to be interrupted early, it would take them a month to reset the machine and run the experiment again. 

Unfortunately, reason number three also meant there was nobody to come looking for me.

The intake process was long and detailed. I signed what felt like hundreds of liability waivers. I listened to warning after warning about the potential side effects.

“Although it is apparent that you have a clean bill of health, you should be aware the isolation process may be taxing on you. Our preliminary research suggests that disassociation, audio and visual hallucinations, depression, time dilation, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other neuroses are potential effects. However, we believe such effects to be unlikely.”

They had given me several weeks to prepare for the experiment. My only requirement during that time was that I didn’t substantially change my bodyweight or somehow develop bipolar disorder. Somehow, I managed. I spent those few weeks living normally – watching movies, applying for jobs, getting rejected for those jobs, and reading a few books.

When the day came, I was nervous despite Dr. Monason’s efforts to prepare me.

“The process will come in stages. At first, you may endure a mild state of stress. We anticipate that soon after, you will drift into a moderate state of euphoria for the remainder of the process. You will be signaled a few minutes before the experiment is over by a short audio queue. This way, you will emerge from your state of sensory deprivation slowly and be able to re-acclimate without any risk of shock.”

He played the audio queue for me, which was a short musical clip of bells ringing. 
Then, with little ceremony or deliberation, I was asked to asked to remove my clothing and climb inside the machine.

As I lay down inside the exoskeleton, I felt the warm rubber against my bare skin. Even with the chamber still open, I was confined on all sides by the metal shell of the machine. Slowly, the researchers began to attach a score of medical devices to my body. I felt strangely calm through every prick of an IV and uncomfortable insertion of a tube.
But, as a respirator was placed on my face, I began to feel a foreboding sense of unease. As I felt my body being constricted and held in place a single thought filled my mind.

Oh God what have I done.

The researchers pushed the helmet of the exoskeleton inward on either side of my head, sealing off my ears. The world went quiet. A bead of sweat began to trickle down my sides. Then I heard a voice, seemingly broadcast from inside my own head.
“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. Your vital signs indicate that you are beginning to panic. This is to be expected. Please do your best to relax while we finish preparing you. I promise that the process will become pleasurable soon enough.”

Somehow telling me to relax just made me more anxious. Before I could react, I felt the machine close around my body. Already the numbing agent that was being piped into my bloodstream was starting to take away control of my extremities. I tried to push against the machine but found that my arms wouldn’t budge. I tried to scream but the respirator held my tongue firmly in place. I was unable to move, unable to do anything.

Except watch.

I could still watch as researchers scrambled around me to check vitals and prepare the exoskeleton to finish closing. I could still watch as a giant analog timer appeared on a tv screen above me and began to broadcast a time.

00:00:01:00 Until Deprivation Begins.

I tried again to scream. I tried again to plead to be let out. I found myself unable to feel any part of my body. I strained my eyes to try and get someone’s attention but no one seemed to be looking at me.

00:00:00:30 Until Deprivation Begins.

Had my tear ducts been operating, I would have begun crying.  Without nothing else to do, I began to pray that this was a bad dream. To pray that I was home in bed and not in this chamber.

00:00:00:05 Until Deprivation Begins.

The last thing I saw was the face of Dr. Monason leaning over me. Waving to me. Saying something I couldn’t quite understand. Closing the exoskeleton’s face over my own.

00:00:00:00 Until Deprivation Begins.

And then everything went dark.


If I had been in control of my own breathing, I would have begun hyperventilating immediately. 

I had never felt such a profound sense of darkness as in that moment. Unable to see even my own body, it was as if I had been extinguished from existence. My eyes swam in every direction in search of a single iota of light but found none.

After a moment’s consideration, I realized that I had now been in the machine for some time. I had no reference point for exactly how long. Without outside stimuli of any kind, my only mechanism of telling time was by counting individual seconds in my head.

Yet time ticked on. I found myself alternating between obsessing about my imprisonment and finding myself adrift in my thoughts. 

I began to consider the state of my life. My recent unemployment. My lack of close friends. I felt a wave of depression come over me. Was my life really so meaningless that I could be snuffed out of existence for three days and no one could possibly care?

I pondered the source of my isolation. I looked back to times I could have tried harder at my job. Images of friendships that I had let fall apart out of introversion and stagnation cascaded through my mind. 
And then I came across a thought in my head that, were my body not numbed to the point of immobility, would have made me burst out into laughter.

I felt lonely.

Well, of course, I felt lonely. I was, at that moment, the most alone human being there had ever been. Surely there were researchers only a few feet from my terrestrial body, but my mind had been isolated completely. I was as alone as someone could be.

I let my mind continue to wander. It felt as though I had been in the chamber for hours at this point. Although I had planned to spend this time planning some sort of creative endeavor – the great American novel, perhaps – I found my mind repeatedly coming back to my current predicament. 

Obsessively, I thought about my body and the container that currently housed it. The numbing medicine must have been truly quite something. I couldn’t feel the slightest wisp of breath passing through my nasal cavities or the rumble of my stomach.

It was then that a pair of intertwining thoughts collided in my mind.

A: Could I be dead?

B: No, of course not. That would be ridiculous. 

I knew how I had ended up here – I knew that I had signed up to engage in an experiment that would put me in this exact predicament. But I must admit, I no longer felt very alive. Without my body or the surrounding world as a reference point, it felt as though I had no assurance that I still existed. My thoughts began dueling with one another.

A: Surely I’m not dead. This is exactly what the experiment was supposed to do.

B: If you’re not dead then why can’t you feel anything? Why can’t you feel your breath or saliva or ANYTHING?

A: But I know I’m not dead because I’m thinking right now.

B: What does that mean?

A: You know? I think, therefore I am.

I think, therefore I am. A smarter man could have told you who said that. But I was left with just that proclamation, from an unknown source, as the only assurance that I was alive. As long as I was thinking, I was still alive.

I began to picture myself floating through a void in space. The image was clear in front of my eyes. My body lay flat, my arms stiff, as I rocketed past stars and unfamiliar planets. I watched my body weave past asteroids and through planetary rings. I felt the warmth of the sun on my body and the cold ice of the frozen planets on my skin.

Except I didn’t really feel those things. I had to remind myself of that. I was starting to imagine feelings that weren’t really there. I wasn’t sure how much I should try to avoid these feelings or just embrace them for the duration of the experiment. Just another question to ponder, I suppose.

There came a time when I realized that I had been in sensory deprivation for a long time. Since I had not been counting, it was impossible to know how long. It felt like it had been days already.

Had it been days already?

That was a worrying thought. In a timeless void, three days stretched on like an endless millennium. 

They had assured me that I would only be inside the machine for three days. But how could I know for sure? Once I was inside, I had no way of getting out. They could keep me for as long as they wanted to. Maybe that was their plan all along. 

A: How could they get away with that? 

B: Who knows what all those liability waivers I signed said. I stopped reading them after the third or fourth one. Maybe I agreed to this. 

A: You’re being crazy.

B: I don’t know if I’m being crazy or not. I don’t know how long I’ve been in here.

A: So count!

That was right. I had one way to tell how long I had been inside the machine. Counting.

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

And on and on. I counted to 60. That was a minute. And then I counted another minute. And another and another and another. I just kept going and going. I never lost focus on the task at hand.
Then I hit 1000 minutes. Technically, 1000 minutes was only a little more than 16 and a half hours. Certainly not the three-day period I was supposed to be inside the machine. 

But that was 16 and a half hours on top of all the time I had already spent thinking about my life and dreaming about floating through space. Surely I had spent longer thinking to myself than I had counting.

I tried to guess how long I had been in the machine. It felt like it had been more than three days. I just kept trying to tell myself that I would be let out of the machine soon.

I let my mind drift off again. 

My body was once again floating through space. I watched it drift farther and farther out into an endless void of darkness. The planets and suns shrunk into oblivion until I was truly, deeply alone. 
In the black abyss, a creeping feeling of cold began to set in. Its biting sting spread up my legs and torso to my face. My naked skin turned a pale blue and begun to harden into a crystalline husk. As my body drifted farther into darkness, I watched the surface of my stomach crack and chip. 

Slowly, chunks of my body began to break off and float into the darkness. With each expelled scrap of flesh, a new wave of pain cascaded through my body. I found myself trying to grab onto my frozen body and put it back together, but my arms and legs were so cold that I could not budge. I tried to scream but my tongue had swelled so large that it filled my crumbling, frigid mouth.
All at once, my body exploded into an array of jagged, bloody shards of ice. The pain was indescribable.

Then I was, again, alone in the darkness. Bodiless. Without lungs to expel the panicked breaths I was so desperate to create. I had to keep telling myself – it wasn’t real. I’m still alive. My body is still here, somewhere.

A: But god, didn’t it feel real?

B: But it wasn’t real.

A: Real or not, didn’t it hurt?

B: Yes.

A: Are you scared?

B: Yes.

. . .

A: Wait. Do you hear that?

I listened through ears that were a million miles away. A voice – not mine own – burst into my head. Its bristly accent was familiar.

“Hello! This is Dr. Monason. I’m contacting you again via the small speakers contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. I am proud to announce that you have successfully completed three days within the machine.”

I felt my alarm melt quickly into relief. I tried to smile, to little avail.

“At this juncture, we would like to update you as to the status of our experiment. The data we’re getting from your brain scans is proving incredibly useful. The medical implications are numerous. We have contacted our institutional review board and obtained permission to extend the experiment indefinitely. This is, of course, in accordance with the liability waivers that you’ve signed previously. The machine should be able to keep you alive for a few more weeks until your body becomes unable to support it any further. Do not worry, $5000 will nonetheless be credited into your account. Thank you for your contribution. Your sacrifice will save lives.”

I tried to scream. I tried to flail my arms in protest and push back against the doctor’s words but my screams were silent and my arms no longer part of me.

I felt a deep, echoing hole of dread grow inside me. Yet I would never truly feel anything again.

I would die in this chamber. It would take days. And those days would feel like months. And those months would be torture. 

I again saw myself floating in an immeasurable darkness. There were no stars or planets. There was only my body. Unequivocally alone. Arguably alive, but inevitably dead.

I stopped counting the seconds and just let myself float.

--

My mind wandered again, this time for much longer. I dreamt of my childhood and of a future I would never get to lead. I made an imaginary bucket list and felt remorse for the boxes I had not yet checked. I held conversations in my head between old friends and lovers. 

And sometimes, I didn’t think at all. Sometimes I disappeared from existence altogether.

But then I felt it. I felt something. I couldn’t tell what it was at first. It had been so long since I felt something that I couldn’t tell if I was imagining it or not.

It was my big toe. My big toe on my right foot. Somehow, someway, it still had feeling. Not a lot of feeling – it felt like when you sit on your hand and it becomes almost, but not quite, numb. Like it was being massaged by a set of pins and needles.

I moved the toe around, the little that I could, to try to understand how this feeling had come back.

Then I felt it – a tiny prick. The slightest droplet of pain against my big toe. Something sharp.

An IV needle.

It must have become dislodged somehow. Maybe one of those labcoat-wearing schmucks tripped over it or something. All I knew was that I could feel again. I suddenly felt like I had been born again. Like I had died and risen from the ashes.

This needle must have been one of the needles that was supposed to deliver the numbing chemical into my body. Somehow, it got dislodged and now I had just a little feeling in my toe. Unfortunately, my big toe was hardly the vestige of my body most suited to orchestrate my grand escape. 

But still, I felt immeasurable happiness. Because I had a secret weapon on my side. 

Time. There’s an old adage that goes “If you give a monkey a typewriter and infinite time, he will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare”. Similarly, with a partially numb big toe and infinite time to think, I could craft my grand escape.

My big toe was too weak to push open the exoskeleton. Despite my straining, I was unable to reach any other cords to pull them out. All I could reach was the IV needle that had already been pulled out.
And with that IV needle, I hatched my plan. I scraped my toe across it. It stung, but I knew it would do the trick. I knew that I had forced those stupid scientists’ hands. My efforts had made a cut in my toe-skin. And now I knew I was going to be okay.

They only had two options. Let me bleed out, in which case I would at least be free from this hell, or let me out of the chamber, at least long enough to reattach the IV. Either way, my plan was foolproof. Either way, I was going to be free, at least for a moment.

It only took them a few minutes to notice what I had done.

--

“This is Dr. Monason again, communicating via the tiny speaker in the helmet of the exoskeleton. It seems you have managed to injure yourself inside the exoskeleton. After some discussion, we have elected to pause the experiment and correct the error. Stand by – the exoskeleton will be opening shortly.”

The light that soon flooded my eyes all but blinded me. As the machine opened, I bathed in the sounds of its electronic thunks and whirs and the conversation of the men around me. The quick tug as needles and tube were removed from me felt better than any touch I had ever experienced.

They let me out. I was free.

My body was numb for hours. The medicine prevented me from making any movements, at all. During that time, the scientists left me in the exoskeleton as they went over data and bandaged my big toe. I tried to listen to everything they were saying but found myself unable to concentrate. The bright lights above me burned my eyes, which had grown accustomed to perfect darkness.

As the drugs slowly left my body, a dull ache developed in my joints. After a while, my body was hauled out of the exoskeleton by a team of the labcoats. I felt a dressing gown slip on over my head. I was plopped into a wheelchair. Still unable to move, I listened to the roll of metal wheels as they pushed that chair deeper and deeper into their lab.

--

“Explain again about when you were floating through space. What was the sensation like?”

“Please let me go!”

 “I can’t. You know that. The data we were getting from you is too important. Lives are at stake. And besides that, we can’t risk you going to the police. You will be going back in the machine.”

This conversation had been going on for about an hour in the tiny interrogation room set up somewhere in the research group’s massive underground lab. Although I had regained enough feeling to speak, I still found movement quite difficult. It was clear that as soon as I outlived my usefulness to the lab coats I was going to be placed back inside the machine until my bodily demise. The data that the scientists had gained so far was so useful that they had no problem holding me against my will.

As I sat in that tiny metal room, tied to cold folding chair, clad only in a thin dressing gown, I considered my fate. For $5000 I had sold away the rest of my life. My only respite now was that I could delay going back in the machine for as long as I resisted Dr. Monason’s questioning. But I knew I was just delaying the inevitable.

I stared down at my big toe, now wrapped in a bandage. Somehow it had not dawned on me that, even if I got out of the machine, the scientists were unlikely to let me out of the building alive. Not after they decided to imprison me until I died, anyway.

“What if I don’t answer the questions?”

“The data we intend to receive from those questions is critical and could save lives. But if we cannot illicit it, then the information received from the exoskeleton will be sufficient. If you won’t answer, we will return you to the machine now.”

So it didn’t matter. I was already doomed. I might as well delay for as long as I could.

“Fine. Ask me what you want to ask me.”

I answered hundreds of questions, most of them multiple times. It took hours. The scientists barely listened to my words. There was a recorder placed in the room with me. I’m sure someone would dig through my answers later, but for now the conversation seemed to be mostly for posterity’s sake.

At some point though, I realized something. The drugs had completely left my body. I could, theoretically, move again. For now, I was tied to a chair. But they couldn’t keep me tied up if they wanted me to go back into the machine.

And from that thought, I came up with a plan. I knew I would only have a few seconds. I knew I couldn’t run immediately, or they would catch me. I would have to convince them I was resigned to my fate.
When the questioning concluded, I found myself being hauled back into the chamber containing the exoskeleton. Perhaps assuming that I would flee otherwise, the scientists kept me tied up during transit.

But the ties came off when it was time to put me in the machine. They stripped off my night gown and lifted me inside the machine. I let my body go limp as they did – feigning the same numbness that had, until recently, restricted my movement. As I laid down in the rubber interior of the exoskeleton, Dr. Monason spoke to me through a loudspeaker in the ceiling. 

“I am sorry we have to part again. Your answers will be invaluable for future research. I know it may seem now like we are villains. But the research we’re obtaining is invaluable. It will save lives someday. You are doing a valuable service to the world.”

As his speech ended, his researchers again approached to fill my body with needles and tubes. I was eager to make my escape but I held tight. They would have to believe I was unable to move.

I felt pinpricks in my right arm. I was already being loaded up with the numbing agent. My time was going to be short. As some of the labcoats approached me on my left side to insert another IV, I launched myself upward so I was standing inside the machine. Surprised by my sudden motion, the scientists on my left recoiled. I felt a sharp pain in my right arm as the IVs and tubes held tight against the strain of my sudden motion.

The room exploded into panic. Men rushed at me from all sides. I felt my body moving as if on its own volition. My left arm reached towards my right and ripped a series of cords and needles out of my body. Blood sprayed onto the machine. My right arm fell loosely to my side.

I propelled myself out of the machine and onto the floor, naked as the day I was born. The numbing agent had disabled my right arm, but most of my body was fine. I sprinted towards the door through which I had entered the lab, what now seemed like a millennium ago. I did not dare turn back to see if I was being chased. All I could do was run.

As I pushed the door open, I saw a long hallway that led to a set of alternating staircases. Staircases that I had walked up and down several times while preparing for the experiment. Stairs that I had always assumed I would one day walk up for the last time. 

I pushed my body as hard as I could. I ran with my right arm dangling limp beside me until I reached the stairs. Behind me, the angered yells of men and the thud of their footsteps remained consistent. I knew that if they caught me, it was game over. 

When I reached the stairs, I practically jumped up the entire first flight. As I turned to climb the next flight, I saw that only two men had kept pace with me. Suddenly, I was filled with hope. Perhaps I could outrun them all. Then I would go to the police and get the chance to put this whole operation under the microscope. As soon as I got to the top of that second flight of stairs and through the exit doors, I would be free.

My hopes were dashed as soon as I reached the top of the stairs. At least fifteen men guarded the building’s exit. Clearly my escape had been a contingency for which the facility was prepared. As the men approached behind me and in front of me, I knew there was only one way I could go.

The alternating staircases continued past the first floor. All the way up to the roof.

I kept running. Staircase after staircase. My aching body protesting each step. My dead arm banging against stair railings and walls as I made my way up those stairs. The sounds of angry men filling my ears as I took step after step after step.

Soon I was on the last staircase. A ladder, hanging from the ceiling, led up to a hatch on the roof of the building. This was it. I was going to see the outside world again. I didn’t know where I was going to go once I got up there, but I knew I was free.

I jumped onto the ladder and pulled myself up, about six feet into the air. When I reached the top I pushed on the hatch. It was heavy and barely budged. I strained against the hatch for a moment, then felt a tight grip on my ankle.

One of the men had caught up. He had wrapped his cold hand around my leg and was beginning to yank me off the ladder. I turned slightly and saw it was Dr. Monason. His eyes were red and as large as saucers. It was like looking into the eyes of the devil himself. 

I reacted purely out of instinct. My grip on the ladder tightened and I swung my free foot at the doctor’s face. As my heel collided with his jaw, sending teeth and blood flying in all directions, I couldn’t help but smile at the feeling. It hurt like you wouldn’t believe, but it felt damned good to feel something. 

Dr. Monason relaxed his grip. I pushed upwards again and the hatch gave way. I clambered upwards onto the flat roof of the building. A thin layer of gravel covered the rooftop. The sharp stones poked at my bare feet, but I kept moving. I ran to the edge of the roof and looked out into the city. 

A beautiful horizon of skyscrapers and stars filled my view. I felt the cold breeze against my bare skin. The voices of the men behind me barely registered as I climbed onto the edge of the roof.
I must have been a sight to the people walking by on the sidewalk below. A naked man standing on the edge of a building staring at the horizon as if he had never seen one before. 

“Please come down from there. You don’t have to go back in the machine. We just need you to come down.” 

It was Dr. Monason again. His voice was hard to understand now that he was short a few teeth. I turned away from the horizon to look at him. He was surrounded on all sides by other men in labcoats.

I knew at that moment that I had no real choices left. Could I believe Dr. Monason that he wouldn’t put me back in the machine? Probably not. But I had no chance to escape at this point. There were too many of them for me to get away.

Just as one of the researchers reached out to grab me, I took a step backward.

As my body tumbled down to the earth below, I found myself laughing. It was just like when I was in the machine. My body was floating once again. The cold air numbed my body and, once again, I couldn’t feel a thing. 

Just before I struck the ground, I heard the sound of church bells ringing out. Hallelujah. I figured I must be on my way to heaven.

--

No heaven came. Instead, I found myself in complete darkness. Feeling nothing, seeing nothing, simply ruminating on my previous actions. 

Is this what death is like?

In answer to my question, I heard a familiar voice.

“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you once again via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. You have successfully completed your three days within the exoskeleton.”

Had I not still been pumped full of numbing drugs, I would have wept. 

“We are currently in the process of opening the machine. At that point, we will perform a physical assessment. I’m sure you are anxious to leave. I can assure you we will move as quickly as possible to make that happen. Thank you so much for your assistance with this project. It has been invaluable.”

Three days. I had been in that machine for exactly three days. 

It didn’t click for me until they were pulling me out of the machine. There was no bandage on my big toe, no needle near my foot on which I could have cut myself. 

The facility was nothing but accommodating in the hours after the experiment terminated. They provided me with a comfortable place to rest while the remainder of the drugs left my system. Although they asked questions about my experience, they were not hostile when I refused to speak. The researchers were happy to answer my questions about the experience. Happy to tell me it was all in my head.

In the days following the experiment, Dr. Monason made sure that I was provided with any mental health resources that I requested. He connected me with a therapist that I have been seeing for several weeks. The therapist has prescribed me an antidepressant, which I take twice a day. I have returned to my normal life. My rent is paid. I’m seeing someone new. I got a new job at another book publishing company. 

It’s like all my fantasies have come true.

But no matter how long I talk to the therapist and no matter how many pills I take, I can’t get the machine out of my head. I can’t stop thinking about how those three days seemed to extend indefinitely.

A: But you’re out of the machine. Your three days are up!

B: Yes, but…

A: But what?

B: I was out of the machine once before. 

A: But that wasn’t real.

B: But it felt real. 

A: Does this feel real?

B: . . . I don’t know anymore.

Could three days feel . . . even longer? Could I imagine a therapist, a job, a better life?  I don’t know.

Sometimes I close my eyes and I become too afraid to open them, because I’m worried that when I do, I will see only darkness. I’m scared I will find myself still floating, motionless, amongst those imaginary stars.

nosleep,My wife forgot to delete her browser history. I can’t believe what I found.," 

**4:34 PM: How to stop husband from cheating?**

I had only clicked on the history tab to delete the last thing I’d searched for when I noticed the entry. Hurriedly, I finished zipping up my fly and stared at it in bewilderment.

Amy and I had been almost too careful. We had never so much as looked at one another in my wife’s presence, let alone done anything that could have raised suspicion. There was no way she could have known what was going on, even if she had looked through my phone. With a heavy heart, I’d forced myself to delete any incriminating photos Amy sent me after I was done with them, and we had a strict call-only policy.

Amy was our latest hire and aside from being great at her job, she excelled in garnering male attention. Everyone loved her. She was strikingly beautiful and uninhibited to the point where her energy felt almost carnal, sending all morals and restraints out the window. I tried to ignore her at first, even finding excuses to go home early, but eventually, her charming giggle got the better of me too.

**4:37 PM: How much does divorce cost?**

Droplets of sweat sprang out on my forehead. *What?* Was my wife planning to divorce me? But *why?* There was no way she knew about Amy and me. Was there someone else? Was she planning to accuse me of infidelity, all while going at it with some lover boy she’d met at her yoga class?

**4:39 PM: Why do humans feel emotions?**

I pursed my lips. If by some miracle my wife did know about the affair, I couldn’t imagine the way she must have been feeling. I woke up late this morning and found a note on the kitchen table, saying that she didn’t want to wake me and that she was out doing her Saturday errands. I almost felt compelled to call her and – oh…

I flinched as a large drop of blood landed on the keyboard. *What the hell?* My first instinct was to look up at the ceiling. Nothing. A strong metallic smell made me come to my senses. I brushed my hand against my face. A bright red smudge sat on my palm. I stared at it, alarmed. I’d never gotten nosebleeds before, aside from the time I got hit in the face with a football in high school. My head raised, I scrambled to my feet and made a dash for the bathroom, my hands cupping my throbbing nose.

Once I had managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned myself up, I returned to the computer.

**4:44 PM: Which part of the brain is responsible for love?**

This was… an oddly specific search. I couldn’t recall my wife ever being interested in science or biology. I checked the account logged into the browser, just in case. Perhaps this was someone else’s history altogether? Or maybe we’d been hacked?

No. Seemed like everything was in order. My wife’s smiling face stared back at me from the login window. What was she doing searching for brain parts anyway?

**4:49 PM: What is excerebration?**

What? What was…*excerebration?* Some kind of fancy divorce? I’d never heard of the term in my life. I didn’t even hesitate before clicking it, eager to find out what my wife was planning for us.

I wish I hadn’t.

As the results came up on the monitor, my stomach lurched and my gag reflex kicked in. The images were graphic enough for my hand to automatically gravitate towards the ‘return’ button, but a short paragraph in bold caught my eye.

***‘An ancient procedure involving chiseling through the bone of the nose, in order to scoop out the brain matter.’***

My heart hammering in my chest, I clicked the ‘back’ button and scanned the rest of the entries.

**5:01 PM: Can a person live without the hypothalamus?**

**5:05 PM: Location of the hypothalamus**

**5:11 PM: How much Temazepam is safe?**

My skin crawled as I read, but I couldn’t look away. I was so immersed that I didn’t even hear the front door bang.

“Honey? I’m home!”

I stared at the wall, too shocked to reply. What was I meant to say? How was I supposed to ask her about all this?

“Hello?” she called again, her heels clacking towards me.

“Uh, hey!” I choked, throwing the box of tissues into the drawer, “How was…”

“Oh, good,” she smiled as she appeared in the doorway, “How are you? You had quite a lot to drink last night!”

“I-uh…” I stammered, “I did?”

She studied me, as though she wasn’t sure whether I was joking or not.

“The… I… W-what’s all this?” I asked, gesturing to the computer screen.

She joined me at the desk, frowning at the clammy wood surface, “What?”

I pointed at the browsing history, my index finger shaking visibly in the air.

“Oh,” she flushed, two pink spots appearing on her cheeks, “Well, you did say we could try it, so… I had to do a little research, y’know?”

“What? I said we could try…what?”

“Oh,” she waved her hand dismissively, “The exce-something. You probably know better.”

My blood ran cold. *The excerebration.*

“Karen…what did you do?”

But before she could say anything, a splash of blood landed on the carpet. And then another one. And another. Karen watched me, her skin growing pale, “W-what…”

Suddenly, a small fleshy lump escaped my nostril and rolled down the front of my shirt. We both stared at it in shocked silence. Then, my wife screamed, turning on her heel to flee the room, but I caught up to her, pinning her against the wall.

“Tell me what the fuck you did!”

She tried to fight me, writhing under my grip, but I held on tight. Blood was streaming into my mouth and down my chin, staining both of our clothes.

“H-how can you not remember?” she screeched, trying to elbow me in the ribs, “Don’t you remember what you did?”

I stared at her panic-stricken face, trying my best to recall any memories from the previous night, “No…what did I do?”

“You…you came home after work and told me you were leaving me for Amy,” she sobbed, “You said you didn’t want to love her, but you did!”

I stood there quietly, mulling it over, as more pulp splashed onto my stomach.

“Ew! We need to call you an ambulance!” Karen shrieked, trying to pull away, “What the fuck is that?”

“Then what happened?” I demanded, my heart practically leaping out of my chest, “Tell me what you did.”

“What the fuck, John?” she screamed, “We got drunk, okay? We got really wasted! And then you said you knew of a way to fix this! To fix us! You said there’s something called hypothalamus in your brain, and if removed it would stop you from loving Amy…”

I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. What the hell was she saying? Had she actually attempted to remove a part of my brain? And…

“Wait…” I whispered, “Who’s Amy?”

Her expression made me feel foolish for not remembering. I knew that name. *Amy.* It sounded so familiar, and yet I couldn’t for the life of me put my finger on it.

“What…what the fuck do you mean?” she sounded bewildered, “Amy! The girl you were cheating on me with for six months?”

“I… I don’t,” I mouthed, releasing my wife and crumpling to the floor, “I don’t remember.”

Karen stared at me, her white blouse resembling a massacre, her mouth pressed into a thin line.

“What…what’s happening to me?” I whispered.

She was silent for a moment, but I could see her eyes brimming with tears, “Honey….What if… What if I… accidentally hit your hippocampus instead?”

*What?* That told me nothing.

“For fuck’s sake, Karen, I’m not a *fucking* encyclopedia! Enlighten me! What the hell is a hippocampus?”

Nothing could have prepared me for what she said next.

“Honey,” she sobbed, “You’re…a doctor. It’s the memory part of your brain.”",Entertainment

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cj2g4k/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app


I was in complete shock. Looking at it. At her.

Prudence had a facial expression filled with guilt and now I knew the truth I could see it. The creature was exactly how Ian had described, except with wavy ginger hair and a sadness in its beady eyes. 

This abomination was Lyla. This was how Prudence had bought her back, and this was the only way I would ever see Jamie again, a risk I wasn’t going to take. After days of disbelief the reality finally hit me like a ton of bricks. Jamie was dead and he wasn’t coming back.

“Why did you do this?” I asked, my voice shaking with horror.

Prudence scowled at me, trying to mask her shame.

“I didn’t want this. If you think this was my aim then you’re sicker than I am. I just wanted my granddaughter back. 

When she died a part of me died. My son blamed me, his wife blamed me and although he never said it, I could see in Bernie’s eyes that he did too. 

I’d pushed for her to stay, I wanted to spend more time with her. I got cocky about my ability to cope with the strange occurrences in the flats. I know what you must be thinking. But I swear I didn’t know about the sleepwalking until it was too late.

We had moved into the flat not long after my son left home to move in with his girlfriend. He’s the youngest of three and was the last to fly the nest, so we downsized for the two of us. He never knew what we were facing in that flat, or the dangers that he sent his little girl into. 

When it happened it was a few years after the fire and the troubles with the creatures. We’d struck the deal with the things in the lift and the neighbours of the burned flats had become a fixture just like the other quirks. I really thought she would be safe.”

Prudence paused to gaze longingly at the mutated little girl in the cage, the creature just twitched. In return it barred its 4 rows of teeth and made a gentle hiss.

“But how did you do this!?” I stopped her with more urgency this time, looking at rat-Lyla in disbelief. I had to get answers out of her fast. I didn’t want to spend anymore time than was absolutely necessary in this shed. 

“The gardener helped me.” She answered, her voice trembling. 

“Who the fuck is the gardener?” I grew more impatient with every new confusion she threw at me. The last thing I needed was something new and potentially malevolent in the mix. 

“I didn’t mention him in my note because he’s been gone for over 20 years, he’ll be of no concern to you so don’t worry. His damage is in the past now...

Around the time Lyla went missing the council granted planning permission for the tower block next door. But before that was built the land it sits on acted as a communal garden for ours and the neighbouring tower block on the other side. It had a regular gardener named Derek who you would often see tending the flowerbeds out front. 

Derek was one of the first people I met when I moved in.

Like I said, I had to work it all out myself and the first time the window cleaner came to the balcony I naturally reached to let him in and offer a cup of tea.

As my hand applied pressure to the handle to open the balcony door, there was a knock at the front door. I made a gesture to the cleaner to indicate that I would only be a minute and answered. 

There was Derek. He stopped me and told me not to let the man in, that I would be making a huge mistake.

I thought he sounded crazy, and I told him so, after a while of arguing I got up to reboil the kettle and let the man in and Derek grabbed my hands and shouted at me to look at the man outside.

When I turned to look, there was no man outside, but a monster. He was tall and impossibly thin, flesh and bones but somehow thinner than bones with greying skin stretched over them. He had eyes that seemed to be so deep set they went on forever, like the blackest cave you can imagine. Saliva dripped from his mouth and landed on my balcony floor, some sliding down the glass panel of the door. 

I opened my mouth to scream, but as I did, Derek let go of my hands and the monster was gone. In its place was that smug, friendly man, begging for a drink while he cleans the windows. 

It took me a minute to process it, but I know what I’d seen. That was the real window cleaner. I never intentionally opened or tried to open the door for him again. 

That day Derek didn’t stay long. He didn’t tell me what the window cleaner is, or why he visits every few days. He didn’t explain anything about the weird things that go on. As much as Derek was a part of the strange happenings he was like one that had been carved from light.

He said that he’d always be around when I needed him, that it was his job to look after the residents just like the flowerbeds. 

Over the years he appeared a few times. He was instrumental in striking a deal with the creatures. When the neighbours died in the fire he created a special display for them in the garden, and made sure that nothing planted was poisonous to the cats as soon as they arrived. He also stopped an imposter from killing Bernie at our front door.

He seemed like such a good thing for the residents. Always there to help. Offer some gentle advice or a creative solution. Someone to be trusted.

He changed when they granted planning permission for the other block though. He knew his garden would be dug up to lay foundations and his uses redundant. He became grumpy and bitter over time but no one payed enough attention to notice. Especially not when my tragedy struck.

When Lyla died I was devastated. Derek appeared to me as I sat on a bench in the garden crying. He offered to help me, to use the garden to get her back. I snapped at him. I told him it was his fault and that he should have been there when it happened to stop them. 

He worked so hard on the agreement with the creatures, he spent a lot of time with them. Lyla broke the rule and he had to allow them to do what had been agreed, he said. He couldn’t have stopped them. But he wanted to help make things right. 

I understood why he hadn’t intervened. But I couldn’t accept it, I lashed out at him. I’m embarrassed to say I actually slapped the poor man along with stamping on his freshly planted flowerbed. I was angry and grieving. 

I quickly burned myself out and collapsed into a blubbering heap on the floor. Derek attempted to comfort me but his mind was on his garden.

He said he was sorry for my loss but I shouldn’t have attacked the flowerbed. That he’d always been nice to me and I should be kinder in return.

I snapped and told him that it didn’t matter because it was all about to be bulldozed in the next few days anyway.

I should have taken more note of the way he twitched as I said that. He snapped.

He said that he knew I was angry. But there was no need to take it out on him, if I was that desperate to get Lyla back he knew a way. But it was dangerous. 

I begged. Anything I said. I would do anything. 

He told me it was simple and that all I had to do was enter the lift and offer the creatures some food whilst repeating the phrase *revertetur mortuis* during their frenzied hours. 

He said that there was no guarantee they wouldn’t be crunching on my bones before I even got the first word out but that if I succeeded I would have Lyla back. 

Of course, it was successful. There wasn’t a creature in sight as I performed the ritual as instructed. 

I thought nothing happened at first. She didn’t appear straight away, but a few days later I found her running round inside my house, she’d taken a chunk out of Damon’s ear with her teeth. I tried to kill her at first, but just as I was about to finalise it I saw in her eyes who she was. 

I tried to look for Derek but by that point the workmen had started. Nothing was left of his garden, and nothing was left of Derek. No one’s seen him since. You see, Kat, nothing in that building is totally harmless. You have to be on your guard at all times.

I’ve kept her like this ever since. You may think I’m crazy but I couldn’t kill my own granddaughter. I’m not a monster.”

Prue sighed and ushered me back out of the shed, she locked the door behind us, closing the padlock on her most hideous secret. 

I was exhausted. It was a lot of information to take in and as a result of the information I’d received, real grief for my boyfriend was finally settling in. Every hope I had was dashed. I know many of you tried to tell me in the comments that he was gone but I wanted you to be wrong so bad. 

I couldn’t bear to look at Prudence Hemmings for another moment. I made my excuses and left, morosely riding the bus back to the tower block I had once been so excited to live in. 

It was mid afternoon by time I got home. The choice between the stairs and lift didn’t strike much enthusiasm into me but I opted for the stairs, and after what I’m sure ended up being 11 flights, I made it the 6 flights up the stairs to my flat. 

I laid on our mattress on the floor and sobbed for Jamie. I sobbed so hard my throat went dry and hurt and my stomach cramped with each gasping breath. I sobbed myself to sleep. My body and mind must have given up fighting the need to rest and shut down.

When I woke up it was late, about 10pm. I wrote as much of my update as I could for you guys, hit post and just sat at the dining table with my head in my hands. 

My whole life had fallen to shit and I knew it. 

I thought about so many things, questioned why they were happening to me. I searched social media for updates on Georgia but there were none. Jamie wasn’t super close with his family but I knew it wasn’t long before they’d start to worry. Everything I considered just snowballed in my mind.

The loneliness in dealing with this situation was killing me. 

I decided to do something I usually wouldn’t. I went downstairs and I knocked on the door of flat 26. 

Terri answered. Her perfectly bobbed hair was a little unkempt and out of place, she had huge bags under her eyes and I could smell wine on her breath. 

“Are you ok Kat?” She looked concerned. I found it ironic that she looked so disheveled I had forgotten it was me who came for help.

“I’m not... I’m sorry... I know I don’t know you ..I ... just...” I could barely speak.

“Don’t worry. Prue called me. She told me everything. I’m sorry about your boyfriend, it’s a shame I never got to meet him.” Terri stared back at me with the same expression a mother would, warm and understanding. “Would you like a cup of tea, maybe something stronger?”

“I’d love a coffee please.” I answered meekly, making way way into the living room, her sofa was comfy, it reminded me of being back home at my parents before any of this started. 

Terri trotted out to the kitchen, stumbling slightly. I could see the kitchen counter from the sofa, and the empty bottle of wine that accounted for her stumbling. 

As she boiled the kettle there was a huge crash from somewhere inside the flat. I jumped, feeling startled. Terri coughed in a meagre attempt to conceal the noise.

“Excuse me for just a moment please.” She muttered apprehensively as she walked out of the living area and into the hallway containing the bedrooms. 

I heard another crash, giggling and some inaudible shouting. After a while things went quiet and Terri came back into the living room. 

“Sorry about that, kids you know.” She announced, brushing off the noises. I’d almost forgotten about Eddie and Ellie. It was late already and by the resigned expression on Terri’s face indicated that this was how all her nights began. 

I nodded. I couldn’t muster up much more of a response. I think she could see that I just needed to sit there. She got up to finish making and then set the cup of tea in front of me with 2 digestive biscuits. I hadn’t eaten properly in days and I really needed the sugar. 

It turned out me and Terri get along really well. We have similar taste in movies, music and food despite the age gap. We spoke for about an hour about random, normal stuff. It was nice to get a break from the madness. I got used to the crashing around from the twins. I even laughed a few times. I’d forgotten what that felt like these past few days.

The break didn’t last long. The next noise that we heard was louder than the first. It was quickly followed by two small children, running into the living room diving into their mothers arms. 

I was taken aback for a moment. Eddie and Ellie were dressed in pyjamas, and were still the cute children that I had met in the hallway, but something was different. Their brown puppy dog eyes had become deep voids, like what I’d imagined when Prue described the window cleaners true form. And at the ends of their fingers were long sharp claws protruding from where nails should be. 

I didn’t have time to recoil in terror at their new looks, Terri clutched them and asked what was wrong. They wailed and buried the voids where their eyes should be into their mothers shoulders. Despite their terrifying exterior, these were two very scared little kids. 

It had been a very long day and I thought my nightmare was over but it was only just beginning. Ellie mumbled into Terri’s shoulder, in that high pitched voice kids do when they’re scared.

“Mummy, were sorry, we didn’t mean to let them in. We were just teasing...”

“Shhh they’re coming!” Hissed Eddie, in the same distressed high pitched tone. 

“Who’s... what have you done?” Terri asked, colour drained from her face.

The kids didn’t get a chance to reply. Terri’s face turned paler than I thought possible. I looked up and standing in the living room doorway were about 10 people, all incredibly average looking. 

They were almost expressionless, they didn’t look angry or pleased to see us. They were dressed in non descriptive clothes. I imagined trying to describe them to one of those artists that draws pictures for the police and I genuinely don’t think even one of them had a distinguishing feature. 

That’s why it took me a while to spot her in the crowd, even though she had been glaring at me the entire time. 

Natalia.

nosleep,My job is watching a woman trapped in a room. Part Two.,"
[Part One]( https://redd.it/brco33)

**** 

I thought about the camera above me and took my hand away from my face.  I rolled back to the desk and sat there, trying to stop from shaking, trying to make myself take a breath.  Think about it slow.  The first thing was, should I hit a button?

The red button was for an emergency.  If she *was* a prisoner or something, and she was trying to escape, they might think that was an emergency.  But no one had been hurt that I knew of.  And I think Mr. Solomon meant save that for something that was like a police or ambulance emergency, not something like this.  But what about the green button?

This was definitely something “noteworthy”.  Not only that she was asking for help, but that she was asking *me* for help.  

I made myself stop for a moment.  I couldn’t know for sure she was asking me.  I had gone to school with several boys named Thomas.  It was a common name.  But the chances of her painting that name when I was working here?  I didn’t want to be silly, but I wasn’t trying to be too…what’s that word.  Mom used to say it when she read her angel books.  Skeptics.  I didn’t want to be a skeptic either.  I had to believe it was probably meant for me.  And that was something they would want to know.

But should I hit the green button?  My hands were drifting toward the metal box on the desk, but I hesitated.  I didn’t like breaking rules, and I was scared of what would happen if I broke these.  If they really were holding her prisoner, then they were probably very bad people.  But I didn’t know that.  Maybe they were good and *she* was bad.  But I just…

I looked back at the monitor for the first time since reading the words.  Rachel was already moving the paintings back off the sofa, as though she knew the message had been received.  A canvas in each hand, she glanced up at the camera as she moved across the room, and it felt like she was looking right at me.  My chest tightened as my hands moved away from the buttons.  

No.  I didn’t think she was bad.  I had watched her for years.  I felt like I knew her, would know if she was bad.  Strange as it seemed, in a way she was my friend.  And I was going to try and help her.

**** 

I spent the rest of my shift trying to act normal and think of what to do.  I knew whoever else was watching might have noticed the paintings or seen how I acted, but I couldn’t worry about that.  I would try to play it cool and try to think how I could help her.

The only people I had actually met connected to this job were a couple of people when I filled out the papers and then Mr. Solomon when he showed me the model room and told me the job.  I had no way of contacting any of them except through the buttons.  My checks were deposited electronically and I had never run into anyone else who worked at the surveillance room.

That thought made me stop a second.  I had always thought it was weird that I never ran into someone when I was coming or going—the person I was taking over for or the person who was taking over for me.  I had always figured there must be other people, other surveillance rooms even, and they just scheduled us so we didn’t run into each other.  And I still thought there were others.

Part of why I thought that was because it seemed like I wasn’t the only person who used my surveillance room.  The water cooler, the toilet paper, the soap, they all seemed go down faster than I think I was using it by myself.  If that was true, maybe I could figure out who they were, and maybe they would be safer to talk to than whoever it was that I worked for.

I got off work at eight that night, and instead of grabbing some food and going home, I drove my car around the block and then parked down the street from the building where I worked.  Nothing had changed while I drove around for a minute—no new cars had parked or anything—and if I was right, they didn’t send anyone to replace me until they were sure I was gone anyhow.  

So I sat and waited.

I was tired and the street was pretty empty and boring, but I was too excited and scared to fall sleep.  Every time a car passed or someone walked down the sidewalk, I tensed.  I kept imagining a SUV or van pulling up behind me.  Men getting out and pulling me from my car, taking me somewhere like where they had Rachel to kill or torture me.  Half a dozen times I almost cranked up and drove away, but every time I would think of her alone in that room.  She had no one but me to help her, and I had to try.

Two hours later, a fat balding man parked and started heading for the building.  As soon as I saw he was able to unlock the door and enter, I opened my car door to go talk to him.  Then I stopped.  I needed to be smart.  I didn’t know where they were, but I was sure there were hidden cameras in the locker room and outside the building.  If I go running in there and confront that guy, they’ll know for sure that I’m up to something.

Sighing with frustration, I shut the door back and waited until his shift was over.  I considered tailing him like in the movies, but I was scared I would just lose him or he would call someone for help.  So I waited until he was walking back to his car after a six hour shift, hopefully far enough away that the cameras wouldn’t see.  And then I met the man I came to know as Charles Jefferies.

**** 

“Hey…Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute?”   His back was to me and he just waved his hand absently without looking up.

“Sorry, I don’t have any money.  Have a good…”  He froze as he glanced back at me while talking.  “Oh God.  No.  No.  You need to get out of here, kid.  We aren’t allowed to talk.”  I could tell he was scared, but I couldn’t risk letting him go yet, not after all this.  I stepped up and pushed the door back shut as he was trying to get into his car.

“So you know who I am?”  I tried to not sound mean, but I could hear how mad I was in my voice.

He yanked at the door again, but I was still holding it, and I was stronger than he was.  After a second, weaker tug, he turned around, his face strained and tired-looking.  “Yeah, I know who you are.  You work here just like me.  And I’m telling you, we aren’t supposed to be talking.  We aren’t supposed to meet, ever.”

I frowned.  “Mr. Solomon never told me that.  He never said it was one of the rules.”

The man shook his head.  “Mr. Solomon.  Yeah.  Well there are plenty of rules they don’t tell you.  I bet they didn’t tell you what you were going to be watching before you started, did they?”  When I just lowered my eyes, he went on.  “Yeah, me either.  I’ve been at this job for ten years.  I’ve seen other people come and go, usually because they broke one those rules they never mentioned.  The only reason I’m still here is because I keep my head down and my mouth shut.”  He wagged a finger at me.  “You should do the same, if it’s not already too late.”

I felt my stomach curling into a cold knot.  “Too late?”

The man rubbed his face.  “Kid, do you think they don’t know we’re talking?  Do you think anything happens that they don’t know about?”  He looked back toward the building, a look of sadness and fear in his eyes.  “Hell, for all I know, you’ve already killed us both.”  Shaking his head, he pushed me back and started opening the door.  “Either way, I’m done risking it.  You need to stop asking questions and just do your job.  It’s a lot healthier.”

With that, he got into his car and shut the door.  I didn’t try to stop him this time.  Even though I had already been worried about what he was telling me, hearing it confirmed was paralyzing.  What exactly was my plan?  He probably didn’t know any more than I did, and even if he did, what could I do with anything he told me?

I walked back to my car with a heavy heart.  I was still afraid, but more than that, I was sad and ashamed.  I wanted to help Rachel, but I wasn’t sure how.  I wasn’t giving up, but as I drove back to my apartment, I couldn’t think of what I should do next.  This wasn’t a movie.  I wasn’t a hero.  And the only ideas I had left were to either go to the police, who might be controlled by whoever I worked for, or try to get proof of her being held prisoner myself.

As I parked my car and walked into my apartment building, I made a decision.  Unless I thought of something better overnight, I would do both ideas.  Tomorrow I would break the rule about carrying anything in.  I’d use my phone to record a video of the surveillance room, of Rachel and how she was trapped somewhere, and of me telling everything else I knew.  And I would email it to every newspaper, website, and internet channel I could think of.  I’d then go to the police and give them a copy too if I could make it that long without getting caught.  Maybe if I did all that, even if they got me, someone would help Rachel.

I was filled with worry and dread at the idea of being hurt or killed.  A part of me kept saying I should just do as I was told and hope that it all went away.  But I couldn’t live with myself if I did that.  Even if I messed up, I felt like I had to try.  I was so preoccupied that I didn’t hear the person coming up behind me as I unlocked my apartment door.

“Thomas?”

I turned around and felt my legs weaken as I stumbled back against my door.  I had to be dreaming or crazy.  I grabbed the door knob for support as I looked at the woman in front of me.  It couldn’t be her, but somehow it was.

nosleep,The Grim Reaper's scythe isn't to harvest you. It's to protect you from something on your journey.,"There is no fear as potent as the fear of the unknown. No monstrous visage discovered yet has been as terrifying as the infinite potential for horror which exists before the mask is removed. 

That is why we humans, in our naive misunderstanding of the universal order, are gripped by the mortal fear of death. We think it the final frontier - the greatest imaginable unknown from whose penumbral shores no traveler may return. And so we cling desperately onto even the most dreary and anguished lives, suffering any known evil over our release into the beyond. 

But death is not to be feared, because death is very well understood. We have witnessed it, caused it, measured and recorded it to the last dying spasm of neuronal flickering. Even as I lay dying, it seemed silly to me that I should be afraid of the emptiness which reason promised to expect. 

While I was alive I wouldn't experience death, so there was no reason to be afraid now. When I was dead, I wouldn't be capable of experiencing anything, so fear still had no cause. That thought brought me great comfort as I felt the last erratic struggle from my heart against the inevitable conclusion I approached. It wasn't until I was finally drifting off to sleep that a final intrusive doubt bubbled in my brain:

*What if it isn't death which is to be feared? What if it is what lies beyond?*

And so troubled did I slip beyond mortal understanding, stepping into a world as far forsaken by reason as I was now from life. I was still in the hospital room, but the bustle of nurses and the beeping machines lost their opacity as though I was mired in swiftly descending dusk. It seemed as though every sound was an echo of what it once was; every sight a reflection. With each passing moment, the world was becoming less real...

But all that sight and sound - all that being - it wasn't simply disappearing. It was *transforming* into a figure beside me. The less real my room became, the more real the figure was, until presently it existed in such sharp actuality that nothing beside it seemed real at all. 

His cloak was black. Not the *color* black, but its essence. It was as though seeing a tiger after a lifetime of looking at a child's crude drawing and thinking that's all a tiger was. Reality flowed around his scythe like a brush through water colors, and I could see each elementary particle and time itself sunder across its blade. 

Surely this, I thought. This is why we were taught without words to fear death. I clutched at my hospital blanket to cower from the intensity of the Reaper's presence, but the once soft cotton now flowed like translucent mist through my hands. I knew in that moment that nothing could hide me from the specter's grasp, for he was the only real thing in this world. 

**You're late.**

They weren't words. My head ached from the strain of this knowledge as my lateness was burned into my awareness, imparted like an inescapable law of physics as unequivocal as gravity. 

**We don't have time for the usual speech. Hurry now.**

I felt myself swept up around him like dirt in a hurricane. Before I knew what was happening, we were outside the hospital, moving at such a frenzied pace that the world around me blurred into a dizzying tunnel of flashing light. 

**If you're lucky, IT will have gotten bored of waiting for you.**

I had too many questions, all fighting for attention in the forefront of my brain without any making their way out. 

**You're quiet. I admire that. Usually people ask too much.**

""What's the point?"" I asked. My voice felt flat and dead compared to his overwhelming substance. ""How can I try to comprehend something so beyond mortal knowledge?""

**You can't. But it's still human nature to ask.**

We weren't slowing. If anything, our pace was increasing. I wasn't running, or flying, or anything of that nature. It was more like the rest of the world was moving around us while we stood still. A vague darkness and a heavy damp smell made me guess that we'd gone underground, but I couldn't say for sure. 

""One question then,"" I asked. ""What else is here besides you?"" 

**And that is why questions are pointless. Death is not a place, or a person. It's all there is.**

Troubling thought, but made more so by the growing howl which began reverberating the rocks around me. We still seemed to be descending into the Earth, and the air was growing warmer and denser now. The sound continued to mount as though the world itself was suffering. 

""Then what is IT?""

**What I'm here to protect you from.**

The rocks split from a flash of his scythe, and the ground opened further into a sprawling cavern dominated by a subterranean lake. 

""But I thought you said you were all there is.""

**No, I said Death was all there is.**

We weren't moving any longer. Light glinted off the scythe from some unseen source and streamed into the lake like a tributary. Once inside, the light didn't reflect or dissipate, but swirled and danced like luminescent oil. 

""I thought you were Death.""

**Death is not a person.**

The light was taking a life of its own inside the water. The still surface began to churn with the enigmatic energy. It took my scattered mind a long while to realize that *I* was the energy flowing into the lake. I still felt tangled up with the figure, but we now existed as a beam of light boiling into the water. 

I knew I wouldn't understand, but that didn't stop me from feeling frustrated. If Death is all there is, then what is IT? What was waiting for me? The water pressed in around me and I couldn't speak, although I could still draw breath somehow. 

**IT is here.**

Something was in the water around me. Hands grabbed me by the legs and began dragging me downward. I was amazed to even discover I had limbs again. They felt so alien to me that it was almost as though this body was not my own. Light flashed from the scythe - then again. The hands let go, and the howling rose once more. The Reaper was fighting something, although I couldn't make any sense of the battle except for the madness of thrashing water.

The howling Earth reached its crescendo, and the *screams* made the water around me convulse and contract like living fluid. Had the Reaper cut it? Was I safe? I began to explore my new body in the water, but just when I thought I was beginning to gain control the hands clutched me once more. I lurched downward, struggling in vain against their implacable grip. 

""What is here?"" I tried to shout against the suffocating liquid. ""What is happening?"" 

But I couldn't sense the Reaper's presence any longer. The heat was unbearable, but the cold depths the hands were dragging me toward was even worse. I became aware of a blinding light at the bottom of the lake, and though I struggled, the hands dragged me inexorably onward. 

**I'm sorry. I couldn't fight IT off.** It seemed to be coming from so far away now. **We will try again next time.** 

The pressure - the heat - the noise - the hands dragging me into the blinding light. I closed my eyes and screamed. I was free from the water now, but I just kept screaming. I couldn't bear to look at IT - whatever had stolen me. Whatever was Death but wasn't - whatever even the Reaper could not defeat. 

Then words spoke. Real, human words from a real human mouth. My senses were so distraught that I couldn't make sense of them, but I'm guessing they were something like: 

""Congratulations! He's a healthy baby boy."" 

Most people can't remember the day they die, or the day they were born. I happen to remember both, and I know that [they are the same](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). ",Entertainment
nosleep,The Monster Under your Bed isn't Always there to Scare You,"I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed.

“Hey,” the voice called out.

I told myself I was just imagining it. 

“Hey kid,” the voice repeated.

I drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“I’m the monster underneath your bed,” the voice replied.

“You mean you’re real?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?” the monster said. “Of course I’m real.”

“Do you have a name?” I asked.

“Of course I have a name.”

“Oh... well what is it?”

“Frank.”

“Frank?”

“Yeah,” the monster said. “Is there something wrong with that?”

“No. I mean, I don’t know,” I said. “It’s just not very monster-ly.”

“Well my parents didn’t want me to be a monster.”

“Really? What did they want you to be?”

“A dentist.”

“That’s funny,” I said. I could feel myself beginning to smile.

“What do your parents want you to be?” it asked.

“I don’t know.... Hey Frank?”

“Yeah?”

“Aren’t you gonna... like... scare me or something?”

“What? Why would I do that?”

“Well, you’re a monster, aren’t you?”

“Well, yeah, of course I am, but that doesn’t mean that I scare little kids.”

“But I thought that was your job.”

“It is my job to scare people,” he replied. “But only bad people.”

“Am I a bad person?” I asked.

“No,” he said, “but you’re not the one I’m here to scare.”

“Who are you here to scare?” I asked.

“The man inside your closet.” 

The skin on my arms goosefleshed up. I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn’t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.

The warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.

I hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.

My parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn’t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they’d jumped out the window. 

My parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary’s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. 

From what I heard Gary’s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. 

I never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.

He tells the doctors that he’s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.

nosleep,My mom kept me safe with a text code. She just used it.,"

My mom was my whole world when I was growing up. When I was seven my father left my mom and me after she found him having an open affair with a coworker. He beat her up for having the audacity to leave him, but she got the house and scrubbed him from our lives. She decided she would focus on herself and taking care of other women so she worked for lots of women's shelters and such. She eventually became a court counselor and social worker for abused women and children, and she really helped people get out of abusive situations. She understood the world isn't always kind to women. 


Being the amazing woman she was, she knew growing up as a girl is already hard, so we had safety codes and phrases built in to keep me safe. She also had a special rule that if I was in trouble, I could call her or text her in our special way and she would come get me, no questions asked, and no consequences. That way if I was in trouble, I could call her without fear of her reaction or punishment. She told me she understood being a teen means making choices of your own, and sometimes those are really stupid choices, but they shouldn't cost me my innocence. She cared first and foremost for my safety. 


When I was eleven I went on my first sleepover and I just wasn't comfortable. I wanted to go home but I didn't want my friend's feelings to get hurt. Our code was two punctuations. If I used two of any punctuation at the end, that meant I needed help or wanted to leave, but didn't want a person near me to know. 


Me: Hey mom!!

Mom: Hey, your uncle just called and I might need to come get you, can you tell your friend you have to leave? 

Me: Do I have to??

Mom: Yes, please pack up. 


That way I saved face and could blame my mom. I did use it from time to time but it was rare. I knew I always had that safety net growing up, though I was pretty safe in the area we lived in. It was a small town on the outskirts of a college town, and I was advanced for my age so most of my friends were the kids my mom was always around with the shelters, and they were pretty laid back kids for the most part. I also hung around the shelters and the women would talk to me like I was grown, which was nice considering I was closer in age to half of them than my mom was. I didn't hang out with any rebellious kids and never really did anything stupid enough to be noted until college. 


When I started college two years early, I realized really quickly how safe my little town was. I was graduating early and only sixteen, but the college I went to was the one right next to our town, and I could live at home and drive to campus and such. I had gotten drunk a small handful of times but my friends and I were always safe and didn't drive. My first frat party was...a lot. I'd never seen so many drunk people doing such crazy stuff. It was exhilarating but also really overwhelming. I ended up finding a quiet corner with a few people chilling. I struck up a conversation with a cute guy and he offered to get me a drink. I know, dumb niave girl, I didn't think twice and drank the drink. About ten minutes later I started feeling really strange and went to the bathroom. I had my phone in my hand, while I heard mister polite knocking on the door, but I could barely see my screen as I texted my mom. 


Me: I'm at *street redacted* can I stay a little past curfew??

Mom: Absolutely not, I'm coming to pick you up RIGHT NOW young lady! 

Me: !!


It was all I could see to press in my rapidly blurring state before the guy managed to get the door open and ""help"" me out of the bathroom. He checked my phone, saw the messages to my mom and with a snide huff, called me a worthless baby, kicked me in the thigh and left me sitting in the hallway alone. I know for a fact my mom got me out of a horrible situation that night. Part of our code was if we included an address, it was an emergency. An address meant DANGER. She had burned that into my memory, know the address, write it down, copy it as a memo on your phone, anything. So I memorized addresses before I went to parties, and she saved me that night. 


She didn't get mad I was drinking or somewhere she had warned me against going, she was just so worried about me and wanted me to be ok. That night she took me to the hospital and they put me on saline and something else to help flush the drug from my system. I just remember mom sitting by my bed looking relieved but still worried. I didn't realize how dangerous that situation could have gotten, but she did. Beyond that I don't remember ever needing the code. She talked to me and told me the hard truths of being a young woman in today's world after I sobered up, and I've been very careful ever since. 


Last month my mom passed away of a fatal heart attack. She had always had a weak heart and she was saving up money to get a pacemaker but it just didn't happen fast enough. I was completely devastated. I thought of my mom as a permanent fixture in my life, the rock that was always keeping me grounded and safe. She was immortal in my eyes and I didn't know what I was going to do, how I was going to move on with my life without my confidant, my protector. I just didn't know what to do. When I opened her door and she wasn't there I just cried. Knowing she wouldn't ever be there again was just so horrible. I texted her phone and it rang on the table. I looked at it and wanted to throw it across the room, but I would never do that. COULD never do that, she loved that damn phone. She loved being able to have her pictures and music all together and play her phone games. She would sit and watch short films and funny videos for hours after she should be sleeping. It was her guilty pleasure, that phone. That's when the thought struck me. 


I remembered the funeral director told me I could place items in her casket that were important to her, and I decided then and there, I would clone her phone on my computer to save all her data and pictures and I would give her her phone. I loved the idea of her playing her phone games and laughing at videos in the afterlife. The thought made me smile and took a sliver of the grief away. I knew it was silly, and I didn't know how long her cell bill was paid up for, but I just couldn't stop thinking about how fitting it would be. She always did joke about coming back to haunt me just to play her games and watch videos, so why not give her something to tie her over until she sorted out how to haunt me to get her fix? 


Her funeral was sad but lovely. She was surrounded in her favorite flowers, tiger lilies and birds of paradise. Woman after woman came up to me and told me how much of a difference my mom made in their lives. I thought of all the lives that she'd touched and all the people she helped throughout her life. Despite my grief I couldn't help but to be proud of my mom, and proud to be her daughter. Getting home after the wake and more condolences I finally sat down on mom's couch and turned my ringer on for the first time since I left for the funeral. Immediately I got a missed text notification. 


Mom: I love you too..


I stared at my phone. The text I had sent her the day she died was there right before it, so I knew it wasn't a spoofed number. I thought for a minute that this was some prank, but I couldn't figure out who would do something like this. I decided to assume it was a well meaning friend of my mom's who maybe shared her number. 


Me: Please don't text me from this number. This is my mom's number and she just passed away. 


I waited. I saw the ... of typing. My heart was in my throat as I waited to get a text back from whoever was using my mom's phone number. 


Mom: I'm at *redacted location* can you come visit me??


My heart froze in my chest. I hadn't noticed on the first message. I was too freaked out. Two periods. I reread the second message, that was the cemetery's location, with two question marks. She had to have been buried alive! I called the funeral director and begged him to meet me back at the plot, something was wrong. He swore up and down she couldn't be alive, they didn't do an autopsy but she was dead. I just cried and begged and showed him the texts until he finally agreed to meet me and help me find out what was going on. I put that phone in my mother's casket myself before they sealed it and lowered it down, nobody has that phone but her. Finally convinced nothing would soothe my panicked crying, he called an emergency exhumation. The ground was still freshly filled in so getting her dug up fast was easy. They opened her casket and her phone was in her hand rather than in the purse at her side I had put in there with her. On her screen was an unsent message to me


Mom: Under me..


That was the day they found the first body. Teenaged girls had been disappearing over the years at a slightly raised rate for the last six years or so, but most were assumed to be runaways and ignored. Families had begged for the police to look for their children but it fell on deaf ears. It turns out the cemetery caretaker would stake out grieving families. He was stalking the girls and would then kidnap them when they were coming home from school. He would kill them and bury them under fresh graves before putting in the casket and filling them in, hiding all evidence of his crimes in plain sight. After finding his map and his ""souvenirs"", they were able to give closure to twenty seven families. To me the most chilling evidence they found that a detective reluctantly showed me at my insistence. It was a collection of pictures of my mom's funeral where my thirteen year old niece's picture was circled.  


I know you guys are going to ask so I'll tell you, I did get one last text from my mom. It was a week after all the media calmed down and I was able to return to my grief. It's hard to grieve when people are questioning you about everything and calling you a hero. I knew I wasn't but they just didn't want to listen to my story, they just assumed I saw something before they lowered mom's casket down. So after I finally got a chance to sit down and be alone, I put on one of my mom's favorite horror movies, and I texted her one last time. I didn't expect anything supernatural, I just felt like it would give me a little closure. 


Me: I love you mom. I miss you so much. I hope you are happy wherever you are now. 


I set my phone down and wiped away the tears that were flowing freely. This movie was still as good as the first time she showed it to me and it's cathartic to feel these emotions. I was genuinely startled when my mom's text ringtone went off. 


Mom: I love you too honey, and I am.",Entertainment
nosleep,I found an extremely bizarre internet survey,"Nobody knows what rock bottom truly is until they've hit it. 

Being abruptly fired from a job you've worked at for the past ten years, and then catching your girl cheating on you with your replacement really makes a man think. 

Hell, *my student loans aren't even paid off yet*.

What a shitshow this life is. 

After a rather boozy night that consisted of sending out about four dozen resumes and horrendously written cover letters, I passed out. 

When I woke up the next morning, I decided to at least *try* and make some money at home while waiting for an interview. 

At that moment, I thought that the best way to go about it was completing those internet surveys that yielded 5 dollar subway gift cards and other shit like that after about an hour of answering questions. I mean, I didn't have any other marketable skills that could've yielded immediate income. 

It was either that or wasting the day away playing computer games. At least I wouldn't have to pay for food. 

I did these surveys for about 5 hours before nearly passing out. It was way more excruciating then I'd originally anticipated. At the end of those 5 hours, I'd accumulated about $45 in cash and gift cards. 

$9 an hour. Not like I was making much more than that before. I was about to close my laptop up for the day and head to a bar in an attempt drown out my melancholy when I first saw it. 

It shouldn't even have been noticeable... but for one reason or another, it was. At the bottom corner of the website that I was on, existed a tiny, singular advertisement. Maybe it was the simplicity that got me. Plain black letters in a tacky font that read ""Surveys for cash"" overlapped a completely white background. 

At least they were direct with the message. *One more couldn't hurt*, I thought. Might as well scrape together a little bit more booze money before heading out.  

I sat back down, clicked on the picture link and prepared myself to grind through some more painstaking inquires. The first few questions were simple enough. I guess they weren't really questions, but more data collection. My name, age and occupation. I thought it was kind of weird that they also asked my height and weight, but it wasn't unheard of. 

The first **real** question was a different story though. I must have stared at it, eyes wide and mouth agape, for god knows how long. 

*What the actual hell?*

In plain English, this is what popped up on my screen: ""How strong is your urge to currently look behind you?"" 

There were five options below, ranging from ""Not at all"" to ""overwhelming"". 

There was no feasible reason why I should've been afraid at that moment. *But I was*. I tightened my breathing, trying to make out any subtle noises behind me. There were none. After maybe about five minutes, I worked up the courage to look. There was nothing. I sighed in relief and scoffed at myself at the same time. 

This must have been some kind of joke. However, I decided to entertain it, answering ""neutral"" and clicking onto the next question. This is what it read: ""Why would you look behind you?"" 

I smirked. *Funny*, before simply typing in a ""I don't know"" in the response box and once again clicking next. This was the 3rd question: ""You're on a plane. Apart from you, there is only one other passenger, who is sitting somewhere behind you. At some point, you get up to go to the washroom, and find that the man is gone. You check to see if he is in the only bathroom on the plane, but he isn't. What do you do?""

Again, I must have stupidly stared at it for nearly ten minutes. Was this some kind of obscure personality test? I mean, it must have been, right? *Right?* 

I put the same answer that I used for the last question: ""I don't know."" It was true. I didn't know. How was I *supposed to* answer this shit? 

I click next again, now more intrigued than anything. The 4th question went like this: ""You wake up in woods unfamiliar to you. It's nighttime, and the moonlight provides you with only slight visibility. About thirty feet away from you, there is a small, dimly illuminated cabin. The door is open, and a smiling woman is motioning for you to come in. Do you go? Explain why."" 

This question wasn't necessarily weirder than the last one, so my conjecture that this was some kind of odd personality test was still feasible. I actually make an attempt to answer this one, something along the lines of going into the cabin because there's simply nowhere else to go. 

Once again, I click next. Probably shouldn't have. 

The questions started getting *fucked up*. They weren't too gory or explicit, not anything like that. They were just stranger. Weirder. More psychologically disturbing. If you're wondering why the hell I kept going, I can't really give you an explicit answer to that. I just felt like I *had to*. It was an esoteric, creeping sensation that I can't quite explain away. But I could never shake it. So I just went on. 

Some of the questions that stood out were:

""Suppose that you wake up one night to find an elevator in your house. During every midnight after that, it opens up for five minutes, revealing an exact copy of yourself that gets progressively more injured as time goes on. Do you keep living like this? Or do you enter the elevator once and end it all?""

And:

""You're in a hotel room but are awoken by a rapid knocking at your window. You peek through the blinds, seeing what appears to be a man missing both his eyes. He puts his mouth to the glass and tells you to kill the woman in the bathroom immediately. Do you listen to him?"" 

This was one of my least favorites:

""You are watching home videos with your mother. One of the tapes include footage of her being murdered by a masked intruder. Your mother simply laughs at this footage without saying anything. In your opinion, is this a cause for concern?"" 

In addition to this insanity-inducing shit, there were some rather disconcerting events happening in *real life* as well. I received a knock at the door about thirty minutes in. I looked through my peephole to find a guy standing there, frantically shaking his head and mouthing ""no"" while making direct eye contact with me. He looked terrified. Obviously, I didn't open up. 

I received about ten phone calls from somebody named ""the auditor"" on my caller ID. They left a message every time, but each one was just a recording that consisted of somebody saying numbers through heavy static. Actually, it sounded more like *screaming* now that I think about it.

About an hour into this thing, and I was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I was petrified of looking behind me, even though there was no indication that anything should've been there. I heard some soft scratching coming from my vent at one point, so I moved my couch over it. 

Eventually, I reached what appeared to be the end of the survey. However, it wasn't a question. It was simply a statement. 

""Don't let them in. They're not to be trusted."" 

Almost as if it were on cue, I heard more knocking at my door about five seconds after reading this. As slowly and silently as I could, I moved over and looked through the peephole once again. It was a different person than the one I'd seen earlier. She was a woman, looking to be in her mid twenties. She was wearing a thick blazer, despite it being around 90 Fahrenheit outside. She was also wearing sunglasses, so I could never really tell where she was actually looking. She eventually took a piece of paper out of her pocket and slipped it under the door. 

I look down and read it. 

""It's lying. Leave your apartment immediately."" 

It's been about half an hour since. I can't bring myself to look at the computer screen nor at the woman outside. She's still there. I can see the shadows of her feet from underneath my door. I heard my bedroom window open a few minutes ago, but I've since jammed the door shut with a chair. I can hear some kind of distorted muttering coming from behind it now. 

Maybe rock bottom wasn't so bad. 

*But what the fuck am I supposed to do here?* ",Entertainment

She hesitated a moment before breaking into a smile.  “Is that what you call me?  I like it.  My name is actually Melanie though.”

I felt my face reddening.  Of course her name wasn’t actually Rachel.  That was just something I made up in my head.  Still, my embarrassment couldn’t keep up with my confusion and joy.  “Is it really you?”

She nodded.  “Yeah, it’s me.”

Rachel…Melanie grunted as I stepped forward and started hugging her.  Laughing, she hugged me back for a moment, but then she whispered in my ear.  “Thomas, we need to talk, and not out here.  Can we go inside?”

I broke away and nodded, wiping at my eyes as I tried to finish unlocking the door with a shaking hand.  My heart was pounding and I still felt like I was in a strange and wonderful dream, but when we had gotten inside and sat down on my living room sofa, I forced myself to focus on the biggest question I had.

“How?”

Melanie had still been smiling as we sat down, but now she looked worried and sad.  “Thomas, that’s what I’m here to tell you.  Things aren’t like you think they are.  They never have been.”

I frowned, a new line of fear cutting through my happy haze.  “What do you mean?”

She held the bridge of her nose for a moment, looking down like she was trying to figure out how to say…whatever it was she had to say.  “Thomas…you’re part of a psychological experiment.  I’ve been a part of it for longer than you have as one of the actors, and I still don’t know all the details.  I’m pretty sure it’s run by some government agency, and I know they’re investing a lot of money and time into it, but for what reasons…that I’m not so sure.”

I realized I was wringing my hands.  No, that wasn’t right.  It couldn’t be right.  This was some kind of trick.

Melanie went on.  “What I do know is that you’re being watched as a long-term subject.  They have constructed this whole scenario where you do a secret job watching someone…me…who looks like they might be trapped.  They give you instructions and a way of making choices.  You’ve got buttons or something you can choose between, right?”

I nodded weakly, my tongue thick in my throat.  “Yeah.  A red one.   And a green one.”

She sighed and nodded.  “I think they’re testing how much you’ll obey.  What choices you’ll make based off of your morals, your intelligence, and your fear.  It’s interesting, or at least I thought so when I first joined up six years ago.  They’ve never officially given me many details, just the overall gist.  But people talk.  The other actors and me, sometimes we hear things, and we gossip.”  She smiled sadly.  “That’s what caused me to start feeling bad.”

I interrupted.  “Other actors?”

Melanie’s eyes widened.  “Oh shit, yeah.  Sorry.  I think they still call him Mr. Solomon?  And there are others too.”  When I just stared at her, she went on.  “Anyway, for a long time it was just the normal job, right?  I spend six hours a day acting like I’m this trapped girl, mainly faking painting or watching t.v.  You know, boring stuff…”

I couldn’t help but interrupt again, hating the hurt trembling in my voice.  “You fake the painting?  You aren’t really painting those wonderful pictures?”

Now Melanie looked embarassed.  “No, sorry.  I can’t paint a bit.  I’m a pretty good singer though.”  She tried to smile, but faltered.  Reaching forward, she touched my arm.  “That’s why they always have the paintings turned where you can’t see them.  They’re already done beforehand.  All you ever see is some blank canvases and…well, when they *want* me to show you something.”  Her expression darkened as she went on.

“That’s why I had to break the rules and contact you.  When they started doing this hidden message, mind game bullshit, I got worried.  Worried you would take it too serious.  That you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself.  As soon as you left your shift tonight, I talked to one of the guys in the video department.  He told me about how you had reacted.  Showed me how you were still parked down the street from the building.  I drove over—the bedroom set is in a building outside of town.  I saw you sitting in your car, and I almost approached you then, but I was scared of getting caught and fired.  So I parked and waited until I could follow you somewhere else and let you know I was okay.”

She blinked back tears.  “I’m ashamed to say I almost left a couple of times.  I don’t want to lose this job, and I tried to tell myself you would be okay after a day or two.  I could get them to change the script enough that you felt like I was okay and wouldn’t worry too much.”

I felt an angry heat growing in my chest.  “Well, that’s nice of you.”

She looked up, her eyes red.  “I know.  I’m a shit.  I’m so sorry.  I was being selfish and cowardly, but I didn’t actually leave.  And then when I saw Charlie leaving the building, saw you running over to talk to him, I knew they were escalating it even further.”

“Charlie?”

Melanie rolled her eyes in frustration.  “Shit, yeah.  Sorry.  Charlie Jefferies.  He’s another actor.  In an earlier version of the experiment he actually played Mr. Solomon, but they decided he wasn’t scary enough, so now he’s usually in one of the suits.  He’s actually done that for your version a lot, you just can’t recognize him under all that get-up they wear.”

I kept curling and uncurling my hands on my lap.  It was all too much.  I felt like a pinball going between anger and relief and embarassment and confusion.  “So all that stuff he told me?  That was all just to scare me?  See how I’d react?”

She nodded as she sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.  “Yes.  I’m sorry.  That’s why I knew I couldn’t wait any longer to tell you.  I could see how worried and scared you were going back to your car.”

I pulled my arm back from her touch.  “Well, thanks I guess.  At least you stopped me before I went to the police and looked like a joke in front of them too.”  I just wanted her gone, her sympathetic, pitying eyes off of me.  “Thanks for stopping by and letting me in on it.”  I tried to make my voice sound hard and unfeeling, but it came out watery instead.  Standing up, I turned away from her so she couldn’t see as I started to cry.  “If you don’t mind, I…uh…I need time to think about everything.  It’s…a lot.”

A moment passed and then her hand was on my shoulder.  “Thomas, you don’t have anything to be embarrassed about.  They are very good at what they do.  All you did was what you thought was right.  Because you’re a good man.”  I shrugged.

“I thought that you were in trouble and I wanted to help.”

She gently turned me toward her, and when I looked up, she smiled and sniffed again.  “I know, but you need to realize, most people wouldn’t have tried to help.  Not when it meant giving up their job or risking themselves like that.  Not for a stranger.”

I wiped at my face as I looked away.  “Well, I still feel dumb, but I’m glad it’s not real.  I’m glad you’re okay.  That we both are.”  I paused and caught her eye again.  “We are, aren’t we?  Safe, I mean.”

She hesitated before nodding.  “Yeah, I think so.  Like I said, they have a lot invested in whatever this is, and the fact that they’re willing to go as far as they have with you makes me wonder, but I’ve never seen any signs of anyone getting hurt.  I think the worst that could happen is one or both of us gets fired.”

I felt my face getting red again.  “Oh, don’t worry about that.  I’m going to quit tomorrow.  I’ll finally get to hit their damn buttons.  Maybe both of them.”  I started to smile, but then I saw the look on Melanie’s face.

“Thomas, please don’t do that.  I don’t think they would hurt us, but if you up and quit, they’ll figure out I’ve talked to you.  I don’t think they watch us all the time, but I don’t know what they can find out.  You know, tracking cellphones, spy satellites, whatever.  I’m taking a big risk just being here, and I don’t want them catching on.”

I took a step back from her.  “So you want to keep getting paid to trick people like me.”

She reached out and grabbed my right hand.  I had been clenching it unconsciously, and it relaxed at her touch.  “No, I don’t want to.  But I wasn’t expecting this.  How the experiment has changed, getting to actually meet you…I can’t do it long-term, but another month or two to save up money?  Now that you’re in on it and won’t be scared or hurt by it any more?”  She smiled.  “That I can do.  That we can *both* do.  We can keep going like normal, take some more of their money, and then one of us can quit.  The next month, the other one can.  How does that sound?”

I shrugged uncertainly.  It made some sense, and once I had calmed down, it would probably make more.  She gave my hand a squeeze.

“And when this is all over, I want to get to know you better.  I know I’ve been playing a role, but for the most part, that’s been me you’ve been watching all this time.  I think it’s only fair I get to see more of you too.”  She blushed.  “Assuming you’re interested in that.”

I felt my hand growing clammy in hers as my stomach fluttered.  “Well, I mean…yeah.  Yeah, I would really like that.”  Swallowing, I added, “How long do we have to wait to see each other again?”

Melanie grinned at me.  “Work another month or so.  Save what you can.  And then quit.  I’ll wait another two or three weeks, and then I’ll do the same.  And then…”  She looked up at the ceiling as she pondered it for a moment, and I was struck again by how beautiful she was, even if she was a little different in person than I had imagined.  ”…three months from tonight we’ll meet right here.  I’ll come over and we can start getting to know each other better.  How’s that sound?”

Returning her smile, I nodded.  “That sounds great.”  

****

When she left a couple of minutes later, part of me hated to see her go, but another part was relieved.  I was so exhausted, and while I was so happy she was okay and we had finally met, I felt like the burned up wire in an old lightbulb.  I needed time alone.  Time to think and calm down, and most of all, time to rest.

I didn’t really even remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, I realized my alarm had been buzzing for over thirty minutes.  I jumped up and raced to get to my shift at work.  As she had been leaving, Melanie had stressed again how we needed to act completely the same.  That meant not freaking out, but it also meant not acting like everything was okay either.  If I suddenly showed no signs of being worried about her, that would tip them off too.  I promised and she left after a brief hug and kiss.  Remembering that now, through the haze of my tiredness the night before, it felt like a dream.

Still, I went into the surveillance room with a much lighter heart.  I didn’t have to worry or feel guilty any more about not helping her, and there was some satisfaction in finally pulling one over on the people that had tricked me for so long.  Besides, in three months I would be done with this place and get to see Ra…Melanie again.  In person, at least.

Because I got to watch her on the video feed as soon as I came into work.  She was asleep when I first got there, and I found myself wondering if she was as tired as I still felt.  When she woke up later and started reading a book, I found myself beginning to smile and had to stop myself.  I should still be worried acting, not smiling like I had a crush.  I had to do better so Melanie didn’t get in trouble.

An hour or so later she started working on another of “her” paintings.  Watching her work, I was amazed at how real it all looked.  It was hard to see everything from my angle, but I would have sworn she had paint on those brushes and was really painting whatever was on the canvas.  I found myself feeling proud of her.  She really was a great actress.  Not only didn’t I see her giving any clues that we had met or talked, but she really did seem different in the room than she had in my apartment.  I supposed that was what she had meant by “playing a role”. 

I was almost at the end of my shift, and while I hated to leave her, I had to admit that I was ready for some more sleep.  Trying to guard my reactions all day had been exhausting, and I was dreading the next few weeks.  But then I realized she was done painting.  I expected her to just go and do something else, but instead she picked up the canvas at its edges and carefully walked it over to the sofa.  Her body was blocking it at first, but then she stepped aside.

It was a painting of a massive tree.  The bark was a dark red, with a huge twisting trunk that broke off into a dozen branches.  Those branches were covered in leaves that were so deep green they almost reminded me of storm clouds more than the top of a tree.  Like all the paintings, I felt touched by it, even now that Melanie had told me she didn’t paint them.  The images themselves, combined with the colors and the small details…they really were amazing.  

Just like this one.  If you looked close enough, you could see that there were several small blackbirds in the branches of the tree.  It was funny, but they almost looked like they were…

It almost looked like they were made out of words.

I felt my heart start to hammer and I forced myself to stay calm.  No point in being silly.  I knew it was all a game now, and I just had to play my part a little while longer.  Still, the worried me would want to know what the words said, so I might as well try to read them.  I squinted, following the birds right to left and top to bottom.

**That**
&nbsp;

**girl**
&nbsp;

**isn’t**
&nbsp;

**me**
&nbsp;



I looked away from the painting to see Rachel staring up at me.  She looked terrified.

nosleep,My Husband Brought Home a Fake Daughter,"*This is not my child.*

That was all I could think. 

“Honey?” said my husband. “Is everything all right?”

“Who is this?” I said, staring at the little girl I’d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter’s clothes. “Where is Liza?”

My husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. 

“What do you mean?” said my husband. “Are you feeling all right?”

*Why was he evading my question? Why couldn’t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.

“I’ll be all right,” I said, “as soon as you tell me where my daughter is.”

My husband frowned, and the little girl’s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. 

“Go on upstairs, honey,” he said. “Mommy’s not feeling well.”

The girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter’s room slam. The look on my husband’s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.

“You haven’t been taking your medication,” he said. “Don’t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.”

I waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. 

“I don’t need them,” I said. “They make my mind all fuzzy.”

The anger on my husband’s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. 

“Do you remember what happened the last time you said that?” he asked. 

“I...”

The suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.

*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*

I felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.

My husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.

“Shhh,” he cooed. “It’s not real, honey. I promise that it’s not real.”

I silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. 

Soon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. 

Of course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn’t me who had been driven insane by our daughter’s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.

But, most importantly, I knew that if I didn’t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.

Just like he did the last time.

What I learned 
https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cjzfky/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app



I sat all morning thinking about everything, cup after cup of coffee in front of me to keep me awake. Once the postman had left and I was alone with my thoughts they just continued to get louder. 

I thought about Natalia and the cult. About the kids and their nighttime antics. About the committee meeting. Jamie and how much I missed him, Georgia and my burning guilt and Mr Prentice, who was finally making those aforementioned animal noises.

Most of all I thought about the note left for me on move in day. How it had changed everything. My whole life was different now, I was alone and it felt like my new home was attacking from every angle. 

I re read the note a few times over my coffee. I worried about my rent, it was tight but manageable. School is currently out in the uk but as a training teacher assigned to a school I still get paid a small amount through the summer. The rent is low and with a second summer job I can just about make it without Jamie. 

It sounds strange. But it felt nice to worry about something normal for a minute; even if I should have been worrying about my survival and the many entities currently trying to kill me. 

I didn’t get to stew for too long, I had to get ready for the committee meeting. After the events of the night before and my growing mistrust of prudence it was imperative that I got the neighbours on side if I was going to achieve anything like my goals of eradicating the imposter/cultist neighbours. 

The meeting was at noon in flat 31, there was a poster on a communal notice board by the entrance that I was glad to spot, Terri hadn’t mentioned the time when we met and all our meetings since had been a bit hectic to discuss it. The poster promised tea and cakes and my stomach rumbled at the thought, I hadn’t eaten properly in days.  

At 11.55 I left the flat, and wandered out into the corridor. I’d never seen so many neighbours. Mr Prentice, however, was still making that awful noise and I watched in disbelief as every single person in the corridor walked past his door as if it was silent. 

I did my usual deliberation on whether to take the stairs or lift but yet again the stairs won. I still couldn’t bear being where Jamie died and all these extra flights were keeping me fit.

Flat 31 belonged to an older lady named Molly Thompson and her husband Eric. She had a blue rinsed head of curls attached to her head and had gone to the effort to make homemade batten-burg cake. Other neighbours had bought along baked goods as well. It reminded me of a school fair.

The flat itself was decorated for the 70s, with plenty of china cat ornaments littered around. I sat down on a dusty plastic garden chair, one of many that Molly seemed to have acquired and laid out for the residents pouring in. I hadn’t seen community spirit like this in my life. 

I smiled as I saw Terri, Eddie and Ellie wander in. It was nice to see some familiar faces. I had noticed people looking at me, wondering who I was. It probably wasn’t often they got new neighbours. Eddie came running up to me, swung his arms round me and sat down in the rickety garden chair next to mine. It was so sweet. Terri smiled at me and took a seat the other side of mine, Ellie sat next to her brother. The brown puppy dog eyes were back. No claws.

“I’m glad you came!” Terri said to me, loud enough to hear over the voices of the other neighbours. “I really want you to see the good side of the block. We don’t bite really!” She laughed nervously as she realised the irony of her statement. 

“Terri I need help, we need to stop those people from coming back again and from terrorising people. The block can’t go on like this.” I wanted to make the purpose of my attendance clear to her, it was time for things to change. 

“But if you don’t let them in then they don’t bother you. I’ve spoken to the kids, they know not to do it again, that those people are dangerous.” She paused for a moment and sighed. “Although them running away didn’t help, the kids think they’re indestructible now. They’ve been telling me all morning that they’re going to kill the bad guys.” 

She looked so resigned. But it was true, they did run away from the twins. Maybe there was something in that, I knew they could die I just had to work out how. But as the thought crossed my mind and I looked at Eddie and Ellie, I couldn’t imagine taking the risk.

I could’ve flat out gone back and asked Prudence. But to be honest I didn’t want anything to do with her. She gave me such a bad feeling. I was doubting everything she told me.

“It doesn’t matter if you can keep them away. We can’t all live in fear. Yours aren’t the only kids in this building.” I knew this from surveying the room. “But I bet not all the kids here are as ... special ... as yours. What if another family burns to death because their kids were hyper one night.”

I could see this struck a chord with Terri. She looked at me with glassy eyes as if on the verge of tears. 

“You’re right. Molly’s the chairwoman and she can be a little strict but you can bring it up under any other business.” She spoke with a lump in her throat. “Here you go by the way.” She handed me a piece of printed paper. 

Any other business felt a bit lacklustre but it would do. As long as it got discussed. 

I turned my attention the the piece of paper, it was the agenda for the meeting. For something written so formally it appeared farcical. It seemed other flats and floors had different but equally strange issues to mine. 

There were only 6 items on the agenda for the meeting with AOB as the 7th. They were as follows. 

*1. Welcome and introductions with apologies for absence.*

*2. Replacing of the flickering lights on floor 11, it seems to incite vicious behaviour from the pets and elderly of that floor.*

*3. Serving a formal residents letter of concern to the man who doesn’t move from the bottom of the stairwell on floor 5.*

*4. Finances - budgets for general maintenance and the annual barbecue.*

*5. The stairs with no grip leading up to floor 14 at the very top and the health and safety hazards this presents.*

*6. Soundproofing of Mr Prentice’s flat, number 48.*

I was comforted to know that I wasn’t alone in dealing with all these strange occurrences. I was also chilled to the core to know for certain that it was the entire building that was more than a bit odd. 

What really struck me as odd is that when I thought about it, I had seen that man on floor 5 when going down the stairs. But I’d never noticed that it had been every time, or that he had never moved, until this moment. 

The meeting begun with a loud and dissatisfying clink. 

By this point the tiny, 70s themed flat was packed. Garden chairs had all ran out and people were standing. Molly Thompson stood up from her floral patterned arm chair and bashed a teaspoon against the outside of her cup. 

She reminded me of a very strict, disciplinarian school teacher I had worked with during my university placement. She commanded quiet in the room. 

“I think we should get started everyone!” She shrilled, her voice growing louder with every word until the crowd came to a silent hum.

“Right, firstly, we are not going to skip the introductions today. Apologies have been given by Jo and Steph of flat 2 and yet again by Mr Prentice. We have a new face in the room as I’m sure many of you have noticed.” She gestured to me and looked in my direction but didn’t really make any eye contact. She was just talking about me as I sat in the room. Eventually she addressed me directly. 

“Stand up dear, introduce yourself. We’re pleased to have you here.”

I was deeply uncomfortable. I could feel some sort of panic coming on. I never liked standing in crowds very much. But I stood up anyway. 

“Ermm, hi. My name is Kat. I live in flat number 42, I moved in with my boyfriend Jamie but he was killed in the lift by the weird rat creatures you people have living here. The people that claim to live in the burned out flats won’t leave me alone and one in particular seems to want me dead. Oh, and that window cleaner outside my flat makes me want to scoop my own eyes out with a spoon every time he knocks on the door. Nice to meet you all.” The crowd had gasped a little.

I sat down. Instantly mortified, I don’t know what happened, the normality and structure of the meeting overwhelmed me. There’s something about a sense of order and normality amongst chaos. It does something to your brain, and for me, for the first time in this whole journey, it sent me into a meltdown. 

I sobbed as I hit the chair, both in pure mental exhaustion and disappointment that I had blown my chance at building any sort of army against Natalia. Terri rubbed my shoulder. Molly broke the awkward silence that had blanketed the room. 

“Nice to meet you Katherine, I understand life in this building can be a little overwhelming. We did ask the previous occupant to let us intervene when you moved in but she was insistent. In hindsight we may need to review our policies on new tenants. I am so very sorry for the loss of your partner. The lift is a most unfortunate situation.”

She had been in positions of power in her life for certain, she responded professionally but coldly, there was no feeling in her condolences. She came off like a corrupt politician digging themselves out of a hole. She did decide to skip the introductions after my outburst.

I also hate it when I’m called Katherine. My parents named me Katie and I shorten it to Kat. Her presuming it was Katherine added to her school teacher demeanour. 

She carried on with the proceedings pretty swiftly and interesting characters present at the meeting started to emerge. 

My favourite was a large middle aged Caribbean woman named Precious St Fluer who would not accept Molly’s claims that there was not enough in the budget to replace the lighting on floor 11.  

She got up and lifted her shirt to reveal a large deep bite mark across her stomach caused by her dog after a long episode of the lights flickering. When that didn’t change Molly’s answer she lifted her trouser leg to reveal a smaller, but still noteworthy bite mark on her leg, from her elderly mother who lives with her. Molly didn’t budge.

It took what felt like an eternity to get to any other business. If I weren’t so focused on my goal I would have enjoyed hearing about the quirks of the other floors, maybe tried to engage a little, but I just couldn’t concentrate. 

When the chairwoman asked if anyone had any other business she scanned the room quickly. I stood up from my chair and she locked in on me with her eyes. 

My hands were shaking and I could feel a cold sweat forming all over my body.

“Katherine, what can we help you with dear?” She asked in a patronising tone. 

“I want help in getting rid of the people pretending to be from the burned out flats. I can’t be the only person that doesn’t like living in fear.” I stated boldly, trying not to break down again.

“Dear we have had this discussion multiple times and it’s been taken off the agenda. I am aware you’re new here but there is nothing we can do about certain problems within this building and for this particular issue we would appreciate you not letting them into your home and ignoring them like the rest of us.” She snapped back. 

“But that’s not good enough! Terri’s kids answered the door last night, they’re children, it’s easily done, what if someone else’s child does it and aren’t so lucky to survive. One burned my friend so bad a few nights ago that she’s still unconscious in hospital.” This I knew from social media. 

A few people called out in agreement with me from the crowd. 

“The only one who has ever been able to deal with them is Prudence. And that difficult woman never revealed her methods. Don’t think we didn’t try. You’re suggesting a suicide mission. You’d do well to remember you are new here.” Molly hissed through her teeth. 

Did she have to mention I was new so many times. It was grating on me. 

“Well I’m willing!” Shouted Precious. She seemed stronger than the rest in her earlier rant. I was glad to have her on side. 

Where she came forward, a few others followed. Soon I had 5 people plus myself willing to form a sub committee to get rid of the cultists. Molly didn’t like it but she agreed to let us do it.

There was me, Precious and Terri along with lady named Shanti who lived a few doors from me. 

A man named Anton and his friend Leo from floor 8 made up the group. To be honest they just seemed keen to get involved with any kind of battle. Leo was the loud one, Anton was mostly silent. 

I invited them to my flat after Molly swiftly adjourned the meeting. Inviting anyone into my home made me anxious now. I found myself studying each of their faces to ensure they’re weren’t too average and I hadn’t invited the wrong people in. I was fairly certain I hadn’t. Eddie and Ellie settled in front of my tv in the bedroom so they didn’t hear our conversation. They may only be kids but I felt safer with them there. 

We discussed for hours how we could bring the imposter people into one place and kill them all. 

Leo was particularly creative, he came up with weird and whacky ways to end them; from locking them in a room and blasting with fire extinguishers until they freeze, to herding them into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am.

The whole time I waited nervously for a knock on the door, for them to come for us. But they didn’t. We got time to plan. But despite the time it never really took off, no idea seemed feasible. 

I shared everything I knew. My conversation with Prue, the night before in Terri’s flat... everything. Precious listened to my tales intently before speaking.

“Derek would have helped us. He was a great man, he used to turn up at my door in the dead of the night just as those lights started and take my dog for a walk.” She spoke of the gardener with a fondness. 

“Prudence told me about Derek. She said he’s been gone since the garden was demolished.” I replied flatly. 

“It was awful when he left. That woman that used to live here was nasty to him. I watched out my window as she tore up the garden. I know she was grieving for that little girl but I know Derek only ever wanted to help.” Shanti spoke up from the corner. She had been pretty quiet the whole time. “He was the whole reason we don’t have those awful creatures from the lift all over our homes anymore. My brother was killed by one before the agreement. He was 4 years old.”

I twitched as she told her story. Shanti has such sad eyes and speaking about her brother only filled them further with sadness.

“This is another thing I don’t understand. Why have any agreement, if you managed to kill most of them, why not all?” I asked, feeling anger over Jamie burn through my throat as I spoke. 

Precious laughed. Terri shot her a look from across the room. 

“No ones told you the whole story have they?” Shanti asked, a single tear running down her face. 

“What do you mean?” This was driving me insane, nothing was simple, how could I trust anyone. 

“When Prudence and some of the others killed the creatures they killed a large group of them in one hit. They had started to work out that food scraps and pet food were attracting them and they gathered all the pet food in the tower block into one empty flat on the floor the fire had happened. They creatures came in droves just like expected and they set the flat alight. Again.

“The flat was burned to ash on top of preexisting ash. Nothing could survive that.” Shanti was interrupted after this by Leo. 

“And then 3 giant rat motherfuckers literally rose from the ashes, triple as smart and strong and fucked shit up!” He said, a look of excitement on his face. 

Shanti rolled her eyes and continued. “So all Prudence did was cause a quite literally bigger problem. She didn’t kill them, all she did was help them evolve.

“There was only three of them but they learned to sneak attack. More people died than during the original infestation. They were more intelligent but not in the way it comes across when the agreements spoken about. We couldn’t speak to or reason with them.”

Terri was looking at the floor. 

“Only Derek was able to do that, he spoke to them like he spoke to the garden. He made it safe for everyone again, I wasn’t there. I was too young but there we were told he didn’t even have to use words. They understood just a series of movements and eye contact. 

“Derek explained the rule with the lift. He told us it was a gesture of goodwill. The creatures needed a home and seemed attracted to the building and we would let them live there and stop killing their kind if they would stop killing ours. But to show them some respect we would allow them a small time frame where unleash their instinctual nature. But only if someone came to them.

“There are only 2 left now. Prudence killed the other during what happened with her granddaughter. But that only made them 2 stronger. Like they absorbed the 3rd.” 

I tried to take in all the information I was receiving but I couldn’t. It was too much. 

“Derek isn’t coming back, it’s been years, this is pointless!” Terri finally erupted. Precious laughed again.

“How do you know?! You speak to dear old Prue all the time, know something we don’t?” Precious spoke sarcastically but I think she meant what she said. It was becoming clear that Prudence Hemmings wasn’t too popular in this building. 

“I don’t speak to her all the time! We just keep in contact, she was always nice to me!” Terri tried weakly to defend herself.

“That’s because you’re naive and a pushover! She used you because no one else would give her the time of day!” Precious was about to launch into a full rant on Terri. I was glad Eddie and Ellie were in the other room and couldn’t hear. I wondered if she’d seen them at night. 

I decided to stop the rant. This was becoming counter productive and we were getting nowhere with our plans. I interjected and told them all I needed them to leave so that I could sleep. Partly true, although I knew I couldn’t sleep. I had other things to do. 

They all filed out of my flat, Terri and the kids were the last to leave. She gave me a hug as she left and told me to get a proper nights rest, telling me she was always there for a cuppa and a chat. It was sweet. I felt sorry for Terri. The kids hugged me too as they left. 

I know she spoke to Prue, but I was certain that it really was entirely innocent. 

I sat in the empty flat disheartened that my assembling of an army had turned into a bickering shit show with no real suggestions on how to kill the imposter neighbours. 

I felt totally alone. I couldn’t trust Prue or Ian or pretty much anything I thought I knew. Maybe Prue didn’t even kill those neighbours. They only told me half truths about the creatures after all. 

I was left alone with my thoughts again. And after a few hours, a good one finally struck me, but I needed supplies.

I left the building and went to the nearest shop to gather the items I needed. For what I needed and the time of night I had to travel to a 24 hour supermarket. It took half hour each way on the bus. But I stayed focused. My bags were heavy and awkward on the way back to the block but if it paid off this was going to be worth it. 

I trudged up the stairs. It took me 2 trips and 24 flights of stairs instead of 14 to get everything in my flat and organise myself. 

It only took 16 and a large gym bag that was much easier to carry on the way back down, thankfully. 

I passed the man on floor 5 twice. Now I’d noticed him, he made my skin crawl a little. 

I walked through the downstairs corridor, diverting away from the main entrance and passing all the ground floor flats to the door at the back of the building.

The door at the back lead to a small concrete area with a grass strip along the side and a bench decorated with a memorial plaque. This was the blocks outside space. As is typical in the city the whole bench was covered in graffiti. The memorial was unreadable. 

I got to work. I dug the strip of grass, turning soil with my new equipment. I had never been green fingered and to be honest the shrubs I had bought had been so heavy I had grown to resent them a little. I worked for an hour and a half. I was sweating and night had come, it was pitch black and I was using my phone torch to see. 

I had almost given up until I got up from my crouching position to stretch my knees. I reached my arms out, put down my shovel and took a seat on the bench. 

I hadn’t seen him arrive but the man was already sat there. He wore a flat cap and a jacket, despite it being the middle of summer and a beautiful night. He just smiled warmly at the shrubs for a moment without a word. Eventually he spoke. 

“I’ve missed this place. Names Derek.”

nosleep,The Sisters of House Omega,"I was never the type to join a sorority. My twin sister, Chel, begged me to rush with her the summer before our freshman year approached, but I think she knew deep-down I was a lost cause. I was a band geek in high school, and a band geek I intended to remain.

Don't get me wrong - this isn't some ""not like other girls"" bullshit. I was happy for Chel. I even got trashed on celebratory wine coolers with her when she pledged her sorority. We just had different interests. As long as she was happy, that’s all that mattered, and I know she felt the same about me.

How did I miss that she was so deeply unhappy?

She threw herself off the bell tower in the center of campus less than 3 weeks before the end of the spring semester. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of days; I was holed up at the library pulling double all-nighters to finish my final paper for Greek and Roman Mythology. I woke up in the early afternoon on a Sunday to 10 missed calls from mom and a text from Chel. 

*love u forever Lou. i’m so sorry.*

2:55 a.m. Witnesses say she jumped at 3:02.

I skipped finals, took incompletes in all of my classes, and headed home to be with my mom. Alex, our best friend from high school, offered to bail on the rest of the semester too, but I didn’t want him to lose his scholarship. Still, he made the 2-hour drive home every weekend to hang with me. We didn't talk much; it still hurt too much to remember the good times, and I didn't care much about the present. But it was better than drinking alone, and Alex was generous with sharing his weed.

My mom insisted I get back into the swing of things this Fall. I decided just to do a half-time course load, mostly focused on finishing up my classes from last semester. I moved into a solo room in the dorms that’s more the size of a closet than a real livable space. I didn’t mind being alone. I kind of preferred it that way.

Alex, though, thought that the solitude was bad for me. Or at least that’s what he claimed when he dragged me along to a Greek party last weekend. Chel was popular among the guys in his fraternity, he said, and they’d all been asking about me. Worried. I really didn’t want to go, but Alex wouldn’t let up.

“It’s what Michelle would want, Louise.” 

Asshole. Even if he was right.

That’s how I found myself last Saturday in the passenger seat of Alex’s BMW, driving out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I quickly realized I had no idea where the hell we were or where we were headed. I’d never gone to a frat party with Chel - navigating a sea of sweaty dudes who smell like PBR isn’t my ideal night out - but I was pretty sure most frat houses weren’t 45 minutes from campus, tucked away off a dirt road that didn’t even have a name on Google Maps.

I picked at a fraying thread on the hem of my sweater, one of Chel’s. It was bright green and haphazardly cropped at the waist in a homemade chop job. It wasn’t my style at all, and I never would have worn it before Chel...before she was gone. But that night, wearing it gave me confidence, like she was there with me.

“So....what’s the deal with this party anyway? Or are you driving me out to the middle of nowhere to murder me?” 

Alex rolled his eyes and fished a piece of black cardstock out of the mess of napkins on his center console. The paper was heavy, expensive, with gold-embossed letters glittering in a scrolling font:

*You Are Cordially Invited*  
*The Sisters of House Omega welcome you to our Fall semester Culling.*  
*Attendance is mandatory.*  
*Only the true of heart will remain until dawn.*  
*Will that be you, Alex?*

“Did all the guys in the house get one of these?” I turned the paper over, where an address and time was listed. County Road 5. Midnight.

“Yeah, ‘bout a week ago? We’re still trying to figure out who’s hosting.” 

“It’s not this Omega sorority?”

Alex laughed at me, not unkindly. “There’s no such thing, Louise.”

I frowned. A party in the middle of nowhere, hosted by nobody? I was already starting to regret abandoning my resolve to live the semester as a hermit.

“None of this is creeping you out? What does it mean by ‘Culling,’ anyway?” 

“Ah, it’s just for dramatics. See who can stick it out all night, ya know? Maybe there’ll be a prize. And you know what?” He grinned and slapped me on the thigh. I slapped him back. “We’re not gonna pussy out. We’ll be the winners, last ones standing, just like old times. You with me?”

“I turn into a pumpkin after 2.”

“I’m serious, Lou.”

“So am I, *Alexander.*” He knew I hated being called Lou. Chel always called me Lou. “Besides, are they even going to let me in? I didn’t get one of these.” I shook the invitation in his face. 

I was starting to have a really bad feeling. If I’d known about all this weirdness beforehand, I would’ve already been in bed. Tossing and turning on my lumpy twin mattress, brainstorming ways to beg Professor Dickson for yet another extension on my first paper, sounded better than stumbling into the plot of *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*.

“C’mon, Louise, if it’s lame, we’ll bail. And they’ll definitely let you in. I mean, you look just like her, they’ll -”

“Feel sorry for me?”

I took grim satisfaction seeing the smile slip off his face. 

“No, absolutely not.” His lips pulled down into a frown and I looked away. “Louise,” his large hand grasped my fingers gently. His voice had gone soft.  “I just mean that everybody loved Chel, and they’ll love you too. Just like she did.” 

I looked out the window and blinked hard once, twice, before clearing my throat. 

“Fine. But the *second* I’m ready to leave, we’re leaving, prize be damned.”

Alex squeezed my hand and let go. “Deal.”

We continued the drive in silence. Alex drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and I scanned the empty fields on the side of the road. We’d pulled off on the county road over 10 minutes ago; we’d almost missed the turn-off, which was only marked by a small, weathered wood sign, embossed with a gold Omega symbol. There was still no sign of a party.

“Alex…”

Alex shifted in the driver’s seat and hunched over the steering wheel, squinting into the darkness.

“Yeah...it’s uh...I feel like we should have seen it by now.”

He laughed, high-pitched and thready. I continued unraveling the loose thread on the hem of Chel’s sweater.

The BMW crested a large hill, and I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. A large, white farmhouse stood in the valley below us, a fleet of Land Rovers and Mercedes parked haphazardly in the grass out front.  Alex laughed - much more genuinely, this time - and patted my knee as he parked next to a Lexus.

“Relax, it’s gonna be fun.”

I mustered up a smile but didn’t say anything. Alex grinned and hopped out of the car. I peered up at the house. The facade was bright and cheery, freshly painted with bright blue shutters flanking the windows, the front door a bubbly yellow. The interior, glimpsed through the open blinds, looked warm and inviting, and I could already feel the bass beat of a shitty pop song vibrating softly in my chest. It all looked pretty innocuous. Maybe I could have a good time. For Alex. 

*For Chel.*

The loud clunk of the passenger door opening startled me. Alex arched his eyebrow, forearm braced on the roof of the car.

“Are you coming, or were you planning to wait in the car all night?”

I rolled my eyes and unbuckled. I socked him on the arm as I climbed out of the car.

“Let’s have some fun or whatever.”

I didn’t need to worry about getting in the door. There was nobody checking invitations. We were greeted by a loud cheer of “Alex!” when we entered the living room, the party well underway.

A few guys ran up, thumping Alex on the back and nodding my way in polite acknowledgement. I was suddenly enveloped in a bear hug by a man whose name I couldn’t remember, overwhelmed by a cloud of Axe and sour beer-breath.

“We’re so glad you could make it, Lou. We miss Chel so much.”

A chorus of drunk voices chimed in, booming in the small space of the foyer.

“CHEL!”

Sour-breath let me go to pump his fist in the air, and the boys all started chanting Chel’s name. I couldn’t decide whether I was endeared or disgusted. Alex flushed and elbowed one of his brothers in the ribs. I was about to give him shit when another, much more slender arm wrapped around my shoulders.

“Oh, Louise! I didn’t know you were going to be here.” 

Anna, the president of Chel’s sorority, had to crouch down to hug me. Her words were slurred, her movements languid and clumsy, but her big brown eyes were clear and focused when she pulled back. Anna had always liked Chel, took her under her wing when she first started pledging, and she’d always made me feel welcome in the house. So it was out of the ordinary that she looked concerned, rather than pleased, to see me.

“Uh...yeah. Alex said it would be cool?” I glared in Alex’s direction. He just shrugged.

Anna’s brow furrowed, but before she could answer, another voice chimed in, rich and melodic.

“Oh? I didn’t realize this was Alex’s party.”

Anna froze, and her eyes widened. Slowly, she turned to face three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life. Despite their striking appearance, I don’t know that I could describe any of them now; it’s all kind of fuzzy in my memory, but I do know that they were supermodel tall, willowy, with bright eyes that seemed to stare right through you. One of the women - sparkling green eyes boring into mine - spoke again in the same resonant tone.

“Anna? Who’s your party-crasher friend?”

She smiled when she said it, and her tone betrayed no ill will, but I still shrank back behind Anna instinctually. I looked around again for Alex, but he had wandered off already. That set off distant alarm bells in my head, after all his promises that we would stick together, but I couldn’t focus on anything but the woman in front of me. Anna grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly.

“Oh, uh...this is, you remember Chel, the girl I told you about? This is her sister, Louise, and...well, I  think Alex just thought...”

Another of the three women, grey eyes this time, stepped around Anna in one smooth motion, interrupting her rambling. She grabbed my hand out of Anna’s and clasped it between both of her own. Her skin was cool, almost cold, but her grip was soft. I thought I was just rocking a stupid crush at the time, but the world seemed to tilt off center when she bent down to meet me at eye-level, voice whisper-soft yet strong enough to carry over the house music thumping through the floorboards.

“Darling, I’m so sorry about your sister, but I’m really not sure this party is your scene.”

Anna looked downright panicked by this point, falling all over herself to apologize to the trio. I scanned the crowd and, aside from Alex and a couple of his fraternity brothers, I only saw one other person at the party who looked familiar, a girl from Chel and Anna’s sorority - Beth? Stacy? - who I knew almost nothing about. Chel had never introduced me to her. A distant part of me registered that I should be embarrassed, or, that if Anna was panicking, maybe I should be too. Instead, I felt a strange sense of calm, content to follow wherever that voice might lead me.

“Of course, I didn’t mean to cause any trouble…”

The third woman stepped forward and rested a graceful hand lightly on my shoulder. Bright blue eyes danced kindly. I couldn’t look away.

“No trouble at all, sweetheart, just let me walk you to your car.”

Anna looked on helplessly as the two women guided me slowly to the door. A tiny splinter of logic somehow managed to pierce the haze that had settled over my brain.

“I don’t have a car. Alex drove me.”

Grey-eyes and blue-eyes looked at each other for a few minutes, seeming to have a silent conversation. Blue-eyes finally sighed and turned back to me. 

“Well then, I guess there’s nothing for it. Want to keep me company in the kitchen?”

I could feel the dopey grin splitting my face, but I couldn’t do anything to stop it. I nodded a bit too enthusiastically to be cool. Blue-eyes laughed; it sounded like bells. My mind sunk deeper into the fog.

It didn’t even cross my mind to go find Alex. I forgot about Anna’s frantic worry from just moments before. I let blue-eyes take my hand and lead me further into the house. I felt safe while I was with her. A peace I hadn’t felt since Chel’s death washed over me.

The next day, as the memories came back to me in flashes, I would realize how... *off* everything was. The whole house had this shimmery glow about it, like something out of a dream.  Alex’s fraternity brothers and the handful of girls from Chel’s sorority drank from seemingly bottomless red Solo cups and danced feverishly in the living room, pressed tightly together in a writhing mass; the rest of the partygoers did shot after shot in the kitchen, a never ending supply of vodka and tequila flowing freely, poured generously by the mysterious Sisters of House Omega. The Sisters themselves, each as stunningly gorgeous as the last, stood around the party’s periphery, laughing easily at the revelry without actually partaking in any of it themselves. All the while, those piercing eyes swept over the party with a calculated, unsettling intensity. 

Hindsight, of course, is 20/20. At the time, I was too swept up myself, too enraptured by ocean blue eyes, to notice anything odd.

I wish I could remember her name. Blue-eyes. In spite of everything that happened, I still find myself yearning to know more about her. She pulled me into a cozy bench seat in the corner of the kitchen, away from the worst of the noise. She tucked a stray hair behind my ear with long, graceful fingers, and the whole world fell away. She asked me to tell her all about myself. So I did.

I poured my heart out. I told her about what it was like coming out in high school in a small town in the Midwest, and how supportive Chel always was, even when Alex wigged out and didn’t talk to me for a month. I told her about my dreams of becoming a songwriter and making a break for the coast, about how that dream died with Chel because I couldn’t imagine anybody else singing my songs but her. I told her about all of my hopes and my desires, about my guilt at moving on to live a life that Chel and I had always planned to live together. I told her about my deepest fear: that I don’t know who I am without my twin sister, my other half. That maybe without Chel, I’m nothing at all. 

Looking back on it, I can’t remember what blue-eyes actually said to me throughout all of this. She certainly didn’t give away anything about herself, who she was, where she came from - not even her name. But I remember this overwhelming sense of comfort, of her telling me, maybe not in so many words, that I was *somebody*; I was important, I mattered. Even though she didn’t - couldn’t have - known me, somehow she *did*, and she loved me. She held me as I laughed and cried, and it felt like she was laughing and crying with me, feeling everything I felt just as deeply. 

The next part gets even fuzzier. At some point, blue-eyes took my hand and invited me upstairs. Usually this is the part where I lose my cool, especially with a woman so gut-wrenchingly beautiful, but the nerves never came. I felt like I was floating all the way up the stairs, to her room, to the edge of her twin bed. When she finally kissed me and pressed me back into soft sheets, galaxies exploded behind my closed eyes.

It didn’t go any farther than that, but it was somehow the most intimate experience of my life. I have no idea how long we stayed there, arms around each other, lips sliding together softly, sweetly. At some point, she pulled away to give me another of those deep, searching looks.. She opened her mouth as if to speak when, somewhere in the house, a clock started to chime midnight. 

Her head snapped toward the door. She ducked her head and sighed.

“Wait here, Lou.”

I nodded; it wasn’t a question. There was nowhere else I wanted to be. With one last press of her lips to mine, she was gone.

I flopped back onto the bed, idly wondering how long she would be gone and what we might get up to when she got back. Before I could follow that train of thought too far, a high-pitched, harsh shriek rent the night, painfully loud even over the pounding baseline from downstairs. More inhuman, screeching voices soon joined in.

I shot up in bed just as the dance music cut out with the painfully grating sound of feedback from the speakers. There was a series of terrible, thundering crashes, and a chorus of panicked screams sounded from the partygoers below.

The peaceful veil clouding my thoughts lifted in an instant. It finally caught up to me how *wrong* the situation was. I didn’t even really remember coming upstairs, and I hadn’t seen Alex in hours…

*Shit, Alex is down there.*

I ran to the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Distantly, I thought I could hear Alex screaming my name, scared and in pain, and I started slamming my body into the door, calling out for him until my voice was shredded. I looked around frantically for my phone, but it wasn’t anywhere in the room. I couldn’t remember where I had left it. Footsteps pounded down the hallway outside, a terrified scream coming closer, abruptly silenced when something slammed into the other side of the bedroom door with a wet, heavy thud. I stumbled back until my knees hit the edge of the bed. 

I sobbed and made a break for the windows instead. I was just about to take my chances jumping from the second story when a small TV in the corner of the room switched on, static buzzing at the highest volume. Half-wild, I thought briefly of chucking the whole TV through the windowpane before the blurred pixels started to resolve into a familiar face.

“No…”

There on the TV, impossibly, was Chel. My escape plan was quickly abandoned. I reached out to the screen with shaking fingers, as though I could reach through the cold glass and touch her face. 

The scene on the TV started to play. I couldn’t look away.

Chel was at a party in what I recognized as the basement of Alex’s fraternity house. She was trashed, drink sloshing over the rim of her cup onto her sweater. The sweater I was wearing that night. Alex stepped into frame, laughing, and poured more liquor into her cup.

“Easy, Chel, you’re going to lose the rest of your drink!”

“Can’t have that!” whooped a frat brother in the background. Alex turned and shot him a glare.

“When are the other girls gonna get here?” Chel’s voice was slurred, mumbling. “Is Lou still coming?”

A chorus of giggles sounded from the small handful of girls in the background. I recognized Beth/Stacy as one of the onlookers. Alex looked back at the crowd and swallowed. He smiled wanly at Chel.

“Yeah, Chel, she’s on her way. Listen - how about we play a game while we wait for her?”

My stomach felt like stone, bile clawing up the back of my throat. Distantly, I could still hear the rampage continuing in the house around me. Wails of pain and fear, shrieks of rage and triumph, and under it all, a thick, fleshy ripping sound. 

“A game?” Chel looked at Alex with unfocused eyes, brow furrowed. Something was seriously wrong. Chel never got that drunk.

“Yeah, it’ll be fun!” The men were circling up around Chel on the TV. The hair on my arms and neck stood up. Somebody in the real world was pounding on the door to the room, begging for help, but they sounded distorted and far away, like my head was in a fishbowl. 

“I don’t know, Alex, I don’t feel so good.” Chel swayed on her feet. Alex was practically holding her upright. 

“It’s OK, Chel, just one quick game and then we’re done, OK?” 

Alex was smoothing Chel’s hair away from her face, almost tenderly. The ugly, sinister anticipation in my gut was building. Chel and Alex always had a bit of a thing, but this didn’t seem like their usual flirting; it was a mockery of the sweet way Alex usually treated Chel. His eyes were filled with an odd mix of determination and regret, lust and anxiety.

The Chel on the TV was too far gone to have any of those same misgivings. Chel was always too trusting of people, quick to see the good in everyone. She smiled broadly and dropped her head onto Alex’s shoulder, wrapping her arms around him in a loose hug. Alex’s frat brothers were circling like sharks. I wrapped my arms around my own waist and fell to my knees, tears streaming down my face.

“Spin the Chel!” somebody yelled. Chel looked up, confused, and Alex grimaced and spun her quickly in a circle. She stumbled into the arms of another fraternity brother. She tried to push at him, but her movements were slow and weak. The guy forcibly kissed her, and then shoved her back toward Alex, who did the same. This continued, Chel tossed about like a ragdoll, sobbing my name in fear and confusion. She looked so lost, so *young*. I quit watching as soon as more hands started grabbing at her, pulling at her clothes. It wasn’t hard to guess what happened next.

I covered my ears and hunched in on myself on the floor, screaming, begging for it all to stop. 

I don’t know how long I stayed there. I didn’t even notice that everything had gone quiet until I heard the click of the bedroom door opening behind me. It was loud as a gunshot in the sudden silence. I stood up slowly and moved toward the door in a daze.

I stepped forward and barely registered the sick squelch of the rug under my feet. Red soaked the floor and the bottom 18 inches of the wallpaper, splattered in wide strokes on the upper walls and ceiling. A pile of gore that had once been a person slumped at the top of the stairs. A river of blood ran down the center of the staircase, thick and dark, flowing like a grisly red carpet to the open front door.

I stepped around mangled limbs and stringy viscera as I made my way carefully down the stairs. My mind was completely numb to the carnage; the sound of Chel’s helpless tears still filled my ears. Two steps from the front door, a faint voice gurgled to my left.

“Lou…”

Part of me wanted to ignore him. To just walk back out into the night, down County Road 5, back to my tiny, uncomfortable bed in my shitty dorm room, where I would fall asleep and this would all have been a nightmare. 

“Please*,* Lou.”

Movements rigid, I forced myself to turn toward the living room. My breath hitched in spite of my detachment.

There, on the floor in the middle of a sea of shredded bodies, was what was left of Alex. His blond hair was tinged pink with blood. One of his eyes dangled loosely from its socket; both legs were missing below the knees. He dragged himself toward me with his right arm, nails cracking against the hardwood floor. His left arm, flesh ripped down to bone and sinew, reached out for me, pleading.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. This was Alex - my best friend since kindergarten, Chel’s prom date, my first and last kiss with a man. This was *Alex*. The man who threw my sister to the wolves. Who raped her. 

The reason Chel was dead. 

“Did Chel say *please*, Alex? 

Alex choked on a bloody sob. I could see the guilt and shame awash in his one good eye.

“It wasn’t s’posed...go that far.” He coughed; blood spewed in a chunky froth across the hardwood. “*Please*, Lou, ‘m sorry.”

Groaning in agony, Alex inched closer to me. I remained still, body frozen with indecision.

“Shall we spare him?”

Ice trickled down my spine. The voice belonged to blue-eyes, there was no doubt, but it was different; a sonorous, echoing whisper, sighing on the wind like it came from everywhere at once.

A long-fingered hand settled on my shoulder. In the corner of my vision, I saw shiny curved, black talons resting near my collarbone. Just around the corners of the living room entryway, beyond my line of sight, I could make out the shadows of huge wings. Feathers rustled, claws tapped and clicked on the hardwood floor, impatient. Alex looked toward the noise, face twisted in fright. Blue-eyes squeezed my shoulder gently.

“I’m sorry, child. You weren’t supposed to be here. But we wanted you to understand.”

Alex looked at me again, pleading. He opened his mouth to speak, but I beat him to it.

“He’s all yours.”

As whatever monsters lurked in the shadows began to advance, the hand on my shoulder turned me away and steered me toward the door. Smooth, black feathers filled my peripheral vision, a large wing curled around my frame to block the sights and muffle the sounds of my former best friend’s demise. I stepped into the cool night air and closed my eyes. Lips brushed tenderly across my temple. 

“Be at peace, dear one.”

Everything went black.

I woke up late last Sunday morning, back in the dorms, tucked safely into my bed. For a couple of hours, I almost convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing. Every trace of the House Omega party has been scrubbed from existence - all of my text messages with Alex about it were gone, none of the sleek, black invitations remained. I thought briefly, hopefully, that maybe it had all just been a grief-induced nightmare.

Until the news broke that Alex’s entire fraternity and a handful of Chel’s sorority sisters had disappeared into the ether overnight.

The police have no leads. I know they won’t find any. I drove back out to County Road 5 a few days ago, after half a week of fielding concerned phone calls from my mom. There’s nothing there; just an empty field with an abandoned, decrepit farmhouse rotting in the prairie sun.

Alex’s mom has been calling me, too. To see if I’ve heard from him, if I have any clue what happened. I haven’t told her the truth. I’ve decided that I won’t. Sometimes lies are kinder. She doesn’t need to know what kind of monster her son was, what kind of monster he was killed by.

I spent most of the day today at the cemetery. I sat cross-legged in front of Chel’s headstone, tracing the letters of her name and thinking of everything I should have seen earlier, everything I missed. A shadow fell over me, breaking my reverie. 

“Mind if I join you?”

I squinted up into the afternoon sun. It was Anna. With everything else that had been going on, I had almost forgotten that she had even been there that night. I guess I had subconsciously catalogued her as one of missing. Apparently, officially speaking, she was never at the party either.

She helped fill in some of the gaps.

“Chel came to me, right after it happened,” Anna said, voice tight. She sat down beside me in the grass, close enough our thighs were touching. “I was furious, ready to call campus police, but she begged me not to. The boys, and some of our so-called sisters, had taken video of the whole thing, she said, and threatened to expose her if she got ‘too sensitive’ about it. I promised her I wouldn’t call. I wish every night that I had anyway.

I had decided I would connect her with campus resources instead, you know? Support groups for survivors, counselors, that kind of thing. I convinced myself it was good enough. But before I could make it happen she..” Anna choked on the words. She cleared her throat and breathed out harshly through her nose. “Well, I was too late. I would apologize to you, but an apology isn’t good enough.”

“You have nothing to apologize for, Anna. You tried to help her.” I squeezed her hand. She squeezed mine back.

“Still, I felt like I had to do *something*.” Anna stared at Chel’s headstone, eyes hard. “People like the men and women who hurt your sister, they think they’re invincible. Untouchable. And they’re not entirely wrong these days. With enough money, you can get away with anything, right?” She laughed, dry and humorless. “So I knew I had to reach out to a higher authority.”

“What did you do?”

Anna smiled grimly. “My family worships the old gods.” I shivered at that, a chill dancing across my skin. “I called upon a long-forgotten sisterhood, ancient and hungry. If I could deliver them the guilty parties, they promised they could deliver justice.” Her expression softened as she finally looked at me. “You were never supposed to be there, though. Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry.”

I didn’t tell her it was okay, because it really isn't. But I appreciated her apology nonetheless. I nodded and squeezed her hand again, blinking back tears.

“So...what now?”

“The deed is done.” Anna stood up and dusted the grass off of the back of her leggings. “They’ll have moved on.” Anna looked at me, long and hard, and bit her lip. She nodded to herself, and reached into her purse. “They did ask me to make one last delivery, though.”

Anna pulled out a very familiar piece of black cardstock, embossed with gilded lettering. She handed it to me. I took it with a trembling hand.

“There’s no pressure, and no expiration date,” Anna said. She started to go, but turned back one last time with a sad, sweet smile. “I really am sorry, Lou. For everything. Chel was the best of us.”

I waited until her figure faded into the distance to look down at the paper in my hands. It was a new invitation, to me, this time:

*Louise Teller*  
*True of heart and strong of will,*  
*The Sisters of House Omega invite you into our fold.*  
*A black candle to summon us; a white candle to turn us away.*  
*We will heed your call.*

I thought of Chel, crying and confused, stumbling in a dark basement. I thought of Chel, the last time I’d seen her in life, head thrown back and laughing. I thought of Chel, cold and still in the ground beneath me. I crumpled the invitation in my fist.

It’s quiet tonight; not even a breeze rustles the dying leaves. And yet, a soft wind is disturbing the flame of the black candle I’ve placed in front of my open window. A low, sweet voice floats on the breeze, speaking an old language, and feathers flutter in the dark just past my line of vision.

I was never the type to join a sorority. But I think there might be something to this whole sisterhood thing after all.",Entertainment
nosleep,I was in prison for 15 years. There was a skinwalker in there with us.,"A little background first. I was serving a 15-year sentence in a penitentiary in southern Arizona. What I was in there for isn't important. During my stay there, there were countless things that happened that no one could explain, and even more that no one wanted to know more about. 

It all started with a prison legend. Supposedly, years ago something awful and unexplainable happened in the prison. Every morning we'd be woken up, and expected to stand near the front of our cells while guards visually confirmed we were present and accounted for. Apparently about a year before I got sent there, the most brutal and unexplainable thing happened during one of these routines. A man who had a cell to himself looked very off during this check. When a guard pulled over another guard to help him check it out, they found it wasn't actually the prisoner they were expecting at  all. It was a totally different man. This man, was wearing the skin of the other man over him. Loosely fitting, draped over him, apparently looked like a real monster. The scariest things were though, was the guy wearing the skin was NOT an inmate. They had no idea how he even got into prison, let alone a cell. Whats worse is that they couldn't even figure out who the hell he was. He wasn't documented anywhere. And whats worse than that? They never even found the body of the man of the skin he was wearing.

Pretty grisely stuff, I know. And I realize that's not the go-to definition of a skinwalker, but that's what the prison called him. The Skinwalker. Didn't help that the guy never talked apparently. Anyway, thats what started the whole skinwalker superstition around the yard. Apparently the guy got shipped to a different spot about a month after it happened, and just about everyone in genpop felt all the better for it. I heard about the story on the second day of my stay. Hell of a story to hear to place in your home for the forseeable future.

Now onto the real shit though. Sure, that guy was The Skinwalker, but all he did in the long run was get an old lifer Navajo inmate to tell everyone about actual skinwalkers. It seemed like a lot of the prison culture actually revolved around them. 

Now, apparently, skinwalkers are tricky to point out on the spot, but if you manage to survive around one for more than a minute or two, almost everyone can tell the mannerisms are all off. They can mimic human speech but not replicate it. They twitch manically. They have an unnatural gait while walking. But apparently they got better with experience. The old Navajo guy - his name was Carl - said that he was sure there was an actual one among the prisoners. Slowly picking us off over the years. He called it ""The Grandmaster Skinwalker"" at one point. Apparently he thought it had human mannerisms down so well that you might not even be able to tell if it was your cellmate for a day or two. It had to be good he posited one night. He would expect a skinwalker to jump at any opprtunity for a kill. But this one realized it had a revolving door of people to kill coming to it, and masterfully bided its time, as Carl thought, for years.

A lot of guys found humor in it. A lot more were really on edge about it. Every once in a while in prison, people snap. Sometimes you'll find your cellmate swinging in front of your bunk, strung up around the neck by his pant leg. Sometimes you just can't take it anymore. But in our yard, people tended to snap in a very special way. It wouldn't be an outburst at dinner, or a silent suicide in the night. Guys would just stop talking. Hunch over and shuffle around. Any friendships they had would be mostly out the window. They would turn into a loner during rec time, they would let their hair hang in front if their face. 

No one liked to talk about it. Like if they did, it would happen to them next. I felt the same way. I didn't know if it was a skinwalker, or just people going crazy. But I didn't want to find out. It wasn't clockwork or anything, but every time someone snapped in this way, it wasn't more than a couple weeks before they were ""shipped off"" or ""transferred"" to God knows where without anyone else knowing beforehand.

Then there was the nighttime occurances. Short, loud bursts of sound echoed through my cell block during all hours of the night on a regular basis. It sounded like a mix between a pigs dying squeels and nails on a chalkboard. Just another thing no one liked to talk about. Even scarier were the shadows and footsteps. The block was dimly illumanted in the night by a few lights hanging from the ceiling outside the cells. I myself saw shadows flit across my walls on a regular occasion, when there were definitely no guards near my cell. One time near the end of my sentence, I woke up, looked at my back wall and found a perfect silohuette of a person standing there, but when I looked, my bunkmate was asleep, and no one was outside my cell.

And the footsteps. Everyone hated the fuckin footsteps. They were the scariest part. In the night, sometimes, more rarely than the shadows, you would hear ungodly fast footsteps. They sounded like wet feet slapping on tile floor. Whatver caused them would fly from one end of the block to the other in a dead sprint. Whatever it was, it was inhumanely fast. If you happened to be awake before it started, by the time you heard the footsteps on one side of your cell and whipped your head around to see the thing run by, it sounded like it was 3 cells past you. Everyone hated the footsteps. I agreed, I thought they were the worst.

I was released from that place about a month ago, and I have more stories than I can count. I swear it was nearly my turn. About a week before I was discharged, my cellmate, and a good friend of mine ""snapped"". In the same kinda way. I didn't sleep for an entire week. Well I did sleep of course but never for more than a few minutes at a time. Never turned my back on the guy. The scariest thing? I woke up one night to him somehow snaking his body through the bars of our cell. For reference, I couldn't get anything past my shoulder through them. The worst part though, he was coming back in to our cell. 

On the day of my release I didn't say a word to him. Just left. He seemed fine with it, so, so was I. I had made it through, 15 years of prison fights, gang disputes and for all I know, skinwalker abductions. I left through the front gates, a free man. As I walked along the fence for the rec yard, I spotted my cellmate, standing off on his own, like he had for the last week or so. I shook my head, not even really sure if it was him anymore. I took one last look over the yard, this time from the other side of the fence. I wish I hadn't.

There, standing off on his own, on the other side of the yard, was Carl. Slouched over, eyeing the other inmates, and twitching manically.",Entertainment
nosleep,I saw something on the evening news that I can't explain,"My work friends and I were out at our favourite pub last night. Not a really fancy place but, you know, cheap beer and close enough to home that I don't have to drive. The night started out normally enough, the four of us crammed into a small table off in the corner, mostly talking shop and shitting on our boss. Being this was the middle of the week there weren't too many other people around, maybe around eight or nine others in the whole place. Everybody just kinda keeping to themselves, sorta people you'd expect to see in a pub on a Wednesday.

Anyway, from where I'm sitting I have a pretty good view of the TV behind the bar. Jessie the bartender is kinda lazily flipping through channels and passes by our local news channel. There's a brief burst of orange and red on the screen which I register as a fire happening somewhere, which then disappears as Jessie switches over to the next channel. Something about the image looks oddly familiar though.

""Hey Jess, can you switch that back?"" I call out to her.

The news comes back on, and suddenly I recognize the building in the frame. It's *my* building, and it's burning.

""Holy shit,"" I say, loudly enough that a few people follow my gaze to the television. ""That's my apartment!""

The crowd in the bar falls kinda quiet, everybody staring up at the screen now. The screen shows a wide shot of the outside of my building. The camera must be set up on the north end of the block because I recognize a lot of shops on the ground floor - property management, dry cleaner, convenience mart, etc. The top left corner of the building is aflame. It's not a huge fire by any means, but it looks like a few units between the top four floors or so have already been engulfed by the flames. 

""Jesus, man,"" one of my coworkers says. ""That, uh...that sucks."" There's an uncomfortable murmur of agreement that passes around the table. I mean, I don't blame them, I wouldn't know what to say in this situation either. ""Yup,"" I agree, just as awkwardly. Thankfully, my apartment is only about half way up and located on the west side of the building. I  cross my fingers, hoping my stuff will be okay.

The camera cuts to a reporter on the scene. He's standing a little further away; looking at the shops in the background I can tell he's across the street on the north-west corner of the building. ""Fire fighters are expected on the scene any moment,"" he's saying, ""and hopefully they'll be able to contain this horrible inferno before it spreads any further. As I was saying before, it's very fortunate that everyone was able to evacuate the building before things got too bad, or who knows what tragic events may have unfolded.""

""He's really laying it on thick,"" my other coworkers jokes. I chuckle a bit. All things considered, at the moment it really didn't seem all that bad.

But then, a few moments later: ""Uh...hang on,"" the reporter on TV says, ""We're getting some updated information. It seems...hang on one moment, while we readjust the camera."" The previously locked down camera starts to shift, the angle focusing on an area of the building about half way up the west side. All the lights in the building are out except for one. I feel a weird creeping sensation as I start counting the windows from the bottom.

Five up, two over. That's my place. *I swore I turned that light out,* I think at first. Then I see it.

There's a...person, standing in my window. The camera is zoomed out too far to make out any features, but it definitely looks like a man and it's definitely standing in my apartment. I watch petrified as the camera zooms in closer, the reporter babbling on about ""the overlooked, ill fated soul still trapped in the blazing such and such."" As the image gets closer, I start to make out more details.

The person is...dancing. Or something. I don't really know how to describe it, but he's moving around a lot, and everything he's doing has this bizarre rhythmic quality to it. He starts waving his arms in the air, back and forth, back and forth, and then he's waving them up and down at his sides. Then he's banging both fists on the glass. Then he's waving his arms over his head again, back and forth. Everything he's doing is to the exact same tempo. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. He starts jumping up and down, waving his arms over his head like he's trying to get someone's attention from a long distance, but everything is to the exact same rhythm. Over and over again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

""What in the fuck,"" I say, my voice a hoarse whisper. And then the camera gets a little closer, and finally we can make out the person's features. 

It looks almost exactly like me. It's wearing the exact same clothes that I'm wearing now, clothes I changed into moments before leaving the apartment earlier. Its face looks almost exactly like mine as well, except for its eyes. Its eyes are far too big for a normal person. It also has this almost comical look of horror on its face...I don't even know how to describe it. Imagine if someone were pretending to look scared, but as a joke. It would have almost seemed funny if the circumstances were different, but instead it was just extremely unnerving.

No one in the bar is talking now. Everyone is fixed on the TV. The ""person"" is still swaying and waving around, beating its hands on the glass or jumping in circles. I almost don't hear the reporter mention the fact that firefighters have rushed into the building and are now heading for my floor. *Oh god,* I think, without really understanding what was happening. *Please don't go in there.*

I stare transfixed at the screen. From this angle you can just barely see the top of my front door through the window, not too far behind where this creature is flailing around. Right now it is holding it's face in his hands and shaking it's head from side to side as if saying no. Suddenly the door behind it bursts open as, presumably, the firefighters have entered my apartment. 

The creature stops moving. For a second, I see its expression change. The comical look of horror is gone, replaced by a huge smile filled with enormous, pointed teeth. Then the lights go out.

We all just sat there, staring at the screen as the camera slowly zoomed out from the now dark window. No one says anything as we all quietly pay our bill and leave. I went directly to my sister's place across town and asked to stay with her. I told her there was a fire at my apartment and that's it. When I tried to find footage from the news online later that night, it seemed like they had edited that last part out.

I don't know if any of you on this subreddit know what that thing was, but I hope they didn't put out that fire. I hope they let the whole fucking place burn to the ground.",Entertainment
nosleep,"Forever, A Drug","“Want to get high tonight?”

Scott was bordering on junkie status, and I was always wary about spending time with him, normally in the filthy apartment of some dealer friend while he shot up. It seemed like he was bordering on a collapse, and I was scared of doing the same.

“I don’t know, what are you thinking?”

On the other hand, I had been despondent since breaking up with Ruth. Maybe something to take my mind off the pain would help. I knew she was better off without me, I was just holding her back.

“Meet me at Jared’s, he said he wants to try something new.”

This made me feel a little better. Jared was probably the nicest dealer Scott knew, and his stuff was generally sourced well, plus his apartment was at least somewhat clean.

“You know I don’t fuck with needles.”

“Yeah man, it’s fine, nothing like that.”

I showed up at 8 with three beers in my system that had failed to calm the nervous energy I was feeling. Whatever, it’s fine. It’s going to be fine.

Jared was happy to see me and poured me a whiskey. I felt a little weird and sat down at the table.

He put three black pills down in front of us. “I got this from a trusted contact overseas” he began, “said it’s like nothing else.” He smiled, “Thought the three of us could test drive it before I put in an order, see if it’s really worth it. Stuff is called ‘forever.’”

Scott laughed and downed a pill. Jared and I followed suit. I sat down and stared at the tv, waiting for it to kick in.

It was fine. I felt really mellow, and sort of like the room, and me with it, was stretching in a weird way. We all wound up falling asleep. I woke up the next day feeling fine, and we parted ways. No big deal, certainly nothing life changing.

Years passed. I never left town, never really did anything. Could never kick smoking cigarettes either. Wasn’t a surprise when the doc told me the blood I was coughing up was cancer. Shit. Too late to do anything. I was alone when I took my last breath.

I woke up back in Jared’s apartment, sun streaming through the window.

What the fuck.

I hallucinated an entire, sad life? What was that drug? I mumbled something at Jared and Scott and walked outside. What a weird dream.

I decided I could do more, maybe that was a wake-up call. Applied to a job I didn’t think I was qualified for and got it. Stopped screwing around. Quit smoking, married a nice girl. Had a kid who loved to play ball outside. He didn’t even see the truck coming the day he chased his ball into the street, but I did. Probably never moved that fast in my life. Fast enough to push him out of the way. Not fast enough to get myself out of the way. Oh well, what a way to go, protecting someone you love.

I woke up in Jared’s apartment.

Fuck me.

What the hell was happening? I had to short circuit this, I must still be tripping. I decided to throw myself off the bridge down the street. When I got there, I found I physically couldn’t do it. Something stopped me. So killing myself was out. I had to go home and figure this out.

I wasn’t paying attention as I walked up the stairs of to my apartment, if I had I would have noticed the neighbor’s kid had left a toy car on one of them. When I slipped and tumbled I knew it was going to be bad.

I woke up in Jared’s apartment.

Maybe this could be fun? However long this lasts, I can do anything and it’s not real? Like lucid dreaming but it lasts for decades?

I tried a life of crime. Got shot coming out of an electronics store. Not cut out for that, it hurt like hell.

Screwed around, partied too much, overdosed, back to Jared’s when it all goes to hell.

I had lived ten or twelve lifetimes when I saw her, Ruth. It might seem weird to have forgotten her, but you have to remember we had broken up probably 300 years before. She was older, divorced, sad. She married the wrong guy after our breakup, got abused for years.

I was so depressed after our talk I just walked for hours thinking about how sad her life had turned out, I had thought I was helping her. Found myself in a rough neighborhood, when I got jumped I didn’t hand over my wallet. That was a mistake.

I woke up in Jared’s apartment.

This time I could fix it. I bought a bunch of flowers and went to Ruth’s. She took me back. We got married, had a family. We traveled the word, best friends. It was incredible. The best life I ever had. I died a happy old man, surrounded by family.

I woke up in Jared’s apartment.

I bought a bunch of flowers and went to Ruth’s. If I’m stuck in this groundhog day shit, I know what to do. You know what isn’t boring? Living the best goddamn life you can. Twice. Three times. Ten times. The rough edges get smoothed away. You learn when bad news is coming, when you need to sidestep a bad argument. Just absolute happiness. If you get to choose happiness you choose it, every damn time.

Then one day we were in Paris, celebrating our 30th anniversary. I’d taken this trip with her 20 times. She walked down to the café to get me some breakfast. A car jumped the sidewalk and killed her. That had never happened before.

The next lifetime was worse. We made it 12 years after our wedding before she got some weird flu variant and died.

The next one she was diagnosed with cancer a year after marriage, we never had kids.

The next one her building had burned down the night I spent at Jared's. I stood outside with flowers in my hand, staring at the smoking ruins.

A filthy old homeless man walked up next to me as I stared in disbelief. “Thought you could cheat it did you?” he said. “Thought he wouldn’t notice? But he did.” He started laughing as he walked away. “But he did.” I watched him as he walked away, he turned back from time to time to smile at me.

My lives turned dark. Friends were killed in horrible accidents. Serial killers struck peaceful towns and ravaged the families of those I loved. Overdose, disease, murder, death. Everything was wrong.

The world turned too. Dictators came to power. Wars broke out. Hatred rose. Cities burned. Countries shattered. The world bled.

The old man would appear from time to time, though centuries would sometimes pass between sightings. He always laughed at me, told me that “he” had me now. Always smiled at me.

I drifted, from one dying port town to the next, finding work where I could, drinking away  shitty lifetime after shitty lifetime.

I was sitting in a bar in the capital of East Scotland, watching some cable news about a genocide in some country that hadn’t even existed in most of my lifetimes.

The bartender laughed and I looked at him clearly for the first time. It was the old man. He smiled at me.

“Who the fuck are you?” I growled.

“I’ve seen him longer than you, he sees you now.” He laughed again.

“Where do I go to find him?”

He laughed. “Go to Samar in the Philippines. Not now, in your your next life, when you are still young. Find Biringan. He waits for you there.”

He smiled at me, and I stumbled for the door. I lived another dozen years before a boat I was on went down in a storm.

I woke up in Jared’s apartment. This time, I immediately started looking for a way to get to the Philippines. I sold my car and walked to work for six months, eating the cheapest food I could find.

I arrived confused. Turns out Biringan isn’t a real place. Or maybe it is. I found work under the table, making money however I could. I asked about the invisible city of local folklore. I asked questions about the lore behind it, I learned how many people who have seen it are victims of demonic possession.

I searched for it, every chance I got. Years passed by, I lived an invisible life, like the invisible city I sought. The world rotted away, but I still searched.

One night I was walking home and a car stopped next to me. I heard a familiar laugh through the window. I looked in and saw the old man. He smiled at me. I got in the car.

We drove for hours. The gas gauge never moved. Finally in the distance I saw a gleaming city of light. He pulled over and gestured.

“You have to walk from here, he is waiting for you in the center of the city.” He smiled.

I got out and walked. It felt like I walked for days but the sun never came up, and I never grew thirsty. I walked into a gleaming, deserted city. I felt drawn to a giant tower in the center of the city. It glowed with a light, despite having no windows or obvious source of illumination.

I was not surprised to find a single door at the bottom of the tower.

I entered and began to climb. As I went I heard a voice, deep and old. I couldn’t make out the words. I climbed forever, finally reaching a door. I opened it and stepped inside, facing a giant black abyss.

The voice was everywhere now. Every word ripped me apart.

“I watched you cheat me. Did you think you could live your lies forever?”

I screamed.

“You’re with me now. Forever. I destroyed this world.”

The abyss closed and I realized I was staring at a giant mouth. It opened again. I thought of Ruth. The world went black.

I woke up in the hospital.

Scott jumped up from the chair in the corner. “Oh dude I’m so glad you’re awake.”

“What happened?”

He looked over his shoulder. “We were just about to take those pills and you threw up all over them and then collapsed. You had a crazy fever.”

I looked around. “How long have I been out?”

“Four days. Ruth keeps chasing me out of here, thinks I did this,” he glanced at his shoes, “nurses don’t like me much either.”

“Why is Ruth here?”

“She’s your emergency contact dude, hasn’t left your side even to go home and sleep, she’s just getting coffee now.” He paused and shifted awkwardly. “Do you have any cash? Jared is kind of pissed you puked on his stuff.”

I heard an excited shriek and barely managed to turn my head as Ruth launched herself at me.

I was in the hospital for another four days before getting discharged. Doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, said it must have been a freak infection.

Getting discharged was great. Ruth was picking me up and bringing me to Scott’s so I could go with him to his first NA meeting. Seeing me almost die scared him and he was trying to straighten himself out. Then Ruth and I had a special date planned, things were getting figured out, we were thrilled for another chance.

I walked out to the curb and waited for Ruth to pull her car around. I stood there in the sunlight, feeling alive for the first time in, I guess, millennia.

A nurse rolled another patient in a wheelchair out to the curb, locked his wheel, and walked outside. I felt the breeze on my face and smiled.

The old man in the wheelchair laughed. I stared at him and he winked. “He let you go, make sure he doesn’t get his teeth into you again.” Then he smiled at me.

This time I smiled back.

nosleep,The Climb,"“I want you to kill her,” the voice echoed. Low, monotonic, unwavering. 

In front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. 

Her eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. 

Her mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas.

“This is hardly an existence,” the voice licked.

I surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above.

About five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. 

“What are you waiting for? As if you care,” the voice prompted.

Who was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket.

In one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t like being lost. 

I felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. 

I needed to get out of here. 

“End her.”

My gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. 

A knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. 

An arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy.

I reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother’s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. 

My mother always knew what was going on. 

With the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. 

And through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. 

I held up my left hand to coddle my mother’s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. 

And as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I’d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. 

Because it didn’t matter how bad anything got. It didn’t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. 

My mother was just happy I was there. 

I steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. 

The first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. 

I exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother’s eyes. 

“M-Mum?”

But as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. 

“Climb.”

I peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. 

And as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. 

“I love you.”

“I love you too, mum.”

I never said that enough.

Then, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. 

I climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. 

I cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. 

I reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. 

I climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. 

And as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. 

I could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. 

As I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. 

The light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. 

Urgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze.

“Are you alright in there? Your sister called. We’re worried about you.”

It was my mother’s voice.

I got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. 

She held me in her arms and we sobbed. 

“I wouldn’t know how to live without you,” she whimpered.

When I saw her out the window, garden shears being gripped by both hands and a maniacal expression on her face, I just stood still. 

I was frozen to the spot in shock. I felt no pain at all from the burn on my face, everything was numb. The relief of eradicating the imposter neighbours and the joy at finding a friend in Derek was hacked away in an instant. Just like every leaf from my shrubs. Why would she do this? What had I ever done to her? 

Every question possible crossed my mind. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside me, everything about this place just threw up question after question and for every answer I got, there were ten new questions waiting to be asked. At that moment in time though, only one was truly important. 

How did Prudence know? 

I thought about Terri and her telephone conversations. I didn’t want to think that the sweet lady I thought Terri had turned out to be would do that, but it did cross my mind. I thought of Ian the postman, I’d had bad vibes from him for a while, maybe he’d seen Derek coming up the stairs while on his rounds that morning.

I stood there frozen pondering all these things until I saw Prudence collapse onto the memorial bench sobbing, head in her hands. She was surrounded by the remains of my attempt at a garden with the shears laid out on the floor. 

The stairs were kind to me on the way down, it took 4 flights to make it to the bottom. I ran down the corridor and out the back entrance of the block, no idea what I was going to say. 

“Prudence!” Was all I could manage. Nice one, Kat.

She sat bolt upright before turning and standing quicker than I thought it possible for an old lady. 

“You evil, stupid little girl! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” She screamed, so much animation in her face that the spaces between her wrinkles pulsated like veins on an angry weightlifter. 

“Me?! You think I’m evil! You left that shitty note hidden, missing everything I need to know and got my boyfriend killed! And what you’re doing to your own -“ I screamed, tears beginning to roll, before she interrupted me. 

“Don’t you dare talk about her!” Her voice cracked and she broke down again, this time falling to her knees, twigs and leaves sticking to the bottom of her dress. 

I didn’t know what else to do. So I sat down on the floor. I knew that it was probably a bad idea, this woman couldn’t be trusted and I hadn’t forgotten that, but seeing an old lady crying on the cement floor still made me feel awful.

“How did you know about the garden?” I asked her calmly, trying to change my approach. 

She shoved a crumpled up piece of paper into my hand, she didn’t look at me, her eyes remained on the floor. 

*Dear Prudence,*

*I couldn’t exist knowing what I’d done.*

*I should never have told you about it.*

*The last two won’t grow stronger, she was never theirs to begin with. But I have to end her suffering.*

*I’m sorry.*

*Derek*

I knew what he had done as soon as I finished the note. Lyla, or what was left of her, was gone for good. Of all the creatures only Jamie’s killers from the lift remained. That’s how Derek had spent the few hours I’d slept between our encounters. 

“This is all your fault.” She sniffed. “My whole family are gone because of you.”

That hurt a lot. I trembled as I tried to speak but I always really hated confrontation and I could feel myself starting to glitch. 

“H..how can you say that! I saw... her and she was trapped in a tiny cage eating dog food and small animals. Your family died in that lift. Just like my Jamie.” I may have struggled to get my words out, but I wasn’t about to let Prudence Hemmings blame me for her decisions. Lyla was better off dead than what she was, however awful that may sound. 

“What happened to your face?” Prudence growled at me. “Take you to visit floor number 9? He did this to her in the first place, not me! And now he’s disfigured you!” She was spinning things. I could feel throbbing as she mentioned my face, I really should have had medical attention. 

“This isn’t his fault! You messed him up and he did that to her because of you! You told me that yourself.” I tried ferociously to defend Derek but something inside me still felt uncomfortable about what he had done. I couldn’t help it, Lyla was an innocent little girl who shouldn’t have been punished for Prue’s mistakes. This whole thing was such a mess.

“I was grieving! And then I had her back for all those years, and then I lost Bernie, and then my home and now I have to grieve for her all over again.” Prudence continued to cry, but softer. I looked around at the chaos she created and up at the block my boyfriend had died in and rolled my eyes in disbelief that she could be so selfish. She continued.

“Let me tell you about Lyla. She was a beautiful little girl. As I mentioned before, I have two other older children, they’ve had many other grandchildren, however I hadn’t spoken to my eldest two in years even before what happened with Lyla. 

“Lyla was my first opportunity to get to know one of my grandchildren. Bernie adored her too, always reading her stories and sneaking her sweets. 

“I begged my son to allow her to stay. My children were all incredibly ungrateful, they had it easy growing up and still resented me. I gave them a good, strict upbringing but they didn’t appreciate it. They said I was a cruel mother. Lyla’s dad was the only one I spoke to, but our relationship still wasn’t that of a typical loving mother and son. But she was a second chance. 

“It was a miracle when he agreed. I was more shocked he had convinced his wife to allow it. That awful harlot of a woman never liked me, although I didn’t like her either. 

“They refused to speak to me after everything, I haven’t heard from them since. They had more grandchildren I’ll never meet. I knew at the time my relationships with any of my children were over for good. So when Derek gave me a solution I took it.

“I wasn’t entirely truthful when we first spoke. I said I hadn’t wanted this, but I was desperate. There was never a way to bring her back safely. Derek explained what she would become to me. He was initially trying to put me off even trying to get her back. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. 

But I couldn’t pass up the idea of my beautiful little Lyla, needing her grandma forever. I suppose I was too ashamed to admit it before. But why should I be ashamed?

“My altercation with Derek happened after she was back, when he tried to kill her the first time. Spouting the same things on that note, what kind of monster wants to kill a little girl? That’s why I trashed the garden. He said he wasn’t coping with the news of the new block when he suggested it, that he shouldn’t have told me it was even possible and she had to die. I hid her until the bulldozers came in. 

“When he disappeared I thought I was safe to spend the rest of my life with her. 

“Bernie hated me. Spending time with Lyla was all I lived for, I grew to love her how she was.”

I felt sick. Listening to Prudence talk bought up so many repressed feelings about Jamie. I hadn’t had time to grieve or process anything, I missed him terribly. My old life and my old future felt a million miles away.

I was relieved to know that Derek hadn’t tricked Prudence, or even intended to create rat-Lyla. He was truly good.

“But she didn’t get to have a life. You lived for her but she wasn’t really living. How could a sane person do that to their own flesh and blood?” I retorted.

“You have no idea. This place can make you do irrational things! But she had a life! She had me. It’s all she needed.” She was certainly right about the building and irrational actions, the pain intensifying on my face throbbed in agreement. But I was still convinced she had lost it Dr Frankenstein style where rat-Lyla was concerned. 

She had stopped crying. Her rage levels were rising again. I tried to tell her that it wasn’t really the child she’d known, but she seemed to have grown an entirely new attachment to the creature that replaced what she lost. 

Every rational argument I gave was met with increasing levels of screaming. She got less coherent as she went on. The argument was going nowhere, we went back and forth for what felt like forever.

After a while she started to get closer to me. We had both stood up by this point and despite her haggard and frail appearance, Prudence was truly frightening. She looked unhinged. 

Her words were no longer going in, I was overwhelmed and had too many thoughts rushing through my mind to process her ranting. I took a few steps back clearing a small distance between us. 

By this point, out of the corner of my eye, I could see neighbours in windows of the block, watching the altercation outside, Prue’s screaming had bought a lot of attention. It was bright and I couldn’t see well but I turned to scan the windows and did recognise Eddie and Ellie watching from their bedroom, trying to wave at me. 

They frantically waved and pointed, I tried waving back and gesturing to them, but they kept pointing at me.... why were they pointing?

Then I heard it, the garden shears scraping against the ground as Prudence picked them up and charged towards me. “You ignorant little bitch! You aren’t even listening. You’re don’t deserve my home! You killed her!”

The twins had been telling me to turn around, I shouldn’t have taken my eyes off her. 

Luckily, unlike my earlier shock when I had first seen her, I didn’t freeze. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran faster than I ever have before. I burst back into the building and heard neighbours on the bottom floor lock their doors in a symphony of bolts clicking. 

I couldn’t blame them. Prudence wasn’t far behind me and I wouldn’t want to take her on in her current state if given a choice. But it didn’t stop me pounding on their doors begging someone to call the police, although something told me that in this building that wasn’t going to happen. I ran up the stairs, still being followed by her. 

By the second floor most were still locked but a few had come out of their homes, armed with a variety of heavy objects. Even in a crisis, I couldn’t fault the community spirit here. I ran another flight of stairs that became two but still lead me to floor 3 and then to the back of the corridor. I pounded on Terri’s door.

My heart was racing but when I turned Prue was nowhere to be seen. I was hoping the people who came out on floor 2 had stopped her but something was odd. I hadn’t heard any commotion. This wasn’t the end of it.

Eddie and Ellie hugged me tight as Terri let me in and bolted the door shut quickly behind me. I told her about what had happened. She couldn’t believe what Prue had done. It turned out no one knew about Lyla. 

I was edgy for the first hour. But Prue had disappeared. Terri helped to clean up my burn and put some cold compress on it. She offered to take me to the hospital, but I couldn’t. 

I was too shaken up from what had just happened, I couldn’t face trying to explain how I’d sustained my injuries and I still hadn’t reported Jamie missing. He still hadn’t had any messages from his family, and work had given up calling, but his friends had started. They were harassing me non stop but I had been too distracted to come up with a decent lie.

It had been a week since I moved in and it wouldn’t be long until people realised something was seriously wrong. My conversations with my family had been short, with me insisting they didn’t visit until we were “unpacked and set up”. 

On top of a murderous old lady and an untold amount of abnormal issues the real world problems were starting to creep up on me. 

I sat with Terri for hours, drinking tea and chatting to her. It started to get dark and Eddie and Ellie came into the living room after playing in their room for a while. The voids replaced the big, brown puppy dog eyes again and their claws looked especially sharp, but to me they were still adorable. 

Their transformation prompted me to head back to my flat, it was late. I needed to work out what to do next and how to dig myself out of this giant hole. I couldn’t just keep planting gardens. I needed to do this myself. 

I wandered up the stairs, they went on for a while, but nothing too horrific. I passed the man on floor 5, nodding politely and continuing my ascent. I wondered if he’d received the letter of concern yet, he was a little unsettling. 

When I got to my floor Mr Prentice was making his animal noises again. I smiled, which hurt my face. After all the madness I was starting to find the seemingly benign horrors of this building oddly comforting. 

I reached my flat and turned the key in the door before bolting myself in like Terri had. 

I could feel something wasn’t right the moment I entered. The flat was in chaos, which was nothing new because we had only moved in a week ago and I had been too preoccupied to unpack. But things were out of place, the organised chaos wasn’t how I’d left it. 

Then she strolled out of my kitchen. Prudence Hemmings. She was carrying a large carving knife in her left hand this time, she had prepared for her attack. She smiled at me and lifted her right hand, jingling a set of keys that she had entered with. 

I turned to unbolt the door but she grabbed me from behind before I could turn the handle to open it and held the knife to my throat. 

“I will kill you for what you’ve done.” She whispered into my ear. 

Without a second thought I leaned forward just a tad and swung my head back as hard as I could. I couldn’t believe that it worked but I must have broken her nose. Prudence dropped the knife and clutched her face, blood streaming between her fingers. 

I went to grab the knife but she was closer and doing the same thing. I had no other option but to run again. I grabbed the door handle and turned it to exit the flat as she tried to stab me. I was mostly out the door, but her arm was close enough to reach my side, and I felt the knife pierce the side of my torso.

I was in searing pain but I didn’t stop running. As I stepped outside my flat I could still hear Mr Prentice’s noises flooding the entire hallway. It gave me an idea. 

I ran towards his door, Prudence stabbing at me frantically with blood gushing from her nose. A few got me as I stopped outside flat 48, the pain was awful and I could feel myself starting to drift out of consciousness, I was losing a lot of blood. 

I would give my last breath to end Prue. So running on nothing but adrenaline I knocked hard on flat 48, and shouted.

“Mr Prentice, can you help me?”

It was a shot in the dark, I didn’t know what would happen but I had to try something.

She had stopped stabbing at me, she was enjoying watching me bleed out slowly from the wounds she had already inflicted.

I was incredibly weak, and I lost consciousness not long after that, but before I did I heard heavy clunking from the inside of flat 48, chain locks being released and bolts being undone. I watched with blurry vision as a large creature, that I can only describe as a cross between a bull and a wolf, charged out of the flat and trampled the old witch to death. I heard hear bones crunch just as slipped away. 

I woke up in the hospital a day later. My parents were there as were the police, apparently I had been found just outside the tower block with my handbag missing, by a neighbour who had been watching from a window as it happened. 

The police told me that the person had seen the mugging out of their window. They had seen two men approach me and Jamie, splash something in my face, attack us, and when he tried to fight back, they bundled my boyfriend into a car, which the police had been searching for to no avail. He was officially missing. 

I was baffled, but grateful that Jamie’s disappearance wouldn’t be blamed on me. I went along with it and made out that he had ghosted work to enjoy our first week living together. 

I had been stabbed 4 times but thankfully in all the right places, if there is such a thing as the right place to be stabbed. I lost a lot of blood but I was going to be fine. They were all shallow. They assumed my burns were chemical and happened during the mugging too. 

The police promised to keep us updated but they still can’t find the car. They never will. I wish the story the police had been told were true, it left some hope for Jamie. 

My parents weren’t keen on me returning to the flat after what happened, they said the area was too rough, and that I was living proof it wasn’t safe. They offered to collect my stuff for me. I insisted though, told them that I wanted to see how I felt and they couldn’t force me not to.

I was released from the hospital two days after I woke up in there. When I arrived at the flats, it was strange. It felt like home. Despite everything, something about this place drew me to it. 

I took the lift for the first time since Jamie had died. I had to, I wasn’t recovered enough to conquer too many stairs just yet, and I couldn’t guarantee they’d be kind to me. I smiled at the lack of a button 9 and winced at the thought of the creatures. 

As I reached my corridor I saw Mr Prentice walking along with his newspaper and milk in a bag. He turned to me and smiled.

“I wasn’t sure you’d come back. It’s nice to see you’re up and walking.” He made small talk as if I hadn’t seen him literally trample a woman to death a couple of days prior. The whole experience had been so disorienting that I started to wonder if I really had been mugged and had dreamed the note and everything that’s happened since. Then he said something that confirmed everything was real. 

“I never liked that woman. But you’ve got a real friend in the lady downstairs.” He winked at me and turned the key in his door. 

I got into mine and sat down on the second hand sofa. I felt empty but relieved. With Prue and the imposter Qneighbours all gone the only threat left were the creatures in the lift, who were only a threat between 1.11 and 3.33.

Maybe I could start to live a semi peaceful life in this place. 

Terri knocked on the door, my handbag, that I had left at hers before Prue attacked in my flat, on her arm. Mr Prentice was right, she was a good friend. 

I thanked her for what she’d done and for what she’d told the police. She said it was pure luck that she found me, she had been walking up to return the bag and found me and Prue sprawled out on the floor. I asked what happened to Prue’s body and she just pointed in the direction of flat 48. 

“He was eating it.” She said.

It’s been a few days now and I’ve decided to stay. I can’t imagine going back to complete normality after everything I’ve been through and I’ve grown quite attached to some of the buildings quirks. 

I tried replanting the garden with the help of the twins. I ripped a few stitches doing it and Derek never came. I think he’s gone for good.

I’m ready to fully embrace life here. The last few days have been hard but there’s some time to breathe. Along with the time to breathe, came the time to grieve and I’ve been grieving badly for Jamie.  

This leads me to the last thing I have to tell you. 

Last night I laid in bed, plagued with thoughts of Prue and everything that had happened, but what I couldn’t get to leave my mind was how much happiness it bought her to have Lyla back. It infected every part of my thoughts. I know you all warned me not to, but I did it. I repeated the ritual. 

I haven’t caught him yet, but I’ve heard the scratching. [Jamie’s back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h86ihe/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",Entertainment
nosleep,Mr. Lakavote,"I’m not sure if this will help anyone, but if my story saves even one person from the nightmares I now endure, I will consider it a win. I have borrowed a phone that was smuggled in here, and the orderly, that now monitors every move I make will be coming shortly, so I must be brief. 

A few days ago, I was laying in bed scrolling through Reddit, like I always do to make myself sleepy, when I came across this story that sent shivers up my spine. 

After I was done reading, I thought to myself, “wow, that was terrifying,” and then scrolled to the next one. Big mistake. 

Twenty minutes later, I heard a scratching noise coming from my bedroom door and I froze. Confused, as I live alone, I turned on the lamp next to me and looked towards my bedroom door. 
 
*silence.*

After a moment, I decided it was my mind playing tricks on me. After all, I was reading scary stories in the dark. Probably not the best thing to do before bed, but hey, who doesn’t love a good spine-chilling story before they close their eyes. 

I went back to scrolling through r/nosleep when again, I heard a long scratch on the door. I slowly got out of bed and tip-toed over to the noise. Grabbing the door handle, I gently opened it and peeked into my living room, only to find it vacant.

I quietly closed the door and turned to walk back towards my bed, when my closet door flew open! Now, I don’t know about you guys, but when it comes to fight or flight reaction, I seem to choose the option that leaves you frozen in place with your eyes closed. A defense mechanism instilled in me from childhood and stories of the boogeyman. 

After a moment, I decided to open my eyes and cautiously look towards my closet. I physically heard the clock that was placed on my night stand stop ticking, and that’s when I met him. 

He was almost 8 feet tall, standing on long spiny looking legs, with impossibly long arms that seemed to stretch on forever. What I could see of his body looked to be covered in deep dark cracks. He was wearing a long hooded cloak that touched the floor, as black as midnight on a moonless night, that slightly revealed his ruby red eyes. 

Wh- who are you? I said with a shaky voice.

He never physically moved his mouth, but I heard him speak into my soul with the most sinister voice, “I am Mr. Lakavote and I am here to right your wrong.”

Petrified, frozen in place, I tried to ask him what wrong I had done, but before I could finish he was right in front of me. His breath smelled of rotting flesh and death itself as he breathed down my face. 

He reached out and ran his long boney fingers across my cheek, and instantly I knew what he could do. I felt my eyes being ripped from my head and the burning sensation that followed. I began to scream, but no sound came out. I was stuck in my own personal hell as darkness surrounded me. Alone and afraid. I wanted to die. I wanted the agony to end.

Again, I heard his voice as if it were my own thoughts, “I am the keeper of votesss, you know what you did. You will right your wrong or I will take your eyesssss, along with your eternal soul. You have 24 hoursss.” 

Just as fast as he had appeared, Mr. Lakavote had vanished. 

I did not sleep the rest of the night. I had visions of the horror, I had just endured that left me sweating and cold at the same time. Had I dreamt the whole thing? Could my mind even make up something so sinister and evil? And the pain, oh Lord the pain I felt, I have never experienced anything close to that kind of suffering in my entire life.   

The next morning, pacing my apartment, I tried my hardest to think of what I had done wrong. Did I forget to vote in our recent election? Had I missed an employee poll at work? What the hell had I not voted on that was so important that my soul depended on it? 

Trying to clear my head, I decided to open Reddit, as it always seemed to make me feel better and relaxed. While I was scrolling, I passed the story I had read the night before. The one that had made the hair on the back of my neck stand. 

That’s when it clicked. I had scrolled to the next one before I gave that story the upvote it deserved. Instantaneously, I clicked on the up arrow and waited, hoping with every part of my being that, that was the answer. Was I playing a guessing game with my life? 

I waited the whole day, I didn’t eat, I didn’t move, I barely even breathed. I thought about writing to my family and sorting my goodbyes out but, I felt too incredibly empty to conjure up the words. No one would believe me anyways. 

As the sun slowly set, I decided I might as well wait in my room and hope that I had redeemed myself, or possibly chance losing my eyes and my soul. The thought of that alone made me vomit into the trash can next to my bed and tremble violently with deep, petrifying terror. 

When my 24 hour mark finally came, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and waited. Prayed. Begged, that my soul would be saved and all would be forgiven. 

*silence*

Then, I heard the breathing, I smelled the rotting flesh, I felt all the hair on my body raise. When I finally opened my eyes, I felt a chill that froze me to the bone, as if I was sitting inside a freezer meant for the dead. There he was, right in front of me. His eyes had turned to sapphires as he stared into my soul. 

“Don’t let it happen again”, he bellowed in a voice that to this day still haunts my dreams. Then he was gone. 

I know some of you won’t believe me. Hell, I’m not even sure if I believe myself. As the doctor here says, “it’s all in my head”. But, for the love of your eyeballs and your soul... do ***NOT*** forget to vote while you are reading stories on Reddit, or you too will have the “pleasure” of meeting Mr. Lakavote for yourself.

nosleep,"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 2!)","First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3iex1h/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/

So I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I'll address a few things that you guys have brought up:

* There's been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I'm not trying to rip him off in any way, I've got nothing but respect for the guy. He's actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time they aren't solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven't been on many calls like that, but I'll share a few that I've seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.

* There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I'll touch on that briefly here, and I'll also include a story. 
They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse: they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. 
The stairs don't go up infinitely, or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone cut-and-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don't have any pictures, it's never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don't really feel like risking my job over it. I'll try again in the future, but I can't really promise anything.

* A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of this peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I'll try to avoid that in the future.

Alright, on to the new stories:

* As far as missing persons go, I'd say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls; people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn't believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects. We're a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That's what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we *did* find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers.
An older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn't come home when he should have. Apparently he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn't taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn't go with him. I don't ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn't matter. Someone is missing, and it's my job to find them. We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn't long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured, and we need a full team to help get them out safely. 
We meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what's going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there's a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it's just hanging there. There's no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don't see any other signs that he's still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it's obvious no one's in it. We're all just sort of left scratching our heads. We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point there's not much we can do. The guy's wife called us every day for *months*, asking if we'd found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time.
I'm not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy's cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.

* Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn't matter what circumstances they go missing under, it's never easy, and we always, *always* dread the ones we find deceased. It's not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn't be, or couldn't be. I can honestly say I've heard about this kind of thing happening more than I've seen it, but I'll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.
A mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She's watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area either, which is important.
She packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area. Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it's on a *very* clearly established trail. It's almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you're deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out, starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She's screaming his name, and she says at one point she thinks she heard him answer her. Now obviously she can't go blindly running into the woods, she's got the other two kids, so she calls the police and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him.Over the course of this search, which spans *miles*, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can't pick up any scent, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course there's suspicion about the mother for a while, but it's pretty clear that she's completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help.  But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. 
The volunteers keep searching, though, and one day we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we've been looking for. 
I have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I've never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and half-way up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars and sure enough, it's the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid's shirt, so he knows right away that it's the missing boy. That's when he calls it in, and we're dispatched.
It took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing. Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it's hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I'm certain.
Not only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty. So it wasn't as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn't been dead that long. He'd been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he'd only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I've ever been on. 
We found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He'd frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects, and no answers. To date, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.

* One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he'd been last seen. Kid wasn't even aware that he'd wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I'm really not good with kids, and I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. 
As my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It's a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it's easier. We hike out there, it's a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we're walking around the area and she's pointing out places she's found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we're in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there's back roads you can take to get closer if you don't want to hike that far. But we're on state-protected land, which means there can't be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you'll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there's one thing you learn quickly, it's that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn't say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up.
It's a staircase. In the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It's just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it's out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren't carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it's made of. It's almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. 
I stand there, and it's like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I'm seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it's the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles.
'Get used to it, rookie. You're gonna see a lot of them.' I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard.
'I wouldn't do that.' She says. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. 'You're gonna see them all the time, but don't go near them. Don't touch them, don't go up them. Just ignore them.' I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she's looking at me tells me that it's best if I don't. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn't come up again for the rest of my training.
She was right, though. I'd say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they're relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they're twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They're usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they've been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet.
I've tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. 'It's normal. Don't worry about it, they're not a big deal, but don't go close to them or up them.' When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don't really know what else to tell them. I'm really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn't happened yet.

* This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there's a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn't likely that we'd find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me. Most of you who ski or snowboard, or spend any amount of time on a mountain, will probably have guessed too. When snow falls, it doesn't collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that's filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They're called tree wells, and they're not immediately obvious if you don't know what you're looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn't read them, or doesn't take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. 
My best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated. It's called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn't usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal.
What scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn't die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can't even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.

* A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I've ever seen the Goatman while I've been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I've never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole 'black-eyed man' thing, but I didn't see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I'm not sure I'm willing to chalk it up to the Goatman.
We'd gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails, and needed assistance getting back down to the main area.
We hike up to where she's at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she's passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we're getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened. I can't remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:
She'd been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn't quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don't think I could forget it if I tried.
""It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn't see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that's when I fainted."" 
Now, obviously I'm a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting 'meow, meow' at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I'm gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don't see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and I when I head back I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It's almost sunset by this point, and I don't have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow. But as I'm headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn't come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone. As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It's almost like it's coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. 
I didn't get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird. 

So this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I'll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I'm sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!

EDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I'll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I'll include my friend's stories, and I'll see if I can't get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn't sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you're all okay with it, I'll post lots of stories!

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cjintp/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app


When I first saw Natalia all I could picture was Georgia. The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. 

I didn’t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. 

Eddie and Ellie clutched Terri’s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn’t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. 

“Hi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?” She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. “How’s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.”

“Don’t speak about her! She’s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!” I screamed at her, I couldn’t bare looking at her face again. “You don’t scare me with all your freak friends. I’m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!”

Natalia chuckled. I gulped. 

I may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend’s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I’m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. 

But when I said she didn’t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. 

“I know you aren’t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That’s why we’re here.

“My brothers and sisters are not freaks. You’re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.

“That’s why we set the fire, all those years ago.”  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. 

“Those people weren’t disposable...” Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.

“What was that Terri? Did you have something to say.” Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.

“I was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.” Terri said with slightly more confidence. 

None of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. 

“Why would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?” I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn’t let it happen. 

“We were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live” She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. 

“Michaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn’t live the righteous way that we did. He didn’t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. 

“Our group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.” 

Terri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. 

“You were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!” Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn’t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. 

As Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. 

“Don’t insult us. I’m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.” Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.

For the first time since the people had entered Terri’s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.

Terri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.

“Michael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you’re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn’t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.” She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. 

It may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn’t explain their powers. 

“Things went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. 

The group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We’d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn’t need any more attention. 

“Michael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. 

“Michael couldn’t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. 

“As you know, we obliged.” This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. 

“We took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we’d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!

“But then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. 

“I couldn’t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn’t matter how many times we tried. 

“We couldn’t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn’t let us. It didn’t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. 

“We may have been dead but we didn’t disappear. We couldn’t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn’t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. 

“Two months passed and he hadn’t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. 

“*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*”

I gasped. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn’t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.

“The old bat didn’t tell you that then?” She asked, although it wasn’t really a question. “That her stupid husband is the whole reason we’re here!” 

“We started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn’t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. 

“We only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn’t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue’s gone. It’s fair game in here now.”

As Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. 

I didn’t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.

It was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. 

She opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. 

Eddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. 

Shit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. 

“This isn’t over!” She screamed, and I knew that it wasn’t. 

I stayed on Terri’s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.

I didn’t sleep much. Nothing new. 

When I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn’t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn’t skip on my way up. 

I hadn’t checked the time when I left Terri’s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. 

“Hey, love!” He shouted as he noticed me. 

“I need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?” I practically begged him at the doorstep.

I told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn’t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn’t let them in then I’d be fine. 

He looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn’t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn’t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.

I wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.

But if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? 

When he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. 

Prudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn’t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She’s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. 

I wasn’t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn’t going to win. 

I decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn’t need Prue’s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. 

This was war.

nosleep,"We've been locked in our classroom for days, and our teacher is starting to act very strange...","***Day One.***

We had just opened our textbooks to chapter eight when the alarms blared overhead. A red strobing light spun by the door as metal slats slid down the wall to seal us in. 

The others started to stir and panic at their desks. 

“Now, now. Class, I’m sure everything is fine. Probably just a drill.” Mr. Jonas held up his hands in an attempt to soothe the crowd. 

Just as he was about to open his mouth, Evie came over the intercom. 

“Level 3 Contagion located in the south quadrant of campus. Lockdown protocol is now in effect. Isolation protocol is now in effect.” 

“Oh no…” The teacher suddenly looked pale and a little panicked himself. 

\---

***Day Three.***

I slid my rook across the tiled chessboard to overtake Patricia’s bishop. She stuck out her tongue in defiance as I removed it from the board. I smirked and then shoved another saltine cracker in my mouth. 

Mr. Jonas said we shouldn’t be in here much longer. It was probably just taking the CDC a while to quarantine and eradicate the contagion. He said it must be a pretty nasty virus if they are keeping us locked in our classrooms. 

We have enough snacks for another day or so. It’s been difficult to ration properly when all you have are crackers, candy, and canned spray cheese. 

Overall, though, we were keeping our hopes up which was all we could really do. Staying positive, for now. 

\---

***Day Five.*** 

The room was starting to smell foul. We’d designated some buckets in the corner as the bathrooms and they were about half full and beyond putrid. 

We ran out of food last night. My stomach rumbled with hunger, but I did my best to ignore it. I didn’t feel like playing chess or reading anymore, instead I just napped at my desk as much as possible to pass the time. I was hoping at any moment I’d be awoken to the doors opening so that I could go home. I missed my parents. 

Mr. Jonas was losing his composure too. He’d been pretty put together up to this point and ensuring we were all calm. But his eyes looked a little wild now, and he kept pacing the room talking to himself. A few times I heard him cursing under his breath and then reciting prayers. 

I really hope we get out of here soon. 

\---

***Day Eight.***

*Bang…bang…bang*

A pounding sound coming from the other side of the classroom pulled me from my dreams. 

*Bang…bang…bang*

I stayed still to appear asleep but cracked my eyes just enough to watch as the Biology teacher smashed a chair against the steel door over and over again. 

*Bang…bang…bang*

He was really losing it.

“Let us out of here!” Mr. Jonas screamed as he tossed the chair to the side. 

“I cannot do that sir. A Level 3 Contagion has been detected. I have sealed off the affected area, but you must stay isolated for your safety.” The robotic voice hummed over the speakers. 

He screeched profanities at the camera in the corner of the ceiling. 

Some of the other boys were becoming aggressive as well. There had been some fights the last couple of mornings. Also, some hands going where they shouldn’t be going, back behind the fake plants and lab equipment.

It seemed as if we were slowly devolving. Becoming an enclosure of chimpanzees, like one you’d see at the zoo but only hungrier. 

We needed out, or something terrible was going to happen. 

\---

***Day Ten.*** 

We’d been on a diet of tap water for the past five days. I felt dizzy every time I stood from my desk. The room would spin and I’d almost black out. I kept my footing by sheer force of willpower. I had this irrational fear that if I passed out, I’d be eaten by my classmates, like a pack of hyenas on a gazelle. Feasting on my intestines as they spilled across the tiled floor.

It sounded crazy if I said it out loud, but when I looked around the room and saw all the hungry faces, I didn’t think the idea was too farfetched after all. 

Mr. Jonas hasn’t said a word in over twelve hours. He’s just been sitting at his desk, carving something into the surface of it with an exacto knife. 

For the first time today, I had the thought that maybe we weren’t going to make it out of this. Maybe we were all going to die in this classroom. 

I hung my head and cried. 

\---

***Day Thirteen.***

“Mr. Jonas! Mr. Jonas stop!” Micah cried. 

“Don’t you see? We have to do this, we need food. It’s survival 101. When the pack is suffering and food is scarce, they turn on their weakest member. It’s simple biology. Survival of the fittest.” 

Mr. Jonas had his hands around Trevor’s neck, squeezing so hard that the boy’s eyes were about to pop from his skull. 

Trevor struggled beneath him, but he was frail and terribly small for his age. 

Micah grabbed a large beaker from the table and lifted it high over his head. 

“Mr. Jonas stop now! Don’t make me do this!” 

But the teacher was long gone, his eyes gleamed with delight as drool dripped down his chin from salivating at the thought of a meal. 

I jumped to my feet as Micah brought the beaker down as hard as he could onto Mr. Jonas’ head. It shattered to pieces on impact, knocking the teacher out cold. 

I helped Micah push him off Trevor. The poor kid was wheezing and gasping for air as tears streamed down his face. 

“You’re alright, it’s okay, you’re alright.” Micah patted the kid on the back, trying to calm him as he wailed. 

Suddenly there was a scream like a war cry and Mr. Jonas was air born. He leaped across a desk and plowed into Micah. 

They both went sprawling across the tile. Micah resisted him but Mr. Jonas ended up on top and began dropping his elbows viciously on Micah’s face causing blood to spew from his nose and mouth. 

Static filled my mind, I didn’t think, I only reacted. I reached down and picked up a hunk of glass from the broken beaker, grabbed Mr. Jonas shaggy hair and pulled it back to extend his neck. I pulled the glass through the meat of his throat as hard as I could. 

I’d never seen so much blood before. It poured in a waterfall across Micah’s chest. 

Mr. Jonas fell to the side once more, this time never to get up again. 

I stared at my blood-soaked hands. I felt nothing. No remorse, no fear. Only static. 

Suddenly the metal slats retracted into the ceiling and the door swung open. 

“*Lockdown protocol has been lifted. Please continue with your regular schedules. Lockdown protocol has been lifted.”* Her cheery robotic voice seemed so distant and out of place now. 

The other students gathered around me, just staring at the pool of blood. I think it was the hunger talking, but a part of me wanted to know what it tasted like. I think the others did too. 

Thankfully, before that could happen a man in a suit strolled into the classroom. 

“Hello, class.” His perfect teeth gleamed under the LEDs. 

Before we could say anything a team of adults in overalls poured into the room. Some began taking pictures of everything. Others started cleaning up Mr. Jonas. 

One man with gray hair dropped a large box on the teacher’s desk and opened it. He then started throwing fresh fruit and granola bars to each of the students. 

We devoured everything he gave us. I started to feel more like myself after two bananas and four granola bars. They tasted like heaven, a sweet salvation. 

The first man with the nice teeth in the expensive suit waited until we were all done before he addressed us again. 

“I know it’s been a long thirteen days guys, I appreciate you all hanging in there. I’ve alerted each of your parents that you’ve been cleared to go home.”

The classroom erupted in cheers as we all hugged each other. Even Micah, covered in gore, danced around excitedly. 

“You’ll all be able to go home soon but first I just need to do a little debrief with each of you before you go. I’m going to set up in the counselor’s office and Mr. Moses here is going to bring you down one by one to give your account on what happened here during isolation.” 

We all nodded our heads in agreement, anything to get out of here. 

Mr. Moses, the man with the grey hair and the snacks, took us down one by one and we spilled our guts to the man with the nice teeth. 

When I gave my story on what it was like I still felt numb, even when describing how I’d killed Mr. Jonas, I just felt… nothing. 

It wasn’t until I’d gotten home that evening that I’d broken down and wept. Once I was in my mother’s arms I cried and cried until I couldn’t anymore. Then I ate more food than I ever had. I shoveled pasta down my throat until I thought my stomach would burst. 

It was a good feeling. To be full. To be human again. 

\---

Years later while I was at University a whistleblower had leaked that what we’d endured at the school was a government coverup for a top-secret experiment. 

There had been no virus, no contagion. It began as an experiment to test the artificial intelligence system they had at the school. But then it morphed into a social experiment to see how long we would last before someone was murdered or severely harmed. To test the boundaries of civility and moral character under immense pressure. Just in case there was a real issue with the code in the A.I. and this scenario became a reality elsewhere. 

When I’d killed Mr. Jonas, it had ended the experiment. 

The news had made me sick to my stomach, I was angry and disgusted for weeks. 

I was okay with it now though. You see, Trevor may have been small, the weakest member of the pride perhaps, but he was also a genius. With his hacking expertise we were able to locate Mr. Nice Teeth and Mr. Moses. 

It’s been six days so far and every time they scream and hit the door with a chair, I just can’t help but smile. 

It’s a little experiment a few of us are conducting. It’ll end when someone is murdered or severely injured. 

Maybe…",Entertainment
nosleep,They told me I was nothing but a dog,"My father named me Laika because when I was born, my grandfather told him to treat me like a bad dog. To Father, *Laika* was synonymous with *dog*. He used the name to remind me of my place in the hierarchy: lesser. Beneath. Inferior.

Nothing but a dog. 

My father meant to humiliate and degrade me with such a name, but he honored me instead.

You see, Laika was a stray dog from Moscow. On 3 November 1957, the Soviet Union put her on Sputnik 2 and launched her into space. She was the very first animal to orbit Earth.

The Soviets knew how to put a rocket into space, but they didn’t know how to bring it back. This made Laika’s mission a death sentence. Shortly after reaching orbit, the interior of Sputnik 2 became catastrophically hot – far too hot for mammals to tolerate. Mere hours after launch, Laika died an agonizing death. She perished the same way she’d lived: lesser, beneath, inferior. Abandoned. Unloved.

Nothing but a dog.

I spent many hours imagining her terror, pain, and loneliness. How would it feel, spending my last hours hurtling through divine darkness in a metal bucket?

What must it be like to not understand what I was seeing, or why it was suddenly so loud and so hot?

What must it be like to not understand why – after being plucked from cruel streets and dropped into a bustling world of kindness – I was now alone? Perhaps I would think I’d been a bad dog. Perhaps I’d think this was my punishment.

Punishment is my mother tongue. I know what it was like to be punished for transgressions I cannot remember or understand, to be hurt so badly my heart rate triples and my mind flies out the window and soars into the stars, retracing Laika’s doomed flight while my husk squirms and weeps on the floor of a dirty house sixty-eight miles below. 

Even so, I adapted to punishment. As I said, it eventually becomes a language. Given enough time, anyone can learn a language.

What I could not adapt to was fear. 

As a child, I was afraid of everything. You see, in the deepest, most forgotten parts of the world, there are things that most people cannot believe and even fewer would understand. Old ways, old things, old truths. 

And old monsters.

Monsters like my father and my grandfather. 

How can I describe this in a way you will believe? Maybe I can’t. Maybe I shouldn’t try. So instead, I will describe my grandfather.

He was called Paval. By the time I turned nine, he had gone through six bodies. By this, I mean he inhabited them. Using a variant of blood magic perfected by my forebears across many centuries, he leapt from body to body.

He was not a spirit; he had a corporeal body of his own, a twisted, monstrous thing covered in scars and hard, glittering skin, a body that could shrink to the size of a garden snake or expand to the size of a house.

But for all its marvels, this body was weak; sunlight burnt its eyes and blistered its flesh. So it entered other bodies, like a hand inside a puppet, and wore them until they rotted away. I will never forget the sight of him – of many hims – in different bodies as flesh degraded and fell away in wet, discolored strings. Or the way his eyes – hard, round yellow eyes – glinted deep within their stolen sockets.

Grandfather preferred the bodies of men, but sometimes chose women or children. Once, he even wore the body of my mother. I was very young then – perhaps three – and the sight of her familiar form standing before the fire sent me into such transports of joy that I bawled from sheer ecstasy.

Then she turned around, and in her bruised sockets I saw my grandfather’s eyes: flat, glittering yellow. Like rotted gold.

I reared back, screaming.

My father, who had been stroking a pair of old baby shoes, looked at me with contempt so deep it scorched my heart. “Shut up, dog!”

I cringed. This was a mistake; his contempt exploded into disgust. He shot out of his chair and stomped upon me. Dirty, squirmy pain exploded across my abdomen. I hobbled away, whimpering, and hid under the stairs.

I lay there alone for many hours. Eventually my mind left my body and soared into the sky, a reverse dive into a sea of stars. I drifted away, dreaming of diamond-colored constellations and red nebulae. At my side was a curly-tailed dog with a striped face. My namesake. 

Laika.

When I woke, I *felt* her: furry and warm, chest rising and falling under my hand. I opened my eyes. For just an instant I saw her in the shadows. Then she shrank away, sinking into the ground. I tried to grab her, but the floor swallowed her. My fingers closed on cold, hard floorboards. 

I covered my eyes and wept.

Several months later, Grandfather-Within-Mother gave birth to a child. A baby boy with yellow eyes and my father’s curly black hair. Mere minutes after the birth, Father picked up the baby and took him outside. He returned an hour later, empty-handed.

Spurred by horror, I immediately ran out into the night. The cold was brutal, at once invigorating and exhausting. I searched until I found the baby, whimpering weakly beside a snowdrift. He was still covered in birth blood.

I named him Alexander and brought him home.

When I walked in, Father immediately slapped me. I reeled back as stars rocketed across my vision. “Never,” he hissed, contempt dripping from every syllable, “never disobey again. Give him to me now.” He reached for Alexander, but Grandfather stopped him.

I looked up, and swallowed a whimper. Grandfather stared back at me through my mother’s rotting face. The mouth – puffy and discolored, with an oddly detached look – quirked into a smile. “No. Let the dog keep her pup. We have other concerns.” 

They certainly did; they worked together, and they worked constantly. Father kidnapped victims, and Grandfather used them. Whenever Father brought a new victim to the cabin, Grandfather used his hands – long, hideous things marked with scars and covered in strange, glittering flesh – to tear out the victim’s tongue and crush their feet. 

Then he would wait until nightfall – because remember, sunlight burned Grandfather’s eyes and blistered his skin - and carry them to his Chapel.

His Chapel was an ancient stone structure at the base of a wooded hill. Within the chapel were three red windows and six rough-hewn pews. At the end of each pew sat desiccated corpses, facing the altar like sentries.

I hated Grandfather’s chapel; the very air weighed upon me whenever I entered, crushing my heart and poisoning my lungs. The worst part was the fear: electric and paralyzing, inescapable.

Luckily, I was just a dog, and dogs do not spend much time inside chapels. But dogs hear screams. Even screams from far away, echoing down forested mountains long into the night. 

Grandfather did not often leave his Chapel, but when he did it was always in the wee hours of the morning. I know this because my father and I were required to hold vigil until he walked through our door. Whenever Grandfather came back from his Chapel, he looked human again: smooth skin, wide smile, good proportions. Sometimes he looked a bit like Father. Sometimes he looked like his victim.

It was as incomprehensible to me as outer space would have been to Laika. 

The stream of Grandfather’s victims never ended. Vagrants, the elderly, the travelers, orphans fleeing violence. There were so many.

So, so many.

If it weren’t for Alexander, I would have withered into nothing. He was more than a brother to me; for all intents and purposes, he was my son. Neither Father nor Grandfather cared for him. They didn’t even feed or clothe him; I had to feed and dress him with what little I had. 

Despite my best efforts, he never learned to speak. That isn’t to say he couldn’t communicate – he could, with gestures and facial expressions and nonsense syllables – but language eluded him. But it was all right. He grew into a sweet, curious boy with freckles and long, delicate hands. Over time, his terrible yellow eyes mellowed into a clear, bright green. He was my life. He was my heart.

But he wasn’t enough.

One night, as a little girl’s screams came shrieking down the mountain from Grandfather’s Chapel, I finally went to my father.

I lay prostrate at his feet, which is how he taught me to approach him. The wooden floor was rough and painfully cold under my fingers. “Why, Father? Why do you do this?”

He sat in his chair, watching the fire. In his hands he held a pair of white baby shoes. “Because your Grandfather and I must live, little dog.”

“Will I have to do this to live?”

“Yes.”

“Then I don’t want to live.”

“I understand,” he said. His grip tightened on the shoes. “But you don’t have a choice.”

I choked back a sob and waited for the dismissal; I could not come to him without crawling, and I could not leave until he told me so.

Instead, he said, “Stand up, Laika.”

Hearing my name was like being doused in ice water. He never used it; by that point, in fact, I’d almost forgotten I had a name.

“I said, stand up, Laika.”

It was a struggle to obey; fear made my bones rubbery and my muscles weak. 

Father held out the baby shoes. “What do you see?”

“Shoes.” My voice quavered. “Old baby shoes.”

“Those shoes,” Father said, “belonged my sister, Alexandra. I loved her more than anything. More than life. More than my parents. More than your mother. More than you. She was my heart.”

I watched him. The firelight threw his face into relief, creating crevasses out of wrinkles. His curly black hair shifted like smoke, and his long, sharp nose looked strange and monstrous. Paralytic electricity swarmed my skin, so much like the Chapel that I could have wept.

“On my twelfth birthday,” Father said, “your grandfather boiled a pot of oil and called Alexandra to him. She and I were going to pick wildflowers later, so she was dressed in her finest clothes: a blue dress and white shoes. These shoes.” 

Father did not speak for a very long while.

“She was my heart,” he finally repeated. “When my heart broke, I broke. It made me like Grandfather. Someday, I will be just like him. I will live forever. You will, too.” 

That night, I had a nightmare of a little girl with sunken yellow eyes melting into blisters as my mother’s rotted body doused her with boiling oil. 

I woke screaming.

Moonlight streamed through the window, drenching my room in celestial silver. My heart thumped so wildly that I could see my nightshirt moving. It wanted to escape. I wanted it to escape, to, because without it I would die, and when I was dead I could sail the stars with the other Laika.

Small, warm hands touched my face. I turned, expecting Alexander. Instead I saw my nightmare. 

Great inflamed blisters bubbled and burst, sending rivulets of pus down her tiny, raw face. The skin around its mouth had burned away, leaving neat rows of milk teeth fully exposed. Burned scalp and dull bone glinted through black, curly hair. A blue dress clung to her body. Oil dripped from the hem, soaking my blanket.

“Don’t cry,” she whispered.

Alexander stirred between us.

“Get out,” I whispered.

The girl’s blistered chin quivered. “But you made me come here. Please let me sleep.”

“All right,” I whispered, because I did not know what else to say.

The girl burrowed under my blanket. I watched, aghast, as she threw a bony, burnt arm across Alexander and drifted to sleep.  

That night, I did not sail the stars with Laika. Instead I sat awake, watching the apparition with mingled excitement and fear.

Just before dawn, my door creaked open. I tried to shield the girl as my father stepped into the room. 

“What is that?” he asked sharply.

“Please,” I whined. “Please, don’t.”

The girl shifted, and – incredibly – began to shrink. Her body flattened into nothing, leaving her dress crumpled on the floor. That sank away, too, leaving the cold, empty floor in its wake.

“*What was that?*” Father screamed.

“I saw it in my sleep –”

“*Her!*” Father roared. “*Her*, not *it*!”

“I s-saw her in my sleep,” I stammered helplessly. “When I woke, she was here.”

Sweat gleamed on Father’s skin, reminding me of stars. “Get dressed. You must see your grandfather immediately.”

I fell to my hands and knees and crawled to him. 

“No,” he said. “Stand up. Bring the boy.”

Alexander wept angrily when I picked him up. I ignored him and followed Father into the dark forest. The full glory of early spring bathed the landscape: pale beams of light shafted through the canopy, cutting the thick shadows with gold. Vermin crept through the undergrowth, and deer watched from a distance. The forest was always full of animals; Grandfather was no danger to the birds or beasts, after all.

Soon the Chapel came into view: an ancient little church with a black spire, red windows, and frost-encrusted stones. 

Father ushered us inside. The moment I crossed the threshold, my skin began to crawl. Dread and fear swept over me. Alexander burst into tears.

Father shoved me toward the altar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sentry corpses twitching. Chests rose and fell in jagged, senseless rhythms. One especially tall corpse with long copper hair turned as I passed.

I covered Alexander’s eyes and stopped at the altar.

Shadows thickened and writhed against the back wall. Back in the pews, bones clattered and dried joints creaked.

Something blinked in the darkness behind the altar: great, flat eyes like golden moons, shining in the cold shadows. 

Grandfather.

“The dog,” Grandfather intoned, “and her pup.” He snarled: a deep, bone-shaking rumble like that of a tiger. Teeth glinted in the shadows, a shining ivory arc wider than Father’s entire head.

“Paval,” Father said urgently. “She had a nightmare. When she woke, it followed her out of the dream. It came alive. I saw it.”

“Oh,” Grandfather murmured. “*Oh.*”

“Our little dog has talent after all,” said Father.

“All good and well,” said Grandfather, “*if* she loves her pup. Do you love your pup, dog?” He reared up from the shadows, twisted and sinewy and utterly inhuman. “Do you love him? Or do you feel *obligated* to him?”

I opened my mouth to answer. Instead, I burst into tears.

Grandfather laughed, a low roar that shook dust from the rafters overhead. “A weak bitch indeed. Our hope is in the boy, Mikhail. It was always in the boy. That is why we made him. Now go.” Those great yellow eyes flicked to the pews. “I do not like to tempt my sentries. Not when they are hungry as they are.”

Fear and disbelief battled across Father’s weathered face. “Do you not understand what I’ve told you? She creates life from thoughts.”

“A poor substitute for what we require. Leave, Mikhail.”

“But – ”

Grandfather rocketed out of the shadows, a rippling mass of glittering skin and malformed limbs, and knocked Father to the stones.

The corpse-sentries uttered a deep sigh and continued to twitch.

“Never,” Grandfather snarled. Sunlight poured through the crimson windows, imbuing him strange hide with a red glow. He looked like the sky. A starry piece of outer space. “Never defy me.” 

I waited breathlessly for Grandfather’s eyes to burst and his skin to sizzle – he was, after all, exposed to daylight – but it did not.

Many moments later, Grandfather struck Father across the face and whipped back into the darkness.

We left. Father did not speak again until the cottage came into sight. Then he grabbed me and dragged me off the path.

“Listen,” he growled. “Listen well. I can protect you from him. And…” He looked down at Alexander, eyes blazing with disgust. “When the time comes, I can protect you from *him*, too.  But only if you help me.”

“Why should I need protection? He’s small, and loves me as a mother.”

“Do you remember the story of Alexandra?” Father asked.

I nodded.

“Your story is coming. Only Alexander will be me, and you will be Alexandra.”

My heart fell to the cold earth. I carefully pressed Alexander’s head into my shoulder, shielding his face from Father. 

“Listen, dog. When next you dream of my sister –” His voice broke; he pulled away and ran his fingers through his hair. Tears shone in his eyes, which were huge and miserable over his quivering mouth. “When she comes again, bring her to me.”

“All right, Father.” I had never seen him weep before; the sight was frightening and curiously thrilling. “I will.”

Father nodded curtly, then left. I nearly followed, but thought better of it. Instead, I stayed in the forest with Alexander.

As the morning brightened and birdsong swelled to a symphony, I set Alexander upon the narrow path. He ran forward, humming a tune of his own composition. Shadow and sunlight dappled his skin, turning him into a woodland sprite. The trees were in full bloom: petals drifted down like snow, carpeting the earth in glistening white.

Alexander pulled ahead. After a while, I couldn’t hear or see him; he’d drifted away, slipping into the deep shadows.

Panic overtook me. “Alexander! *Alexander!*” I rushed ahead, grimacing against the pain in my chest. My heart thumped wildly, so hard I could see my shirt move; it wanted to escape again. “*Alexander!*”

He darted from between the trees. I halted, overcome with relief so powerful it took my breath away. Petals covered his head and shoulders. As I watched, one drifted down and settled on his nose. Wide green eyes glimmered above it, bright as the promise of spring.

For the first time in my life, my heart was so full that I wept.
 
That night, Alexandra came to me again, blistered flesh dripping down her face. Her eyes had melted away, leaving raw, swollen masses of flesh in her melted sockets.

Remembering my instructions, I sat up. “Father,” I quavered. Alexandra reached for me blindly, ruined hands closing on shadows. “Father!”

Father burst into my room, gasping. “Alexandra!” He shot forward, arms extended as if to sweep her up.

She turned.

Father froze.

Alexandra tottered toward him. “Mikhail,” she whined. “Mikhail, my eyes hurt.”

Father collapsed and covered his eyes as Alexandra approached. She left a trail of pus and oil, shining like a tiny river in the moonlight.

“Mikhail, my hands hurt.”

Father wheezed miserably.

“Mikhail, my skin is on fire and drips away.” She stopped before him and crouched. Father whimpered and whined like a beaten dog, twisting away from her hands. 

She set her small hand on his cheek. Father squalled and writhed, but couldn’t break away from her. “Mikhail,” she wept. “You are just like him now.” She jerked and began to shrink, to sink, disappearing into the floor. The moment her hand fell away, Father leapt to his feet and ran.

After that, he did not ask to see Alexandra.

This is good, because I did not see her in my dreams after that. I only saw Laika. I spent most nights drifting among the stars with that dear, doomed dog at my side. Imagined or not, the sights were glorious: incomprehensibly beautiful star formations, planets, great multicolored expanses of celestial mists.


Sometimes I woke, bleary and incoherent, and felt her fur against my skin. But by the time I opened my eyes, there was nothing.

One winter morning, I woke very early. My stomach growled immediately, and no wonder; Father hadn’t fed me for days. I’d fed Alexander with table scraps and tree bark. 

That, I decided, would change today.

I crept into the kitchen. There wasn’t much; there never was. But I scraped together what little I could, and turned around.

My grandfather sat at the table, great golden eyes shimmering in his terrible face. “Little bitch. What have you done to your father? He no longer hunts. He no longer eats. He no longer obeys.” 

I felt like I was back in his chapel: crushed by darkness, heavy with dread, on the verge of panic.

“Your ability,” said Grandfather, “has not been seen on this earth for a thousand years or more.”

Of course the ability wasn’t of earth; I’d no doubt come across it while sailing through space and breathing stardust. “It’s just nightmares.”

“No. You take the dark things of the world – the fear, the hate, the pain - and channel them into physical form. And that is just the beginning. You will be able to do anything. You will make bodies. Permanent, perfect bodies for me…and for you.”

The relish in his voice made me sick.

He said, “Our women have always been weak and talentless. I thought the same of you, little bitch.”

Tears pricked my eyes and my bones thrummed as if struggling to break through flesh and run away. But it was no use; destiny had already bloomed between my grandfather and I, heavy and foul with the promise of despair. 

Grandfather whispered, “Listen closely, for you will only hear this once: *I was wrong.*”

He left. I ran to the window and watched him hurtle through the trees as sunrise threatened. Back to his Chapel. 

I waited until the sun was up. Then I ran to my room, bundled Alexander in every bit of clothing I could find, and left.

We followed the path for many miles. Our home was hours and hours from the nearest town; we wouldn’t reach it until long past nightfall. I could only hope that Grandfather wouldn’t notice our absence until the following day. It wasn’t an unlikely hope; Grandfather spent most of his time in the Chapel.

The second this thought crossed my mind, a glittering dark shape leapt out of the trees and knocked Alexander from my arms.

I caught a blur of twisted limbs and nightmarish hands, of great yellow eyes like flattened moons. Alexander screamed as a torrent of blood splattered across the snow. It sank quickly, melting red canyons through the pristine white.

Grandfather at me, narrow sides heaving. Then he leaned down and tore out Alexander’s throat.

I screamed. Birds took flight and mammals ran through the undergrowth. The piercing note echoed off the mountains. The pain within it should have ended the world, but there was no one to hear and no one to care.

Grandfather grinned. Alexander’s blood and sinews clung to his teeth.

I broke. 

I felt it; the crushing weight of sorrow, the almost physical sensation of my spirit tearing and bleeding out into my guts.

I fell to my knees and cradled Alexander’s head for hours.

My father finally found us around nightfall. He had a heel of bread and an oily chicken leg. He pressed them both into my hands, then left. 

I tore the bread into pieces and dropped them, one by one, into Alexander’s mouth. When he did not wake, I burst into tears and hurled the chicken leg into the woods.

The moon rose into the cruel, dark sky. Stars glimmered through the bare branches over head, creating a breathtaking fractal pattern.

I flopped down beside Alexander, pulling him to my body. He was cold. Terribly cold. I held him anyway, keeping my eyes trained on the stars. My mind detached with great difficulty, like it was trapped in tar.

Finally, it wrenched itself free and sailed upward, disappearing into a silvery sea of sky and stars, rocketing ever higher until I saw the Earth spinning below.

Laika’s rocket zoomed past. I reached out and caught one of the metal bars near the nose. I could sense Laika within: her terror vibrated through the craft and leached into my bloodstream.

“It’s all right,” I said. “It’s all right, Laika. I’m here. When you land, I will help you out and we will play together.”

Her fear diminished, and so did her pain. So did mine. Together we sailed the stars, looking upon the Earth and marveling at the incomprehensible beauty around us.

I woke cold, sore, and in more pain than I can describe.

I sat up. Alexander’s stiff body broke away from mine. I reached for him blindly. A thin scrim of ice covered his eyes. The wound in his throat was an open horror, one I couldn’t look at for long.

I drew my knees to my chin and wept. 

After a while, something warm bumped my hand. A wet nose touched my palm. I knew what I would see long before I opened my eyes.

Laika’s striped face and dear curly tail made me smile, even through my tears. Stars glimmered through her fur, gently pulsing pinpricks of light.

 “What is this?” Grandfather’s voice echoed through the trees.

Rage flowed through my blood, exquisitely corrosive. Hate, I learned then, is pleasurable; it is fury and it is the basis of power. 

Grandfather erupted from the darkness, scaled skin shimmering like a river under the moon. “You waste your talent,” he sneered, “on a mutt. Not even your own pup! No matter. I will correct you.”

Laika reared up and leapt, snout piercing one of Grandfather’s flat moon eyes. He screamed and shook his head back and forth. Laika fell to the snow, twisting, and quickly righted herself. Then she bit his foot. Her teeth sank through that impenetrable, immortal hide like butter. 

Laika was not large enough or strong enough to kill him, but she tore holes in him the way a match scorches holes in paper. Soon Grandfather was on his knees, mere feet from Alexander’s corpse.

Laika came to me, panting, and collapsed in my lap. She bled from a thousand wounds: some small, some undoubtedly mortal.

“Good dog.” My voice broke. I stroked her gently, willing those wounds to close. I was a monster. I’d used Laika just like the others had; calling her down on false pretenses, filling her with hope, before throwing her into the void. “Good girl. Good, good girl.”

I looked up as Grandfather’s good eye slid to my dead brother. Something dark bloomed there: a wicked, corrupted hope. He curled in on himself, twisted body shrinking to a withered husk, and slid down Alexander’s throat. 

I screamed as Alexander’s body twitched and juddered. Then he sat up, bones creaking and frozen sinews cracking.

He smiled. His eyes shone like molten gold in a forge. 

Laika attacked again. Alexander’s face curled into a snarl as she bit and tore his skin, exhibiting an energy at odds with her awful wounds.

I watched, helpless and hopeless and hurting, wishing I could detach and fly into the stars once more. Except there would be nothing there for me now; I’d called Laika down from the stars and doomed her.

The snow crunched behind me. I whirled around. Father stood there, watching me with contempt. In his hands was a sleek, gleaming shotgun.

Relief and horror engulfed me. This was the end. My mind would detach, forever this time. The fear would finally end.

Laika bit down on Grandfather-within-Alexander, who hit her. She whined, but held fast.

Father stalked past me and cocked the gun.

“No!” I screamed. “Don’t hurt her! *Don’t hurt her!*”

Father pointed the gun at Alexander’s head and fired. Blood and viscera and dark, glittering flesh exploded across the snow.

Father fired again, then reloaded, and fired again and again. Alexander’s head evaporated into red mist. Finally his body lurched, and Grandfather – small, bleeding, scaled Grandfather – slithered out of his throat.

Laika caught and held him. Father pressed the barrel of the gun against his good eye and pulled the trigger as the sun broke over the mountains.

Father stepped back. I reached for him, drunk on hope and gratitude, but he recoiled from me. In his weathered face, I saw despair and rage…

And contempt.

He kept his eyes trained on mine as he placed the gun in his mouth.

“No!” I screamed.

He pulled the trigger. Half his head evaporated, leaving a glistening mass like a fleshy geode. His body stumbled forward a step, then crumpled to the snow. 

It took a very long time for the sun to burn Grandfather down to dirty oil.  Laika held on until the last scrap of skin melted. Then she stumbled to me and collapsed. 

I stroked her until her body shrank and sank into the ground, leaving nothing but a scattering of tiny, dim orbs: the stars I’d seen in her fur. I touched one. It was pleasantly hot. I gathered them up and slipped them into my pocket. I went to Alexander’s body – ravaged beyond description, broken in ways that did not see entirely real – and sat with him until nightfall. Then I stood and walked away.

And life went on.

At first, I brought them back from my nightmares  – Alexander, Father, Grandfather, even Alexandra – but I quickly taught myself to starve and eventually kill my ability. It is not a good power; it is born of rage, despair, selfishness, and fear. 

And I cannot tolerate fear.

Besides, dogs do not have such awful powers. It is good to be a dog, because they are not necromancers. They are not monsters. They are nothing more or less than the simplest and most loving of creatures.

That is why I will always be Laika the dog.

nosleep,The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide. Some people are too good for this world.,"Last time: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ckw07c/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I sat silent for a moment in shock that my plan had even worked. It seemed almost too simple, too easy. But here he was.

Derek had a kindly face, wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks only added to the softness of his expression. His white hair poking out from beneath his flat cap stood out in the dark night.

“That’s a lovely little patch you’ve planted. I can look after it if you like, I used to maintain the last garden here.” He said, breaking the silence that had followed since his initial words. 

“I know who you are. We need you.” Was all I could manage, the mental exhaustion and fatigue from the whole experience had built up, but his arrival was like finishing a bad day working at school. I felt like I could relax again, even if only a little. 

“Whats your name darling?” He asked.

“It’s Kat. I live in flat 42 now.” His face lit up as I confirmed my flat number. 

“Prudence has gone?” He asked.

“She’s gone. But the whole place is a mess, so many things are happening and the residents are suffering.” I answered. 

We chatted for what felt like hours. Outside with nothing but moonlight. He told me how he used to consider the building part of the garden, a place for him to maintain, the residents just like the plants he looks after. 

I explained my whole experience since moving in. I told him about Jamie and I sobbed. Derek held me as I cried and made me feel safe, something I had forgotten the feeling of since receiving Prue’s note. He didn’t interrupt, he just listened.

I told him about Natalia and the cultists, the problems they had been causing. He was particularly heartbroken when he heard that they had used Eddie and Ellie for entry. He had gone before they were born, but remembered Terri as a child and how sweet she was, he was pleased when I told her what a sweet adult she had become. 

My claims that Prudence was the only person who knew how to kill the imposter neighbours were met with a skeptical expression which gave me some hope.

Derek listened to my entire tale with barely a word. When I finished he stood up and asked me to follow him. I was confused, but I did as I was told. 

He walked me to the entrance of the lift. I lifted my arm to check the time on my watch. We had been outside for quite some time and the idea of the creatures being inside made my heart pound and my stomach turn. 

“You are safe. It’s 12.32am, there’s no need to worry or to check your watch.” And with that he pressed the “call lift” button. Despite his insistence that I was safe my stomach continued to do gymnastics.

It felt like forever before the lift finally made the clunking sound that meant it had reached the bottom. I felt my whole body shaking violently as the doors opened, I don’t know what I expected to see, we were in the safe time zone but every time I looked at the life I pictured Jamie’s dead, crunched up body. 

“Step inside.” He said.

“I can’t. Please don’t make me.” I begged

“I won’t let anything happen to you. But you need to see something.” There was such sincerity in his eyes as he spoke. I had never trusted someone so completely so quickly, but every fibre of my being told me this man was entirely good. 

I stepped inside the lift.

Derek stepped in behind me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder as I hyperventilated. He gently turned me to face the panel of buttons that control where the lift stops.

“What is wrong with this panel? Do you see it?” He asked cryptically. 

I studied the panel. Read all the numbers, counting them. I couldn’t see anything wrong. I tried. I really tried, but nothing seemed out of place at all. Everything you expected to find was there and nothing more. I shook my head, barely regaining my composure.

“Can you take us to floor 9 please?” He smiled slightly as he made the request. 

I looked back to the panel to press the button, but floor 9 didn’t exist. I was so confused, I had counted the numbers, I was sure of it. Derek must have made it disappear. But the panel didn’t look any different to before. I can’t explain it, looking at it, I would have sworn blind nothing was wrong with it even once I knew, but floor 9 didn’t exist. Derek could see my frustration. It was like the building was now playing tricks on me. 

He walked me out of the lift and sat me down on the bottom of the stairs before he finally began to speak.

“The building is like a living organism. It can seal off parts of the world, and it can open up others you never could have imagined. When those awful people burned that whole floor of residents I was devastated.

“Some wonderful people lived in those flats, both of the usual and unusual variety. But those people had no limit to their cruelty. Whole families burned alive, it was a tragedy that made me so angry. 

“I felt so guilty when it happened. I can predict what some of our more tricky residents are going to do and make sure I’m there to help. But those people were nothing to do with this place. I couldn’t see what they were planning, so I couldn’t stop it.”

At this point I noticed one of the hairless cats had sat between us, Derek looked at it with tears brimming in his eyes, he stroked it and it moved on to his lap. Dereks fingers didn’t burn at all. He continued.

“When it happened the building used its defence mechanisms and sealed off the entirety of the floor. It stopped the fire from spreading and kept the perpetrators there, to die by their own hands.

“The building only allowed the floor to be unsealed once they were dead. 

“It took about a week before those awful people turned up again. Asking for sugar at people’s doors, the first few let them in. It was so difficult, so many residents burned alive that I was having to use their remains for my garden just to hide the dead. The entire community were terrified and grieving for those that died. 

“No matter how hard I tried I still couldn’t predict them, or see them, so I took Prudence, who at the time seemed a perfectly reasonable woman, to the burned out floor.

“Floor 9, however, had been sealed again. There was no button in the lift, and it always skipped on the stairs. Only no one had noticed. This building really is a magnificent creature.”

I stared at him in amazement through the whole story, I was exhausted but my brain was working in overdrive to process what he was telling me. I had started to stroke the cat too, my fingers did burn, but I didn’t flinch, I found it’s company comforting. He carried on. 

“I went back later that night and took the stairs again, alone this time. I think my intentions were clear and the stairs allowed me access to floor 9 for the first time since just after the fire. 

“I bought Prudence to the floor within the hour. The stairs had stopped skipping floor 9 for me, although I later learned that when Prudence had tried alone she was not allowed access.

“We explored the floor, walking amongst the remnants of our dead friends belongings. Eventually, we came across one of the soulless arsonists, roaming the halls. It appears that’s where they spend their time when they aren’t out terrorising the residents trying to claim more victims. 

“He was disturbed and disoriented to see anyone not like them on that floor. He twitched a little and spat out the sugar line as if it was an automatic response, I almost felt sorry for him. He claimed to come from flat 66. More were approaching behind him. 

“Prudence was terrified, she was starting to sweat profusely and back away from the man, but it didn’t cool her down, he was burning her slowly. I felt nothing; See, the stranger things in life just don’t seem to affect me, I’ve never known why. Sometimes I even just know how to deal with them, like it’s programmed into me. On this new playing field, in their domain. I knew what to do. 

“I grabbed the man and ran him down to flat 66, 4 doors from where we were standing. I threw him into the flat and waited. The other arsonists were approaching.

“The man tried to exit the flat, that was doorless after the wooden doors all burned to cinders in the fire. But as he reached to door something stopped him. He couldn’t leave, no matter how hard he tried, or how much he screamed. 

“Prudence lit up, she grabbed hold of one that had tried to kill her friend, Molly. She remembered the flat number she had claimed to be from and repeated my actions, with a lot more sweating and some winces of pain. It worked again. 

“Prudence wanted to go after the rest, but as they got closer I could see the blisters forming on parts of her body, I dragged her out of the hallway and back into the stairwell. We ran. 

“She begged me to take her back, kept telling me that the stairs wouldn’t let her, that it was too dangerous. The residents had started to learn not to let them in and we had no casualties at all after we trapped the first two. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a problem I was intending to deal with, but it was around that time that we first learned the council would be building that monstrosity over the top of my garden.” He gestured to the window that just showed some of the neighbouring tower block.

“This left me not at my best, my intuition was failing me when a few months after that, I allowed Prudence and Molly to heard the creatures from the lift to floor 9. It’s one of my biggest regrets. I should never have walked them up there. But I didn’t know she was going to burn them all. She didn’t give me a chance to reason. 

“I became mistrusting of everyone and distracted. Not long after I went away for a long while. So I guess the arsonists remained and now they’re threatening you.

“Tomorrow I will go. I will fix the mess I left behind. I am so sorry it’s affected you so badly, I’d love to meet these twins. They sound incredibly brave.”

“They are.” I finally interrupted, “And I want to be there tomorrow. I want to lock Natalia away for good.”

“I can’t allow it. You’ll be attacked.” He cut me off entirely. I let it drop instantly but in the back of my mind I knew I would be there, no matter what. 

I went to sleep that night with my mind reeling. I wondered where Derek slept and if he even needed to. 

The next morning I left my flat early, passed the man on floor 5, and sat at waited on the steps at floor 8. I tested it of course, and just like anticipated, ascending any higher took me straight to floor 10. Or 11 depending on if you hit a skip. So I returned to floor 8, and I waited.

Derek hadn’t indicated what time he was coming. But I was ready. I would wait all day and night if I had to. But luckily I didn’t.

Derek was climbing the stairs at around 11am, I had already been there for 3 hours but it had been worth it. He looked particularly unimpressed to see me. His face still looked kind though, even with the sour expression. 

“I can’t stop you can I?” He sighed, sounding resigned in his tone. 

“Not for anything.”

“You have to promise to stay back. If you get your girl approaches you can do what you need to do, but you have to stay back.” He pleaded.

I nodded and stood up. We ascended the stairs and for the very first time in my new life here I saw the big plastic sign saying 9. The floor that didn’t exist. 

As we pushed through the door it was like entering an entirely new world. Everything was black. Burned to carbon. You could smell nothing but charcoal. Literally nothing but empty shells of homes and flakes of what used to be sentimental objects remained. It was devastating to witness. 

If you’ve ever visited a mass grave site you’ll understand partly how I was feeling. It was sickening, to think of all the lives needlessly lost. But I didn’t get time to think.

Natalia walked towards me. Flying down the hallway. 

“How the fuck did you get here?!” She screamed. Her eyes were wide and angry, I started to feel hotter already. 

Derek grabbed my arm and pulled me next to him. Making sure to keep a tight hold of my arm. 

“Where do you live?” Derek asked her, I started to back away as the sweat dropped from my brow. I desperately wanted to shout out the number, but I couldn’t. I was so hot, I wasn’t functioning properly, everything became so overwhelming I couldn’t remember what Georgia had said, what flat Natalia had claimed to come from.

“I’m not that stupid. I saw what happened to them.” She gestured over her shoulder to what must have been flat number 66, where a man laid on the floor, breathing but looking broken. Just existing in that room. Prudence had been creative with the truth yet again. She didn’t kill them, you can’t kill them. 

What had Georgia said? I racked my brains as I felt the skin on my face start to sting. I imagined her melting away, it was happening to me. I was next. 

And then, as my hair started to singe at the ends, it came to me. 

“71!” I screamed as loud as I could. I could barely see as Derek grabbed her and ran towards me with her. She was clawing at his eyes and face screaming at him to let go. But he didn’t burn. He just kept hold of her. When he approached flat 71 he beckoned me over. 

“You do it. Then get off of this floor.” He was blunt but reasonable, I complied. 

I pushed hard. There was nothing but anger in her eyes, she pushed my face hard with her hand as I got her to cross the boundary into flat 71. I felt my skin sizzle and blister. My whole face was in agony, but I didn’t stop pushing.

Watching Natalia try to fight her way out of a door that didn’t exist was both satisfying and humorous. The others had started to approach at the sound of the commotion. I lingered, hoping to watch her suffer but derek shot me one look and I knew. It was time to go, 

I ran out the corridor and back into the stairwell. I stopped for longer than I probably should have. But I knew I might not get to see that 9 again and it would be worth it. I waited for Derek on floor 9s stairwell. I couldn’t help but imagine the cultists burning to death the first time around. 

I could hear angry screams faintly from inside the corridor, they made me worry about Derek but I knew that really I didn’t need to. It took a while, but he eventually left the corridor and joined me in the stairwell. 

He didn’t say anything, he just looked at me and the third degree burns across my face. He didn’t need to speak, I knew he’d fixed the problem. 

We walked silently back down the stairs towards my flat. I looked back up at floor 9, knowing the building would seal it off for good. It took a few floors to reach floor 7 and I invited Derek in for a cup of tea. He rejected it, saying he wanted to go visit some old friends.

Despite my injuries I couldn’t help but smile, something I’d done was going to help these residents. I stood at my door and watched Derek walk away, pleased that there was some true good in this building. 

After a few steps down the hallway, Derek started to fade, almost like a cgi ghost in a movie, every step he became more transparent. I felt my stomach turn again, like it had outside the lift. I ran out to follow him. I called after him but by the time I had reached where he’d been he was gone. I walked the entire corridor to the window at the back. I looked out the window into the small concrete heavy garden and hoped to see him sat on the memorial bench.

I didn’t see him, instead I saw Prudence. Hacking at my tiny planted patch with shears.

nosleep,A Conversation with a Stranger on the Bus,"“Huh?” I asked, pulling off one side of my headphones.

*“I said I like your boots,”* the man repeated.

“Oh, thank you.”

*“I had a bunch of pairs exactly like ‘em for years and years—a good workin boot, ya know?”*

“They definitely are, I use them every day on the job.”

*“Where’s that at?”*

“Turner Construction.”

*“Ah, yes, yes. You’re building that big ole’ thing up on East Avenue, ain’t ya?”*

“Yes, sir. It’s going to be one of the biggest in the city.”

*“So it seems. I used to do construction too, ya know? That was way back in the day. I started back when your mama was probably a toddler.”*

“Oh, yeah? With a company, or freelance, or…?”

*“My papa had a small construction and carpentry business. He hired me on when I was, oh, maybe 15 or so. That was all the way back in 1962! We built houses, mostly, a couple small apartment complexes—nothin as big as what you’re working on.”*

“Did you like it?”

*“Boy, you bet your ass I did. Workin all day was a free gym membership! Ha! Plus, all the perks that came with it.”*

“Perks?”

He smiled. *“Can ya keep a secret, boy?”*

“Yes, sir.”

*“You ever play in a construction site as a child? When I was a lil’ one, me and my buddies would sneak into houses being built and explore ‘em. Maybe break a couple bottles here and there.”*

“Yeah! My neighbors and I used to do that when I was a kid. My house was one of the first built in our neighborhood, then the rest came later. We probably explored every house on the block before they were finished—when they were just wood skeletons—maybe breaking a couple bottles too, to tell you the truth.”

*“Of course ya did. Who wouldn’t, given the opportunity? But that’s all the childish stuff. The real perks came later in life, when I was an adult.”*

“Oh?”

*“Oh yes, boy. Imagine this. The year is 1980 with no cell phones in sight. You talk up a pretty lady at the local bar and hit it off. You tell her about your new construction project, and she wants to go see it.”*

“Uh huh.”

*“Well then ya take her there! You and her all alone in a skeleton of a home, as you said.”*

“Wouldn’t it be a little more private back at your own house?”

*“More private, sure, maybe. But much messier.”*

I paused. “How so?”

*“Well, you don’t just take a girly down to a construction site at night just to get your diddly fiddled with. You take her for... ya know.”*

“No, I don’t know.”

*“For the easy disposal, boy.”*

“Disposal…?”

*“Ya cut the girly up, or do whatever your preference is. Ya do whatever ya wanna do with her, and ya put her under the house. Ya bury her and your stained clothes under there too. Once the job’s done, no one’ll ever see that stuff again. It’s gone. Eventually, a brand new house is sitting on top of your deed.”*

The bus rolled to a stop.

*“Well, this is my stop.”* He stood, patted my shoulder, and I recoiled. He walked off the bus.

The only thing running through my mind was a memory. I was a kid, no older than six. My friends and I were playing hide and seek. I hid in the crawl space under my front porch, and when I was hiding, I found a pair of boots half-buried in the dirt.

The exact same type of boots I was wearing then, on the bus. The exact same type of boots we’d found in the crawl spaces of every house in our neighborhood.",Entertainment

I had to do something, and I had to do it right now.  If Melanie was somehow a fake, that meant they must have sent her.  And if they sent her, that meant they knew.  They knew about the messages in her painting.  They knew about me asking questions.  And they knew I didn’t hit a button during any of it.

I felt panic and fear crawling up my chest, making it hard to breathe.  Standing up, I started pacing, periodically glancing back at the monitor to see if Rachel could help me, tell me what I needed to do next.  But she had laid down on her bed.  It was hard to tell for sure with her back to the camera, but I think she was crying.

No, I needed to fix this.  Get her out of there.  And if I didn’t have a better plan, I’d just have to go with the one I already had.  

Feeling the hard eye of the ceiling camera on me, I went to the door and stepped back into the locker room.  My phone was in my locker, and after messing up the combination the first time, I got the door open and got it out.  Gripping it tightly, I tried to hold it by my side casually, but I knew there was little point.  If they knew everything, I wasn’t going to be able to hide anything.  I just had to try and be fast, get some kind of message out to people that could help Rachel before they got to me.

I opened the camera on the phone as I re-entered the surveillance room and hit record.  It made a small beeping noise and once I was sure it was recording, I turned the camera on myself.

“My name…my name is Tommy.  Thomas Calhoun.  And my job is watching a woman trapped in a room.  This is not a joke or a movie or…whatever.  This is real.  For three years my job is to sit in this room…”  I moved the camera slowly around the room, taking in the door to the bathroom, the water cooler, the desk with the monitors, keyboard, and button box, “…and watch a video feed of a woman locked up in a bedroom somewhere.”  I stepped closer to the desk and made sure the monitor showing Rachel was clear and in focus.  “I didn’t know this woman was a prisoner at first…or I tricked myself into thinking she wasn’t because the money was good.  Either way, I know she is now.  She is in danger and so am I.”

After lingering on video of her for a few more seconds to make sure every detail could be seen, I turned the camera back on myself.  I had to hurry, or the video might be too big to send quickly.  I was trying to stay calm, but I felt myself tearing up as I went on, and I did my best to keep my words clear.  “Please help her.  I don’t know where she is.  I don’t know who has her, because I don’t know who I really work for.  But they are bad people and she is not safe.”

“All I know is that I work at a building at [redacted] right outside of San Antonio.  (Per Nosleep rules, to be clear this address is not real.) I only know the names of two other people connected to this place.  The man who hired me, Mr. Solomon.  And a man who might have a job like mine…Charlie Jeffers…no, Jefferies I think.  I don’t know if they are real people…I mean, I don’t know if that is their real names.  Please.  I’m not crazy.  I know how this sounds.  Just come here, see the room.  Figure out where she is and help her.  And…”

I heard the muffled sound of the outer door opening into the locker room and I frantically fumbled with the phone to stop the recording.  How do I send?  Oh no, how do I…there it is.  I hit the button to share, and felt a new panic rising.  Who should I send it to?  I had only a handful of contacts, and I just selected them all.  Maybe at least one of them would take it seriously and get help.  As I heard the door to the surveillance room opening behind me, I hit send.

**Not connected to data service or WiFi.  Please send again when connected.**

*What?  No no no no…*

I turned to see Mr. Solomon entering the room.  He was flanked by two large men in dark suits that looked like bodyguards or something.  Raising a finger, he wagged it at me.  

“No service in here, Thomas.  But then you should never need service in here, so long as you followed the rules.”

****

They took me easily.  I tried to make it to the bathroom and close the door, but the two guards stopped me and pulled me down.  They put the…what do you call them?  Zipties on my hands and feet and pulled a black bag over my head.  Then I was being carried out of the room and it felt like they must have put me in the back of a van that was pulled right up to the building.  I was laying on what felt like thin, weird smelling carpet that covered a hard metal layer underneath.

I heard someone get into the van with me, and I asked where we were going.  If they would just take me and let Rachel go.  There was a short laugh overhead and then Mr. Solomon’s voice as he told me that he would explain everything when we got where we were going.  For now, he said, I needed to relax.  It was a long drive and I would need the rest.  

I went to say more, but then I felt a sharp pain in my neck.  They had stabbed me, or…no, they injected me with something.  I was feeling so strange now, but I had to stay awake.  I had to try and get away, I had to…

“Hello again, Thomas.”

I blinked as I began looking around.  My mouth was dry and my head hurt, but otherwise I felt okay.  I wasn’t tied up any more--Instead I was laying back on a padded table like I’d seen when I went to the doctor.

But this wasn’t a doctor’s office.  The room was large, and aside from the padded table, it held a small bed, a desk with a computer monitor on it, and a couple of chairs.  Sitting in one of those chairs was Mr. Solomon.

I raised up slowly, blinking at him.  “Where is she?  Is Rachel okay?”

The man smiled.  “You really are something, Thomas.  Trying to be the hero, even if you don’t quite know how.  I respect that.”  Licking his lips, he leaned forward slightly.  “In fact, I respect that so much that I’ve decided to start our new relationship with as much honesty as I’m allowed.  Some of my colleagues disagree with this approach, but you know what?  Fuck them.  This is my project, and I think you deserve to know what’s going on.”  Looking more serious, he stood up, lifting the gun he had been holding casually in his lap.  “But before we get into the details, would you like to see Rachel?”

I slid off the table and nodded as I caught myself from falling.  My legs were still wobbly from whatever they had given me, but I barely noticed.  “Yes, please.  Let me see her.  The real her.”

Mr. Solomon gave a small laugh and gestured toward a nearby door.  “Yes, reality is always best.  She’s just there in the next room.”  

I stumbled my way forward, my legs getting better as I walked, and when I grabbed the doorknob, it turned easily.  I expected the door to lead to her bedroom, but instead it opened into another room a lot like the one I had been in, though the stuff in it was different.  Strange machines filled the walls, and in the back of the room was a large…aquarium?  I didn’t know.  It was a big cylinder taller than I was, and it was filled with some kind of gray liquid.   There was a shape in that liquid,

“Go ahead, Thomas.  Feel free to go have a good look.  You’ve earned it.”  I felt my stomach clenching tighter at Mr. Solomon’s words and the meanness in them.  My legs felt heavy again now, but it wasn’t from the drugs this time.

Shuffling forward, I could see the shape was a person.  *Oh no*  Or at least a body, because it was clear from just looking at it that the person was dead.  It was very well-preserved, but I could see how the skin hung wrong and looked bloated in spots.  *Oh God, no no no*  Its hair, which had been floating like seaweed in front of its face, drifted away as I reached the glass, and I could see Rachel staring out at me.

“Murderer!”  I turned on Solomon and started to run toward him when he shot me.  Suddenly I was on the ground convulsing as he stepped closer.

“Don’t worry, Thomas.  It won’t kill you.  Just make you unable to move much for a bit.”  I heard more footfalls as my body began to still.  “Get him up, take him back to the other room.”

I could barely feel anything as I was carried back to the padded table and propped up into a sitting position.  This time I was strapped down, but I guessed it was more so I didn’t fall off, because I couldn’t move anything other than my head, and even that just a little.  I could hardly see at all for crying, but I recognized the blurry shape of Solomon sitting back down in front of me.

“Before you ask…well, when you are able to ask anything again, yes, that is Rachel.  Not a fake Rachel, not a dummy, and not some kind of trick.  As I said, the time for tricks is past.  Now is the time for truth.”

Frowning slightly, he went on.  “Thomas, I understand that showing you that, showing you her body that way, might seem very cruel.  You may hate me for it right now.  I would understand it if you did.  But you called me a murderer, and at least in this specific context, I think that is unfair, because I didn’t kill Rachel.  In truth, I’ve been with this aspect of the project for only seven years.”

He gestured back to the door behind him.  “And Rachel has been dead for over eight.”

I felt my eyes widen as though they belonged to someone else’s body.  It was more lies.  More tricks.  All of it.  Oh God, it had to be.

“Do you know what remote viewing is?”  He rolled his eyes.  “Sorry, right, you can’t talk right now.  I’ll just assume you don’t.  Remote viewing is a broad term for the ability to see things that are far away from you physically, to know things you shouldn’t be able to know through your normal five senses.  Some describe it as a psychic ability, though there are several schools of thought as to how and why it works.”

His eyes fixed on mine intently.  “Because it does work, Thomas.  Various governments and private organizations have studied it for a very long time, and while publicly it is always ridiculed as pseudoscience and foolish superstition, the reality is that some people have the innate ability…that means it comes naturally…to somehow see other places.”

“Rachel was one of those people.  She came into the program when she was seventeen, having been identified via a front-facing screening process that was ran as a psychological test that paid subjects well at a time when Rachel was looking to make some money.  Three months after being identified as a good candidate, she was taken, and after the initial adjustment period, she became a largely compliant asset that quickly rose to the top of our talent pool.”

Solomon folded his hands on his knee.  “I know you cared for her, Thomas, so I think this is worth sharing.  Rachel was never treated badly, other than her confinement and the occasional test that was mildly unpleasant.  No, we all treasured her.  She was enormously talented, not just as a remote viewer, but as an artist.  That’s how she would convey what she saw, you understand.  She would enter into an almost trancelike state when she painted, and when she was done, she would have given us a painting of images and words that provided…well, it was very valuable information.”  He chuckled.  “If you ever wondered, that’s why there was always such care that the paintings were never shown to the camera.”

Picking at his pants, he went on.  “Rachel was so talented, that she was selected for a new program that we thought might greatly enhance or alter her ability.  We introduced something…foreign…into her body.  At first, nothing seemed to change.  If anything, the accuracy of her remote viewing was declining, which was a problem for us and for her.”

“But then we realized that we were reading the new paintings wrong.  She was able to see more clearly than ever--she just was no longer bound to only current events.  Now her sight transcended time.”  He paused, and I realized he was enjoying telling the story.  The bastard was having a good time, pausing to make it more dramatic.  I would fucking kill him.  “While this made some of her paintings less immediately useful, they became much more valuable as we were able to decipher them.  For a time, it looked as though everything was working better than we had ever hoped.”

His lips thinned.  “And then, one day, she showed a painting to the camera.”

“It said, ‘Please help me Thomas’.  This immediately sent up all kinds of red flags.  She knew not to show paintings to the camera, and now she was trying to communicate with someone?  We didn’t disrupt her routine, but an intensive investigation began into who she was talking to.  Was it one of her handlers?  One of the technicians?  Someone from her past life?  But nothing checked out.”

Leaning back in his chair, a look of pride grew on Solomon’s face as he continued.  “I was the one that first suggested the idea that she was, intentionally or not, knowingly or not, seeing and talking to someone in the future.  I was still an outside consultant at the time, but by that point we had more strange behaviors from her, including the second message painting, ‘That girl isn’t me’.  My theory made some sense, but it very quickly ran into a greater obstacle.”

“The introduction of the foreign material had not been as seamless as we had hoped, despite her having been stable for almost three years since it was implanted.  Whether it was due to her increasing emotional upset and stress, or simply the passage of time, she suddenly began to deteriorate.  Her work became more erratic and hard to understand as her body began to decline.  We were monitoring her health closely, but it didn’t matter.  Five days after she painted ‘That girl isn’t me’, she suddenly went into cardiac arrest and died.  Somewhat inexplicably, we were unable to resuscitate her.”

The man sighed.  “This was a great loss.  And it required adjustments of my theory.  Based on everything we knew, it still made sense that she was talking to someone.  Someone with access to the camera feed, and very likely someone named Thomas.  If Thomas was viewing that camera footage in the future, as I believed, then he must be working for us in the future.”  He gave me a thin smile.  “And whether you believe that the future is set in stone or not, I’m all for giving it a helping hand.”

“Seven years ago I began the Thomas Project.  Over the course of that time I have overseen the screening and hiring of forty-three men named Thomas at several different sites, all with one very specific job.  To watch the videos of Rachel from just before her implant to the time of her death.”

I tried to speak, but my mouth still wouldn’t work.  I wanted to say he was lying, that it didn’t make sense, that it *was* another trick…but I think I wanted to hear it more for myself.  Because I didn’t think he was lying.  I didn’t think it was a trick.  And I thought I was starting to understand.

“The point wasn’t really them watching the videos, of course.  It was how they *reacted* to watching the videos.  What they did, and how that matched up with what Rachel had done in response in the past.”

“Thirteen percent quit after the first day.  Thirty-eight percent hit either the red or the green button after the first message asking for help and saying their name.  Twenty-two percent attempted to contact the authorities before reaching the stage where ‘Melanie’ was introduced.”  He shook his head slightly.  “I wish I could take credit for her introduction, but it wasn’t my suggestion.  We assumed from the ‘that girl isn’t me’ message that there was a double of Rachel introduced to you at some point, perhaps to kill you or dissuade you or find out what you knew.  But it took a few tries until we felt it was well-refined, and as I’ve pointed out, only twenty-seven percent made it that far.  And all of them failed the next test.”  He pointed at me.

“Her name.”

“You see, the girl you’ve been watching, that talented, wonderful girl whose body is preserved in the next room?  Her name was Rachel Donovan.  I had always wondered if Rachel was merely seeing you, or if there was some kind of connection between the two of you.  When you called ‘Melanie’ Rachel, I knew that we had finally found the right Thomas--the distant point of light that our Rachel was looking at across space and time.”

I swallowed thickly and found I could feel my tongue, if only a little.  Slurring badly, I pushed out a single word.

“W-why?”

Solomon looked surprised.  “I’d have thought that’d be clear by now.  You’re our only remaining link to one of our greatest treasures.  Perhaps you have a similar ability, or it may be that she forged the link purely though her own talent and will.  But either way, you are important and you have more work to do.”  He stood up and moved over to the table where he turned on the monitor.  As it came to life, I saw it was a frozen image of Rachel’s room--a tape paused where I had left off watching.  Turning back to me, the man looked solemn.

[“You have to watch the rest of it.  Because Rachel painted you more pictures before she died, and we have to know what they mean.”](https://redd.it/9ndww5)

nosleep,Buying a weighted blanket from Amazon was the worst decision I’ve ever made.,"You’ve heard of them. They started as a tool to help calm autistic people and people with anxiety and insomnia. Over the past few years they’ve grown into a popular household item, and with good reason. They’re comforting. 

We’d pay just about anything for some comfort. Do you ever notice how that’s most of what we spend our money on now, us single guys? Why do we constantly crave to be comforted?

My life wasn’t particularly uncomfortable. Not then. I had finally gotten back track with reality after the disappearance of my wife and kids two years ago. I’d sold our little house in the suburbs, gotten a cheap apartment close to my job, attended all the therapy appointments the police and caseworkers recommended, and gone back to work. I still couldn’t sleep for more than an hour or two a night, even with the medications they gave me, but that was okay. The worst of it was over. Shock and grief can only last so long. 

I got one anyway; ordered the thing off Amazon. In queen size, like all my bedding, even though my queen no longer slept in it. 

It arrived ridiculously late. I’m a Prime member, and I selected the free two day shipping. But it at least had gotten there, so I didn’t send a complaint, despite the state it was in after its long journey - not in the familiar smiley cardboard box, but in a shapeless lump haphazardly placed halfway on my front doorstep, halfway in the parking lot. It had been clumsily wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string, and possibly kicked the whole way here, from the look of it. 

“It’s like a quaint, rustic thing,” I announced (to nobody in particular) as I dragged it into my apartment. “A present from grandma, back home, uh, on the ranch!” 

But even talking to myself couldn’t convince me. It looked like a bomb, delivered straight off the set of an action movie. The package was beaten up, stained, and the rough jute string was frayed and nearly falling apart. It looked singed in several places, too. It took me two hours, three gin and tonics, and a hearty microwave dinner to work up enough courage (or suicidal depression) to actually open the thing. 

The blanket was bundled into a poorly-folded cube, held together by another length of the same string that had bound the paper. I wasn’t impressed with its packaging, but the blanket itself looked alright - plush, quilted blue microfiber with thick seams - and felt like it was the right weight. It smelled normal; you know that clean but vaguely chemical-ish odor new blankets have. 

I checked the tag, wondering if I ought to clean it, but the ink was smeared and blurry. It seemed risky to throw it in the washing machine without knowing the correct settings to use, so I just threw it over my duvet and went about my business. 

At around midnight I decided to give it a try. I had nothing left to lose; I’d spent hundreds of dollars on my bed over the past few months; the newest and best quality memory-foam adjustable cooling mattress, thousand count Egyptian cotton sheets, customizable-filling pillows, and none of it had brought me a single good night’s sleep. Honestly I expected the same to happen that night, but it was fun to pretend. 

I slid between the cool sheets and pulled the blankets up over me. The new blanket was a bit lumpy, but I knew from reading reviews that this was normal due to shipping, and would smooth out over time. The weight was immediately noticeable, and to my surprise, I felt...comforted. 

When I closed my eyes, I imagined my youngest two had crawled into bed with us, and were laying on top of me, suppressing giggles as they tried not to wake me up. An artfully folded section of the blanket at my back became the familiar bulk of my wife beside me, and when I opened my eyes again it was ten in the morning and I was late for work. 

I’ve never been so thrilled to receive a write-up. 

That weird chemical smell didn’t really fade, though, and gradually it became more noticeable. By the end of the week I could smell (or imagined I could) the strange, neutral odor on my skin, even after a shower. By the end of the month, it had become unbearable. 

I took it to a dry cleaners, thinking that I’d been lazy because I was so enamored over my renewed relationship with sleep. I was ready for the elderly Korean woman behind the counter to judge me over the stink. I had my excuses rehearsed; work was crazy, I’d had it in my car and forgotten, and I’d had Indian food for lunch and forgotten the leftovers in my car over the weekend, which had amplified the smell. 

But I didn’t have a chance to recite this story. She only waved a handheld metal detector over my blanket and said, “Filling wrong. Can’t clean. Try spray with Fabreeze! You can get on Amazon!”

I couldn’t imagine what about the filling could be wrong, and I told her so. Sure it was still a bit clumpy from shipping, but Amazon had listed the filler as polypropylene, and all the reviews recommended dry-cleaning. 

“Metal,” she explained, then shooed me out the door with twenty pounds of smelly quilt in my arms. 

Another month of beautiful, comfortable sleep went by before I couldn’t live with the smell anymore. People had begun to comment on it at work. Megan, my manager, had tactfully suggested I check my laundry machine to see if maybe a rat had gotten in there and died or something. That was my last straw. 

I came home determined to get rid of the blanket and buy a new one. But you know what happens when you lose your entire world, with no answers? You start to cling to things. You hoard them. Because you can’t lose the comfort they bring you. 

I tried six dry cleaners before I found one who spoke enough English (through a heavy Boston accent; but you can’t have everything) to explain it to me. 

“Sometimes they fill these with glass beads,” he said. “The factories that make the beads, they‘ll lose a screw or some metal filings in the batch, and it all goes into the blanket. Machines in factories, you get me? Yeah, so what you can do is cut the seam a little and dump the balls into a bucket or the bathtub or something. Throw the blanket in the wash, hang it up to dry. Then you just pour ‘em back in and sew it up.”

I told him I didn’t know how to sew. 

“You can get a funnel off Amazon for a few bucks,” he said, and shrugged at me in a particularly apathetic sort of way before turning back to a pile of stained panties. 

I did exactly that. They took a week to ship it, which was annoying, but it was a bank holiday that Monday so the delay made sense. 

Armed with my funnel and a bucket, I pulled the edge of the blanket over the bed and cut a tiny hole into the seam near the corner. I expected the beads to come pouring out in a clattery flood as soon as I dropped the corner into the bucket. Instead there was a single, loud thump as a lump of something metallic hit the plastic. 

I peered into it and saw a gold circle. A wedding ring with a fingerprint carved into it, and an inscription on the inside that I couldn’t see because a chunk of meat and bone were still inside it, but I knew what it said. It said “to love’s eternal glory”. It was my fingerprint on the band. 

My mind went blank and I lost control of my legs, forcing me to sit heavily on the edge of my bed. The motion tugged the blanket over another few inches, and more of the filling came out. This wasn’t a flood, it was more of a...heave, like the blanket was vomiting up pieces of crumbling, dry flesh and bone. Like a cyst being squeezed, thick clumps of horribly recognizable stuff squirted out into the bucket. My oldest son’s teeth clattered loudly against the sides, and I saw flashes of silvery fillings from the cavities caused by gum disease he’d inherited from his mom. 

There was a scrap of almost-bleached-white Hello Kitty band-aid wrapped around a tiny knuckle joint, and I remembered how my daughter had scraped her finger knocking loudly on her brother’s splintered bedroom door, and how she’d smiled through her tears when she saw the special, fun band-aid her daddy had put over the scratch. 

I’d been sleeping for two months beneath the heavy weight of a thousand mummified pieces of my wife and children’s bodies. 

The cops couldn’t trace the package, even though they tried. The security cameras in my apartment complex showed an unmarked brown van with no license plate, which dumped the package directly from the window onto my front step. There was nothing to track. 

Amazon’s lawyers provided evidence proving they’d packed and shipped the correct (boxed and labeled) blanket. Let me be fair to them; I must say that they offered me a prompt refund. 

In store credit. 

But I won’t be buying anything off Amazon ever again. I’ve gotten rid of my Echo; that was the first thing I threw out, along with all my new bedding, and I canceled my Prime membership. Just for good measure, I threw out my smartphone and smartwatch as well. Amazon and smart technology are convenient and that’s great, but it’s not worth the risk if things like this can happen. 

It’s the only possible explanation, after all - how else could they have found the bodies?",Entertainment
nosleep,Has anyone heard of the Left/Right Game? (Part 10)(Final),"Well then… here we are.

I have to be honest; when I posted the first of these logs from my bedroom in North London, I didn’t think it would go very far. After all, why would it? I wasn’t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn’t lead anywhere.
 
Suffice to say I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Over the past two months, the incredible advice I’ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you’ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice’s records.
 
I realise I’ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice’s section, that’s fine.
 
Otherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.
 
It’s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I’d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.
 
She was a forum member, who’d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she’d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.
 
We spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.
 
Question One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?
 
I’ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn’t seeking return.
 
I’d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she’d told us as much. I’m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we’ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I’d kindly ask you find another way to help.
 
Question Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?
 
It’s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I’d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn’t yet have an answer.
 
I decided to take a drive while I figured it out… I’ve been in my car for the rest of the night,
 
After an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I’d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.
 
There was no denying that the place resembled Alice’s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I’d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice’s steps towards Rob Guthard’s street.
 
OK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I’d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn’t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I’m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn’t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.
 
Alice was always the smart one.
 
What I’m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn’t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn’t a mirror shop this time of course, that’s only the 34th turn when you’re coming the other way, in fact I’m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should’ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion… I don't think she was there at all.
 
The moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I’d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.
 
It wasn’t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice’s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I’d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I’d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice’s account, but I’d seen no first hand proof of the Left/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I’d know soon enough.
 
I crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn’t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.
 
I took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.
 
Ahead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.
 
I’d always known it was true.
 
In the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night’s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn’t have a response.
 
In the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you’re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.
 
And now… here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.
 
Though perhaps the street’s not as quiet as I thought.
 
I’ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn’t the woman in grey this time.
 
Though it’s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I’ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice’s logs.

He watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.

I wonder if he can help.

The Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20/02/2017
 
The Left/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.
 
I remember reading it on my lunch break.
 
I remember it made me laugh.
 
The submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.
 
I was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.
 
Somewhere around page three, between the description of the game’s rules and the exhaustive list of “Required Skills”, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.
 
They’d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn’t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man’s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard’s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.
 
Later that day, I found myself in the editor’s office making a case for it. They didn’t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn’t be gone long.
 
It’s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven’t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.
 
I still largely agree with this assessment. It’s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I’ve chosen to type up the following account in full.
 
Whoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.
 
I’m quite sure this will be my final instalment.
 
*****
 
The moon has broken, and in my entire life, I’ve never witnessed an evening so still.
 
The air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.
 
Yet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can’t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That’s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.
 
A few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.
 
The stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It’s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.
 
At least that’s what I thought it was at first. It didn’t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That’s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.
 
I was driving through the centre of a lake.
 
The water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I’ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It’s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I’m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.
 
I lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I’ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don’t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I’ve quickly grown used to the process. If I’ve learned anything from the road, it’s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.
 
A few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  
 
I press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.
 
There’s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It’s a miracle I’d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. 

As I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.
 
It’s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There’s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.
 
With a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water’s edge.
 
The body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She’s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who’d tried to repel me from the road, who’d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.
 
It seems her ramblings weren’t completely void of fact. It’s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.

It doesn’t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.
 
As I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.
 
I find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I’m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.
 
My hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie’s exposed arm.
 
Digging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie’s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.
 
The promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie’s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake’s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I’d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it’s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.

Marjorie wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She’d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road’s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body’s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road’s influence wasn’t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. 
 
Her other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.

After a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob’s foldable spade.
 
A long few hours follow. I’ve never dug someone’s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.

It takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It’s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it’s an act I don’t have the right to perform. 

Once it’s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.

**MARJORIE:** You.

Even before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There’s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch’s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it’s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.

Reluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.

**AS:** Marjorie.

Unlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.

**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I… I gave him up for you.

**AS:** I’m… I’m sorry Marjorie, I don’t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.

**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!

I don’t know quite what to say. It’s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.

**AS:** Marjorie I… I didn’t mean you to.

Marjorie’s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.

**MARJORIE:** Oh… oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now… now you’re here.

Marjorie’s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.

**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!

Marjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I’m struck by an idea I’ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.

Marjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. 

There's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. 

Perhaps we must choose our eternity.

After all my time on the road, that’s possibly the most terrifying notion I’ve encountered. 

**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.

Marjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I’m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I’ve never seen her wear before. 

**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn’t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. 

Marjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.

I hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.

**AS:** I don’t know if this can help but… stranger things have happened.

As she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we’re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. 

Before I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.

A few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It’s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I’ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.

It’s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I’m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.

The sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. 

I back up against the Wrangler’s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.

Squinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night’s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. 

Staring through the shuddering fracture, I’m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.

In the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.

The being is unlike anything I’ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature’s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.
 
Somehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.

**AS:** It’s you… isn’t it. You’re the voice I’ve been hearing. You’re the one who brought me here.
 
The bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler’s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity’s smouldering core.

**AS:** Can I get an interview?

The creature doesn’t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.

**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.

Each reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.

In the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.

**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?

The being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.

**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.

**AS:** Like whatever’s through there?

I gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature’s spiralling form.

**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.
 
**AS:** But it wasn’t her… she thought she was seeing her own future… but it was-
 
**VOICE:** It was you.

Those three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow… a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.

I hadn’t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, 
 
**AS:** She didn’t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them… the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I’d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?
 
**VOICE:** Yes.
 
**AS:** But… why? You toyed with so many lives across… across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?
 
**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.
 
It speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.

The creature continues.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity… and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.
 
**AS:** Then why didn’t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn’t lift a finger… after everything that happened-
 
**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.
 
**AS:** As they… needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They’re all gone. Do you not care at all?

In response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.
 
**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.
 
**AS:** You’re saying I don’t understand death?
 
**VOICE:** You don’t.
 
**AS:** ... That still doesn’t make it right.
 
**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.

**AS:** What even are you?
 
**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you’d understand.
 
**AS:** That's not good enough.

The creature doesn’t respond, as if it doesn’t feel it needs to. So far it’s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there’s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.

Still, that doesn’t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature’s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.

**AS:** And what if I don’t want any part of this?

**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.

**AS:** That’s the only reason?

**VOICE:** Do you need another?

It doesn’t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it’s speaking of. Ever since the city, I’ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.

I’ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.

**AS:** No… no, I don’t trust you. I don’t-

**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.

The creature’s already stark glow starts to intensify.
 
**VOICE:** I’ve watched you, on every turn … across every moment of your journey.

One of the creature’s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.

It’s as if I’m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you questioning.

Though we can’t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature’s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.

A second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I’m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest… a silent radio by my side.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you struggle.

The second window closes. The creature has made its point.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you fight… to make your way here.

**VOICE:** You will not turn around. 

**AS:** You make it sound like I don’t have a choice.
 
**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.

As much as I’ve grown to detest the creature’s presumption, in that moment, I know it’s right.

What it’s saying is true. I’ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn’t arrived at all, I’d already be heading out over the bridge. 

I’m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob’s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there’s no denying the impulse is there. It’s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona… and it’s buried deeper than I’ve ever wanted to admit.

**AS:** Can I… do I get to say goodbye?
 
The entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.
 
Picking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.
 
**AS:** How… how long do I have?

**VOICE:** Long enough.
 
The entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. 

As it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.
 
**AS:** I’m still not certain I trust you.
 
The being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. 
 
**VOICE:** … I remember.
 
A moment later, the being is gone.
 
I stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity’s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.

It could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.

It was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I’d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. 

I’d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose… or about what I might inevitably become.

A short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.

If you’ve been reading from the beginning, you’ve finally caught up with me.

I hope you’ll allow me a few personal messages.

To Rob. I hope you’re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I’ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn’t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.

To my mum and dad, I’m sorry I won’t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can’t bring myself to face you. I can’t imagine the pain I’ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I’m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.

And finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I’m sorry. I always thought I’d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn’t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I’m not going to.

But I wish we could have been friends for longer.

It feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard’s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. 

Like so many other things, that’s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone’s ever been, I know exactly what’s going to happen next.

I’m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. 

And from there I’ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.

To a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is.",Entertainment
nosleep,My son asked me to check the closet for monsters. I didn't need to.,"I recently went through a pretty nasty divorce, but I got the only thing that mattered out of it: full custody of my 4-year old son.


Lost nearly everything else in the process so we had to relocate to a new house with barely any luggage or furniture.


Truly a fresh new start.


I heard him call for me during our first night at our new home. It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside.


He was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn’t surprising given the circumstances.


He’s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he’s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age.


And you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you’re sleeping in a new environment, right?


That’s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke.


It was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought.


But something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request.


Something was wrong.


I turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.


When you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm’s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them.


That’s why I didn’t freak out. I couldn’t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing:


We had to leave the room.


We had to leave the house *immediately*.


“Alright champ, of course” I said, faking bravery.


Then I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him:


“Hey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there’s a monster in there, I’ll have to kick its *BUTT* all over your room!”


He chuckled and said “*okay*”.


I made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word “*butt*” because it’s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster.


As soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out.


When I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go.


I jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute.


I told him I couldn’t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked “*celebrate what*”, to which I replied “*just us two together, I love you buddy.*”


It was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn’t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home.


As I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I’d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn’t.


And I know his room didn’t have a closet.",Entertainment
nosleep,My friend and I made “ghost pornography” for fun. It’s not funny anymore,"I have been a nude model for 2 years. It started off with sexy cosplay, then I photographed Suicide Girls style, and finally, when I had people up to pay enough, solo porn.

I used to live in a crappy kitchenette, but once I was successful enough, I was able to afford a nicer place. Things got better when I moved in with my new roommate, but also weirder.

I’m not using our real names or our artistic names here because I’m scared as fuck.

My new roommie, Savannah, was a cheerful and sweet girl. Her perky personality had flocked plenty of followers and fans, way more than I had myself, and she was making some good money; for instance, she was a homeowner at 22.

Her place was huge, and she decided to rent her extra room for an attractive price, as long as the other resident was fine with her vast collection of sex toys being displayed in the living room.

I thought that was hilarious and we immediately hit it off, so the other resident became me. The fact that we were both nude models helped our friendship, but to be fair I had met some other girls in my field before, and most of them were a stick in the mud.

Savannah was nice, tidy and amazingly respectful of my personal space. She didn’t act like she owned the place, even though she literally did. I had spent a good few months before things started to go south.

“So, Ayla”, Savannah approached me over breakfast. “Would you be willing to collab with me? I have a request for a private two-girl job and I thought it made sense to invite you first since it will be so much easier to arrange our schedules.”

I wasn’t doing much, just my nightly streaming, my regular sets and my sets for patreons. I asked more about the job.

“Well”, she laughed. “I have to tell you it’s one of a kind. It’s nothing dehumanizing or anything, but it’s weird as fuck. This guy… he jerks off to shadows. He wants us to pretend we’re fucking them.”

“Fucking the shadows?!” I asked, and laughed loudly. She confirmed, laughing too. It was insane, but relatively harmless, like when some guy paid me 5 grand to legally bind me to not show my feet to any other man but him for a whole year. So I only take my socks off to shower and it’s been months since I don’t go to the beach.

When Savannah told me how much the client was willing to pay for such a thing, I was immediately in.

“It will be so embarrassing, but kinda fun, right?” I said.

“Yeah, and with that I can finally stop taking private requests and focus on other things”, Savannah replied, happily. She’s sort of a do-it-all artist – model, photographer, painter and so on.

A few more e-mail exchanges with [shadowfucker@\[redacted\].com](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com) and he had approved of me and discussed the details with Savannah. He wanted two videos a week – on Mondays and Thursdays, and each should be at least 30 minutes long.

A very reasonable request, considering that, with my share of what he was paying, I could drop everything else and still live comfortably.

He would send us the equipment before the first week, then outfits every two weeks.

I was the one to receive the large box from UPS, as Savannah wasn’t home. I knew she had a P. O. box to avoid disclosing her real address, but this one came straight to our place.

Weird, but considering how big this client was, I could understand her making an exception for him, and didn’t say anything about it.

Later that day, we opened the box. It contained some light strobes, a few large but hollow wooden and metal objects, eight sets of costumes – wigs included –, a photograph and a small package marked *otherworldly condoms*.

“Wow, imagine being this lunatic!” Savannah grabbed the little package laughing, then opened one of them.

They looked nothing like regular condoms; they were more like those plastic bags you use to freeze stuff, but the material was so much thinner and slightly iridescent.

“That’s probably something he made up to make it more realistic, right?” I asked, then read the instructions aloud. “When having sex with the shadows, make sure to protect your whole groin with otherworldly condoms. They can unfold to thrice its size.”

The outfits were actually cute and we spent some time deciding when we were going to use each of them; the client had perfectly guessed our sizes.

Then the photograph finally caught my attention.

It showed the right way to arrange the equipment on the room, but funnily enough, the room depicted was incredibly alike to Savannah’s studio – our third bedroom. Unlike me, she didn’t often film/shoot in her own bedroom, preferring to use a mostly neutral room where she could set up scenarios or just take cleaner pics and videos.

I couldn’t help but feel that the picture had been taken exactly in her studio – *at the very place we lived.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The day of our first video came – a Monday. It didn’t take us more than 15 minutes to set up the whole equipment on the studio exactly like the picture showed. The objects projected large shadows on the room, and the lights were set to slowly move on their own, so our interaction with the shadows was like the strangest sexy dance – but at least we weren’t standing still for half an hour pretending to fondle the same empty spot.

Despite thinking that it was wacky, Savannah was a professional and she diligently used the otherworldly condoms as requested. I used them as well, and for 35 minutes, we pretended to fuck shadows.

I felt utterly ridiculous, but being used to doing solo videos, I pretty much knew how to do it. The color of the lights and the outfits really helped set a soothing mood that made it all less shameful.

Savannah then turned off the cameras and looked at me.

“It wasn’t awful, was it?”

“It was okay”, I agreed. I could make a fool of myself for some good money.

“Do you want to shoot a second one and end this week early?”

Before I could reply, her phone buzzed loudly.

*From: <Unknown Number>: Remember, shoot twice a week. Separately.*

We stared at each other in confusion.

“Maybe there’s a mic hidden in the equipment?” I suggested. 

We searched the whole room but found nothing.

I didn’t think much about it. Rich people are controlling. They know things, always. The client knew when we were going to film the first video, and of course he figured we would consider doing everything on the same day instead of having to disassemble the set and reassembling it again.

I went about my day, and nothing strange happened. Savannah seemed much more alive because now she had time for her hobbies, and I was doing well enough to start sending my family some money, something I had wanted to do for a long time.

We were to send him the first video on the day we recorded the second and so on. On Thursday, Savannah told me the client loved our first video, and looked forward to the next. To get us a little more comfortable with our weird thing, we had some wine and put on jazz music.

This time things went smoothly, but I kept hearing some humming while we pretended to fuck the shadows. I was sure it wasn’t coming from the music.

I asked Savannah and she didn’t hear anything. “Maybe you’re a bit drunk? Slow down on the wine next time, home girl!”

For our video number 3, I was completely sober and asked Savannah to do it without music. She agreed, and in the total silence, I still heard the humming.

It was a humming that wasn’t there before, and it didn’t come from the light strobes either. I was so focused on it and intrigued that my face looked really unsexy and Savannah’s editor called to ask if there was an issue.

“She just keeps listening to some humming. Yeah, I’ll tell her to see a doctor. Think you can mostly show her from behind? Cool, you’re an angel!”

Savannah looked more worried about me than anything else, so I promised to see a doctor. Maybe something was wrong with my ear – even though something only felt off while we filmed the videos; at least now I could afford some high-quality healthcare.

Between the filming of videos 3 and 4, I got my ears checked, but they were perfectly normal. Savannah reiterated that it was totally cool if I wanted to give up on this freaky fetish-video thing and she would get another girl for that, no hard feelings.

But I didn’t feel like the videos were the problem. There was just this weird *thing* I couldn’t quite understand.

On video 4, Savannah was tipsy and seemed to be really enjoying herself. I felt a little guilty that she was clearly overcompensating for the fact that I was worried and gloomy on the previous video.

The humming evolved to whispers. And for the first time, I heard – no, it was more like understanding for the context, with the intuitive side of my brain – a few words.

*“I actually like this.”*

At last that’s what I foretold that the whispers said. It probably sounded more like *sfslsosls dlsowllss swowllls*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once again, I didn’t tell anyone. I was almost convinced that I was actually being crazy. It was just an eerie feeling because I was stripping to and groping empty spaces twice a week.

On the Friday after recording video 4, we got a new box with outfits. There was another photograph, instructing us to rearrange the lights and boxes to, I imagine, create different shapes with the shadows.

I couldn’t restrain myself this time.

“Savannah, don’t you think this pic looks exactly like your studio?”

“Yeah, that helps a lot, right?” she smiled, and then slowly realized what I meant, her smile withering. She grabbed the photo from my hand. “Oh, now that you said it, it’s quite alike. But of course no one broke into the house, right? I think that’s a standard room.”

But she sounded shaken.

I think that’s the reason why she completely forgot the otherworldly condom.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We made the preparations as usual; changed the setting as the photo instructed, dressed up, put on our wigs and make-up. 

The whispering immediately started, and for a moment I got lost in it, trying to understand. A buzzing sound, then another.

*“There’s food today.”*

*“It tastes good.”*

Then Savannah screamed.

I didn’t realize she wasn’t wearing the otherworldly condom either – not until I saw her groin covered by the blackest of blacks, then her legs disappearing into the darkness of the shadows.

Like she was involved by long and thick pieces of deep-black fabric, her torso and head disappeared too. She didn’t seem to be in pain, but in shock – everything was so quick and uncanny.

I reached out for her, but there was nothing there.

My hands grasped thin air.

I immediately turned off the light strobes, turned on the normal lights and moved all the boxes around. They were still hollow as ever and Savannah was nowhere to be found.

I then searched the whole house fruitlessly. 

It’s ludicrous to say that, but shadow-people took my friend.

I sat on the floor and cried, worried about Savannah and about what I would tell the police about her disappearance.

I was a mess, and decided to cancel my live-streaming that night for personal reasons.

As soon as I opened the browser, an e-mail notification popped on my screen.

*From: <*[*shadowfucker@\[redacted\].com*](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com)*>*

*It’s not your fault that your friend neglected my one rule.*

*I like you, Ayla. The editor tried to cut off your face from the last couple of videos, but I do realize you are accomplishing something I was never able to: learning the shadow-people language.*

*Keep working for me and all your financial concerns will be taken care of, especially regarding your teenage sister and her two children. I’ll deal with everything regarding Savannah as well.*

*Find me a new second girl for the videos, the cash and outfits will keep coming. It’s up to you to instruct her to always use the otherworldly condoms – I don’t mind feeding them*[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)",Entertainment
nosleep,"When I was a kid, my dad kept a second family in our basement.","Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds… but it was all I’d ever known.

I knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I’d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.

I knew that every morning, he’d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.

I knew that each Christmas, he’d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.

I knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.

I’ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young – maybe five – when I finally found the words to ask: “Mommy, why can’t I play with the people in the basement?”

My mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.

I’ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can’t quite explain.

“We don’t talk about them,” she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. “You don’t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.”

She paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, “Daddy needs them too.”

That night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn’t know that I knew, more shocked – frightened, even – to find that they didn’t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn’t want me to tell anyone at school – anyone at all, really.

After that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I’d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I’d always noticed that she was… distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that… as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I’d ruined my parents’ marriage.

But I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious – the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.

I wanted – *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.

Another change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know… there’s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.

To avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn’t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad’s car wasn’t in the garage and my mom’s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.

And then, I knocked.

It was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life’s greatest – and most terrifying – mystery.

I jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate… like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn’t any have time to waste.

My mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, “hi.”

“Hi.”

It was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.

“I-I’m Ricky. What’s your name?”

A long pause.

“Lila. My brother’s is Isaac, but he doesn’t talk so good. But he’s still little. Mommy says he’ll start talking when he’s ready.”

“There’s three of you down there?”

“Mhmm,” she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. “Daddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there’s four.”

My eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else… the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.

And like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to – *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn’t really know my dad, didn’t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila’s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?

And why wasn’t she allowed to come out of the basement?

Over the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her – she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn’t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.

And at home, I had Lila.

As we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.

The unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.

Lila lamented that she wasn’t allowed to go to school, that she couldn’t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most– homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.

She said she’d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn’t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.

I’m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually… I couldn’t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so naïve… I didn’t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.

I stopped trying.

I stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead… *compartmentalized*.

Confined to the basement of my own mind.

At home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I’d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I’d hear her scream. Sometimes I’d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I’d hear her crying – awful, painful sobs – while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.

Sometimes she… she would call out my name. I’ll never forgive myself for this – I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to – but I ignored her every time.

Worst of all, though, was when she started knocking.

I was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.

A quiet knock… but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.

My blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.

I hopped on my bike and didn’t come home until dinner was on the table.

That night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.

She wasn’t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom… all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I’d be greeted immediately by the knocking.

By then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn’t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila’s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn’t let on.

She didn’t stop.

Sleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and – most of all – terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend’s – now my *only* friend’s – house unannounced just to escape Lila’s knocking.

His parents clearly didn’t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me – broke *everything*.

A blow far more powerful than he could’ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.

“My mom says you’re a *bastard*, that your mom’s a *whore!*”

I had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.

I had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: “Mom… am I a bastard?”

I had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.

I had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.

I had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.

But, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally – *finally* – told me the truth about Lila, about Dad’s second family in the basement.

I was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.

Through choking sobs, she told me about my dad’s old family, the one he’d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they’d made, the one that gave her the best thing she’d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad’s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.

About how they couldn’t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless – “like a heavy backpack, mom?”

“Yes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.”

That Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he’d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn’t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.

Yet another difficult question: “but… why do they have to stay in the basement?”

I found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.

I was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn’t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn’t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn’t imagine doing what she did.

My dad’s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad’s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.

I don’t live in that house anymore… I’m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal – even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid – but it’s all I’ve ever known. I love them… all of them.

I still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations. And whenever I do visit, I take a moment to be grateful for the fact that when I knock on the front door, [Lila opens it](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

nosleep,"I've been a search and rescue diver for 12 years. We see a lot of strange and disgusting things, but what I saw last week has me questioning both my job and reality","I’ve been involved with water search and rescue for twelve years now. I’ve seen a lot of upsetting and even unexplainable things in my time, but those pale in comparison to what I saw recently. Water search and rescue is often a depressing job. When someone gets lost in a forest, they can still be found alive days later. But when we get a call, it’s almost always body recovery. People don’t last long in the water.

I can’t tell you exactly where, but I live in a northern territory known for its water sports. Fishing, kayaking, diving - whatever it is, our waters probably have a solid reputation for it. Despite that, this area isn’t some kind of resort. The waters here are cold and oftentimes vicious. Search and rescue operations here can be grueling and not many stick with it. There are a few older guys who have been doing it longer than me, but I’m one of the most experienced around.

Like I said before, this job is more body recovery than anything, especially here. We save more live moose from the water than live humans. And when we get a call about a missing child…well we’d be better off just giving our condolences. That’s just how the waters are here. Our small town has one of the highest drowning rates in the country. But we look anyway, and usually we find a body.

I’ve considered quitting many times in my career. Most people quit after their first recovery. In training, we try to emphasize just how much water can distort a corpse, but nothing can prepare you for the harsh reality. It’s not uncommon for us to find bodies bloated beyond recognition. Sometimes they barely even seem human. A lot of divers don’t last long after seeing something like that. But I continued to do it after all these years. I figured if I didn’t then no one would.

However, the things I saw last week have made me reconsider that decision.

I got the call around 11 A.M. A father had taken his ten-year-old son fly fishing. At one point, the father managed to stab a hook all the way through his finger. He went back up to his truck to get a first-aid kit. The boy was gone when he returned a few minutes later.

When I first heard the story, I hung my head in silence for a moment. It had been raining heavily for almost a month now, and the waters were running faster than ever. To make things worse, it was unusually cold for the season. A number of people had gone missing in recent weeks. Many of them had yet to be found. I had little hope of finding the boy alive.

Me and a couple of other divers were at the site where the boy went missing within an hour, and a larger search and rescue team located a few towns over was headed our way. We talked with the father and even searched the forest for a bit, hoping that he had just wandered off. But eventually we realized that we would have to begin searching in the river.

The moment I got in the water I knew the boy was gone. The current was worse than it had ever been, and even I had difficulty navigating the icy river. We looked for hours in the surrounding areas, and even expanded our search once the larger team had arrived. The boy was nowhere to be found.

I was surprised. I hadn’t expected to find him alive, but I had at least anticipated finding a body. However, there was no trace of him. The sun got low and the air grew colder. We were considering calling it off as nightfall approached and resuming the search the next day when I discovered something.

There’s a lot of creek beds around the river. Many of them have dried up as a result of encroaching vegetation or manmade efforts to divert the water. We usually don’t pay any attention to them. However, with all of the recent rain, I noticed that one of the larger creek beds had begun flowing again. A surprising amount of water crashed through it, easily enough to carry a young boy.

The creek ran directly across a bend in the river, connecting it at two points. I followed it and realized that the boy could be located outside of our initial search area. As I approached where the creek reconnected with the main river, I felt a sinking feeling in my gut.

There’s a place in the river where not even search and rescue divers are supposed to go. It’s known as Badwater. This area lies on one half of the river and runs for about 100 yards. It’s near a densely vegetated area, so we don’t often have to worry about people swimming there. But a lot of disappearances occur in the surrounding waters. Despite that, I’ve been warned not to dive there since I began doing search and rescue. Supposedly the undercurrent is so strong that even the most experienced swimmer would be swept away in an instant. “Don’t go near Badwater.” It was a mantra of the older divers.

The creek ended exactly in the center of the Badwater region. As I reached it, I stopped and chewed my lip thoughtfully. If I went back and reported this to the other divers, they would tell me to let it go. They wouldn’t let me dive there. But deep down I felt like the boy’s body must be tangled up in some weeds nearby. If only I could find it. I hated the idea of that kid being stuck down there, slowly bloating and rotting away while his parents sat at home wondering where their boy had gone.

Badwater didn’t seem to be that bad. I’d seen rougher waters before, but I knew looks could be deceiving. Just below the surface it could be flowing faster than I ever imagined. And I’d be swept away in an instant. Besides, I wasn’t supposed to dive alone. I almost turned back, but something made me stay. I stared into the river for a moment, thinking about the boy. Then I put on my gear and dropped into the icy waters.

The first thing I noticed was that the current actually seemed pretty weak. As a matter of fact, it was weaker than the rest of the river. The water was extremely deep there, and I could see only blackness below as I dove. I kicked deeper and deeper, thinking that the current might pick up lower down, but the opposite seemed to be true. The water was almost completely still.

I went even deeper until finally green shapes began to materialize in front of me. I thought I’d finally reached a bed of weeds. But, as I kicked lower, the truth came into full view. I felt vomit come up at the sight, an odd and dangerous sensation when you’re wearing a scuba mask.

Countless arms stuck up from the ground below. I thought I had come upon a trove of bodies, but the disgusting reality became even more apparent only a moment later. The arms grew directly into the ground. They even had roots that spread out from the base. It was as if someone had cut off hundreds of arms at the shoulder and planted them there. They were green, and I watched as they clutched at the water around them. They varied in size and seemingly age. Grotesque baby hands sprouted near the bottom, and they opened and closed their fists hungrily.

It was then that I saw the boy. His eyes stared sightlessly ahead as those grotesque arms pulled his dead body downward. It seemed they had just gotten ahold of him. The arms yanked at him, burying him in the surrounding sediment. They pushed and writhed and squirmed until he was securely buried up to the chest. I stared in mesmerized horror.

That was when the other bodies came into focus. There must have been at least four more, all in varying stages of decay. Some were bloated beyond recognition, only bulky, white masses that protruded loosely from the riverbed. I once again felt vomit rising in my throat and swallowed it back down. The fucking hands were feeding off the bodies, using them as fertilizer.

The moment I clambered out of the water I tore my mask off and retched. I couldn’t stop thinking about those disgusting bodies, those grasping hands. They were like some sort of carnivorous plant, yet they were so humanoid. I vomited again at the thought.

I frantically ran back to our base camp and pulled one of the other divers aside. Moose was the most experienced person on our team. He’d been diving for over twenty years ever since moving here. I told him about what I saw. When I  finished, he stared at me in cold silence.

“I told you never to go near Badwater.” His voice contained an iciness that even his thick Louisiana accent couldn’t conceal.

“That’s what you’re concerned about?” I was incredulous.

He placed a hand on my shoulder and squeezed tightly. “Don’t tell anyone else about this. If the others find out you went into Badwater…” He trailed off and thought for a moment. “Well, it won’t be good.” He shook his head like a disappointed father.

“But what about those things?” I tried to keep my voice down, hoping no one would hear us. “How many people have died because of those fucking things?”

“Shut up.” Moose said. “We have an agreement. There’s a reason they only grow in Badwater. Don’t fuck this up.”

I started to say something, but the words caught in my throat. He was keeping something from me.

He sighed and I saw something like sadness behind his eyes. “Sometimes you have to decide between lesser and greater evils. Even the best possible decisions can still keep you up at night.” He went silent for a moment and only stared at me. “Don’t tell anyone about this. Maybe one day you’ll understand.”

He walked away after that and called off the day’s search. Despite what I’d told him, we continued to search for the next two days. By the third day we called it off completely and gave our condolences to the family.

I don’t know what the fuck is happening. Moose has been acting different towards me ever since. There’s an iciness to him, but every now and then he’ll shoot me a knowing glance, like we’re in on some secret together. I’ve noticed the other older divers acting strangely too. What did he mean by agreement? What the fuck were those arm things? I’m considering quitting and moving away from here. I can’t live with the knowledge that those things are down there, slowly feeding off the body of a young boy among countless [others](https://reddit.com/r/travisliebert).

nosleep,A Talking Crow Taught me to Fly,"I used to look out the rusted iron bars of my window and dream about being a bird.

The chain that shackled me to my bed was just long enough to reach the windowsill, and so every night after my father would visit my room I would lie awake and wait for the first rays of light to creep over the horizon, then walk over to my window to listen to the morning’s first few notes of birdsong.

Their melodies were so beautiful, I knew that they must have been singing about places far away and wonderful, about sailing on the wind through endless blue skies, looking down at the treetops that dotted the land below.

Then, one morning as I lay in bed, something impossible happened. I had fallen asleep the night before, and would have missed my morning birdsong but for a tapping on my window. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to see a crow sitting outside on the sill, tapping my window with his beak.

I crept over to the window and smiled at the bird.

“Hello, Mr. Crow,” I said.

“Hello little girl,” said the crow.

I stood there dumbfounded for a moment, not knowing what to say. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I forced myself to speak.

“You know how to talk?” I said.

“All birds know how to talk,” he replied. “It’s just that not all humans know how to listen.”

I pushed my window open a crack until it hit against the bars. The bird cocked its head in curiosity.

“Why are you in a cage?” it asked.

“I think it’s my destiny,” I said. “It’s always been this way.”

“You look rather thin,” replied the crow. “Would you like something to eat?”

My stomach gave a weak growl.

“Yes,” I said. “That would be wonderful.”

Without another word the crow took flight. A few minutes later he returned with a small branch of figs. The crow watched me as I greedily devoured the fruit. After I had finished he stared at me for a moment before speaking again.

“I didn’t know they put people in cages,” he said. “Do you think they mistook you for a bird?”

“I don’t think so Mr. Crow,” I said.

We whiled away the rest of that day talking. The crow told me all about what it was like to fly, how there was no better feeling in the world. He told me about the far away lands he had visited when he was a young bird and could still make the journey north with the changing of the seasons. Finally, evening came and the crow said that he had to go. The next morning he was back, however, with two more branches of figs.

I thanked him for his generosity, and we talked another day away. That day he even sang me a song. He didn’t have a voice for singing, but I thought his song was beautiful anyway.

We passed the entire fall that way, and the bird’s visits became the only bright spot in my life. He brought me not only figs, but cherries and walnuts too\-\-anything small enough for him to carry.

Soon, however, winter came, and with it the frosts that destroyed the figs and cherries that the crow had used to bring me. His gifts became fewer and fewer, and I could tell from his tired voice that he was flying farther and farther away to get them.

One morning, when the first snows of winter had fallen, the crow asked me a question.

“What would you do to leave this place?” he asked, cocking his head to the side.

I thought for a moment, but I wasn’t sure how to answer. Finally, I told the truth.

“I would do anything to leave this place,” I said. “Anything at all.”

The crow solemnly nodded and said, “The frost isn’t the only thing that winter brings.”

He flapped his wings once and jumped from the windowsill, and I didn’t see him for three days. I began to fall into a deep depression. Every morning I would still listen to the birdsong, but it sounded forlorn and empty without my friend there to listen with me.

The morning after the third day my crow friend returned. It was so beautiful that day; the sun had come out from behind the clouds to melt the snow\-\-one of the last green days before winter came in earnest. As the shadow passed over the valley in which we lived, I first mistook it for a storm cloud, but then I heard the sound. It was loud enough to crack the sky, but it wasn’t thunder\-\-it was birds.

Thousands upon thousands of them descended on our house. A whirling storm of beating wings and shrieking caws, they crashed into the walls and windows, pecking at them with wild ferocity. The house shook under their assault, and their calls were so loud that I didn’t even hear the windows breaking.

They were not so loud, however, that I could not hear my father scream. It was over in a matter of minutes, and the key to my shackles slipped under the door. I rushed over and picked it up with trembling hands, sliding it into the metal cuff around my ankle and turning it.

The cuff came loose with a heavy click, and for the first time I was free.

The key to the door slipped under the jamb as well, and I opened the door to the rest of the house. The place had been all but destroyed. There was splintered wood and broken glass everywhere, and in the center of the living room was what remained of my father\-\-a pile of bloodstained feathers.

The birds had all flown off, but Mr. Crow sat on top of the living room fireplace, regarding me with a curious look.

“Now you can fly free, little girl,” he said. “No more cages for you.”

“Thank you, Mr. Crow,” I said. “Will you come with me?”

Mr. Crow shook his head.

“I am an old bird,” he said. “And my journey is coming to a close. But yours is just beginning.”

Mr. Crow flapped his wings and took flight, and I never saw him again. As I stepped out of the front door my bare feet touched the grass for the very first time, and I could smell the flowers on the breeze as it drifted over me.

At that moment, though my feet were firmly on the ground, my heart was soaring through endless blue sky, far above the world that I had left behind.

I still wake up every morning to hear the birds sing, and when the first few notes break the silence of the early dawn, I think of Mr. Crow and smile.

nosleep,I work at NASA. We made alien contact yesterday.,"Part 2 - https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c521t1/i_work_at_nasa_we_made_alien_contact_last_week/

I can't tell you who I am, and I can't tell you the name of the program, but what I can tell you is that if what they say is true, we're in trouble.

Now, we didn't make contact in the way you would think we would. We didn't beam out an episode of The Office towards Andromeda and hear back from alien critics. And we definitely didn't meet them face to face. We found another way to communicate. Something, apparently ancient humans had figured out as well.

There are countless dilapidated ancient structures around the world, and some of them, not all, but some, were communication arrays. At least a handful on each continent. I'm sure you'll be able to think of a few after I describe what we did.

We've been working on this technology for a while. There has been a long standing theory that sound has a much larger part in the universe than just being random vibrations. That the universe is simply a bunch of vibrations and sound, and if you find a way to manipulate those vibrations properly, you could do things that seem impossible. We proved that yesterday. 

By creating an extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY, precise echo chamber, and playing certain frequencies into it, at precisely the right volumes, and the exact right timings, we broke some sort of barrier.

Nothing really happened, visually at least. We had run countless tests like these with tiny, minute differences, and this one seemed pretty mundane. There was a slight unnatural thrumming, the glass between us and the echo chamber shook in regular intervals as if we were playing a bass heavy song too loudly. The first thing that tipped us off that something was happening was that once we turned the speakers off, the thrumming didn't stop. My three coworkers and I could all feel this thrumming in out chests still, kind of like being next to a very loud drum. We talked for a moment, before we all fell silent.

There was something else now. It wasn't a voice. It was, some sort of, intellegent vibration. I can't explain it. It was like a voice was inside my chest, but it wasn't speaking, I could just feel what it was saying. My cohorts and I debated on the exact wording afterwards, but we all agreed on the overall messages each time. 

Like I said, they weren't really talking, so I'll do my best to phrase it in ways that get across what they said, in the way they ""said"" it. 

""Wooooaaaahhh, you guys are back?"" Is what I felt in my chest. My colleagues and I stared at each other in utter confusion. One of the spoke up. ""Hello?"" He asked hesitantly. There was a silence for a moment, before the thrumming spoke back. ""I think I have it set right now, say that again?""

""Hello?"" I repeated back to it in place of the other scientist. 

""Yep, there it is."" He said quickly. ""You guys figured it out again! That's crazy!"" It exclaimed. This wasn't what I was thinking the first human/alien conversation was going to go. I wasn't even sure that this was first contact at this point though. ""Who is this? What is this?"" I asked loudly into the open air of our control room.

""I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give you details like who we are, but, what this is, is the ultimate form of communication in our universe. Your ancestors figured it out briefly too."" With some quick deduction on how it was wording things, I think each of us figured out what we were talking to was alien in origin around the same time.

""Where are you from?"" I asked. ""You have to be close."" Hell, with the way we were talking back and forth, they had to be REALLY close. It takes communications to Mars a few minutes to get there, just because that's as fast as light is. If we were talking this quickly back and forth they basically had to be on Earth.

""I guess you wouldn't know. We didn't tell your ancestors. We didn't think they'd get it. Let me do some math real quick."" It was about a minute before it spoke again. ""What you see as your observable universe, thats not the whole universe. Not even close. Multiply that by about 15, and thats about how far we are away. And theres a lot past that."" 

We all looked at each other. It was speaking utter bullshit to us now. That was impossible, we'd never be able to communicate, ever. Physically impossible. We explained that to the chest-voice, and we were met by an equal level of confusion. ""Why are you still using light as a yardstick?"" It asked incredulously. Suddenly, its voice grew slightly dire. ""You're still not advanced enough. You don't even know."" 

""Know what?"" One of my friends asked.

""You are dead center in the Life Abyss. There is no life on any planet around you, for more than ten of your observable universes around you in any direction. Its a universal mystery how you're even alive."" It spoke grimly. Never in my life had I felt smaller, more insignificant and more alone. It continued. 

""And there is a reason for that.""",Entertainment
nosleep,I’m a Firewatcher. I found another Firewatcher’s unsettling journal at my new station.,"**I am a firewatcher. Upon moving in to my station, I found the following pages typed on my desk. I am not the author of the following. I am transcribing exactly what I found, dated 1989:**

---------------

----

I’ve been located here for 185 days, according to my calendar. I’m stationed up in the northwest of the United States with two other guys—Clark and Thomas. 

185 days. That’s five days longer than our stint here should’ve been. Normally, they rotate us out every 180 days. We were supposed to be picked up by Helicopter 5 days ago.

I started writing this logbook, journal, whatever, because we’re overdue for evac. Or so we think. Maybe we messed up the calendar somehow.

Our main radio stopped working on day 179.

“Get up! There’s smoke.”

Bleary-eyed, I saw Clark standing over my bunk. I could see the orange slits of light reflecting on his torso, signaling to me it was the early morning.

“Teddy! Smoke!”

“Smoke? Huh?” I said, still half-delirious.

“Yes, smoke. A really small stream of it maybe a mile southeast.” His eyes were wide and brighter than the sunlight on his uniform.

I pulled myself out of the bottom bunk and headed towards the window. I didn’t even need my binoculars to see the small sliver of smoke creating a shadow in the early sun’s light. In 185 days, it’s only the second time we’ve seen a potential fire.

For those who don’t know what a fire watchtower looks like, it’s basically a wooden cabin elevated about 100 feet in the air. Ours has a staircase that wraps around the structure beneath the cabin. I’m pretty sure other towers use ladders, but that’s beside the point.

Clark and I bunk up in the watch tower. We have a little kitchen, our bunk bed, and a 360-degree view of nothing but woods. Thomas sleeps in a tiny little cabin at the base of our tower, which is also where our main office is. ‘Office’ may be too loose of a term. It’s one desk and a typewriter used for typing out reports of what we see out here.

I rubbed my eyes and looked over to Clark, “alright, let’s go check it out.”

“No way, Teddy. No way,” he replied immediately.

Clark has been afraid to go past the outhouse since day 180 passed. He’s afraid a helicopter will come, and he’ll miss his chance to be rescued.

‘Rescued’ Clark would say. But are we in danger? Did we miscalculate the number of days we’ve been out here? We still have plenty of food. Did they forget about us? Has the apocalypse come and gone and we don’t know because we’ve been isolated?

“Okay, fine,” I agreed, “Radio down to Thomas and let him know. He should be up.”

Our main radio back to base isn’t getting a sign of life from anywhere. And if it isn’t receiving from anywhere, we assume we aren’t being heard from anywhere. Luckily, we still have our own walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.

Clark took out his walkie.

“Tom, there’s some smoke about a mile southeast. Can you go check it out?”

A few seconds passed before Thomas responded.

“After I finish wiping my ass I’ll be on my way. Unless you wanna help me with that Clarky.”

Thomas, the oldest of us, is always picking on Clark, the youngest. He doesn’t really dislike Clark. He is just easy to pick on. He’s a twenty-three-year-old college dropout. I think he studied accounting or finance or something on his parents’ dime. I don’t think he left college to be a professional firewatcher. No, I think he left to come out in the wilderness, be alone, and take a retrospective look at his life to decide what he really wants.

You only sign up for 180 days of isolation if you’re crazy, or if you want to get away from something. I’m not sure which category Thomas falls is. He’s a cryptic, brute of a man. His picture is probably in the dictionary next to “lumberjack.” He’s pretty quiet unless he has a joke to tell or something important to say. Either way, when he opens his mouth, I listen.

As for me, it’s not important why I’m out here.

“Headed out now,” Thomas radioed. 

Clark and I watched Thomas start his trek into the tree line until we could no longer see him.

Clark cocked his head towards mine.

“Teddy,” he said to me, “Thomas has been acting... different. Weird.”

I didn’t expect him to be so blunt. But I had noticed. I knew Clark had noticed, but this was the first time we spoke about it.

“I know.”

“He doesn’t seem to be bothered that we are stuck out here.”

“We don’t *know* if we are stuck out here. We could’ve scratched off the dates wrong. You know—we thought we didn’t scratch the day off yet but we really did, so we accidentally scratch the next day too.”

“I guess,” Clark said softly. I knew what he was going to say next.

“At night though—”

“Shut it, Clark.”

“C’mon Teddy! It’s fucked up. He’s fine during the day and then just, just changes. Does he have some type’a illness? It happened so sudden!”

“Maybe he does! So what if the guy goes out at night to stare at trees?”

“Trees? Stare at trees?”

“I know you’ve seen it. He goes out near the tree line and stands there for a while looking out. Sometimes hours. Maybe he does have a screw loose, and maybe he shouldn’t be out here. But I don’t think it’s the best idea to bring it up to him when we are trapped here with him, especially if he *is* insane.”

Silence fell between us before Clark responded.

“I didn’t know he stares out at the forest,” he said to me in a soft voice and eyes wider than when he woke me up this morning.

“Oh—wait, what? What were you going to say?”

“At—At night,” he stammered, “he comes up the stairs.”

I looked over to our half-open door leading out to the staircase, letting a cool breeze in.

“Wh—what do you—what?”

“He comes up the stairs, and, and just, looks at us. Stares at us.”

------------

Thomas left to go check out the smoke about an hour ago. It seems to have vanished, so I figure he handled it. 

Clark spends his days using our walkie talkies, trying every station possible to alert anyone nearby.

I just watch the forest.

---------------

It’s 11:30 PM. Thomas isn’t back. He left at about 7 AM. He hasn’t answered his radio.

Tomorrow will be day 186. We do not know if Thomas is okay, and one of us will most likely have to check the woods tomorrow—and since Clark is chicken-shit, it'll end up being me.

More disturbing though, is something Clark told me a few minutes ago—the reason I went back to the office to type this.

I was leaned back in my swivel chair, spinning slowly, making sure there were no lights or fires in the dark expanse of trees, and wondering where Thomas was. He must’ve been hurt. Even if he was lost, he’d reply on his walkie. We always answer our walkies. They’re with us at all times, even when we are shitting or showering.

Clark stopped my chair mid-spin and mid-thought. Before I could protest, he spoke.

“Listen. I need to tell you something I’ve been thinking about recently. It’s eating away at me.”

I wondered if it had to do with Thomas.

“Okay,” I said. “I’m all ears.”

“It’s going to sound crazy,” he warned.

“I bet I’ve heard crazier.”

He took a long, yet stuttered inhale, then spoke. “I don’t remember coming out here.”

My facial expression didn’t change, and it looked like he was waiting for a reaction, so he repeated.

“I don’t remember coming out here. Do you? Do you remember applying for this job? Do you remember being interviewed? Or being flown out here?”

At first, I was almost amused. 

Then as he asked those questions, I froze.

I didn’t remember.

He continued, “You know how I said I decided to leave college? Well, now that I’m thinking about it harder, I don’t know if I did. I mean I must have, right? To be out here? I must have. But all I can remember is my last day of class for the semester, and then I was here. I don’t remember anything between coming home after class and meeting you and Thomas.”

I was listening, but it probably didn’t show. I was still motionless.

I couldn’t remember. I tried and am still trying.

Thomas is missing.

Clark and I are losing our minds or—or something else.

Either way, I can’t explain it yet.

nosleep,The Deepest Part of the Ocean is Not Empty,"*The Ocean has its silent caves,*

*Deep Deep, quiet, and alone;*

*Though there be fury on the waves,*

*Beneath them there is none.*


---


Over the course of the last few weeks of training I’d memorized nearly every facet of the *Tuscany* - every dial and every readout and every knob and screen and nuance of structure - and the quality of the personal submarine’s craftsmanship never ceased to astound me. It was a remarkable feat of engineering, this little beast; designed with such care that even the equipment on the hull could withstand more water pressure than the sea could muster up at any achievable depth. It was my Pegasus. My Trojan Horse; my very own *Apollo 11* - and inside this matrix of layered syntactic foam I would follow the ballasts to the gratuitous and unexplored depths of Higgin’s Maw. 


I began the separation sequence, and the deep-diver fell away from the escort and dipped beneath the surface of the Pacific with silence and grace and a few knots of speed, and then I was consumed in a whole new world - albeit one I’d frequented - that of the sea. Schools of fish swam on by me, and when their cloud passed through a sunbeam it glinted silver, and beneath them swam rays that rolled their wings to the beat of the current, and out in the rocks crawled the crustaceans and sat the plant life that spruced up all the white-washed stones there like holiday ornaments. But I had an appointment to keep, and the oxygen tank was a demanding clock, so I dove right on past the old reef and out into the open waters where the seabed couldn’t be seen for many, many miles yet. 


*”The Maw,” Reuben had said. “Fifty thousand feet below the surface, Booker. Fifty* thousand. *Do you know what that means?”*


*”Means its a whole hell of a lot deeper down than the Challenger Abyss.”*


*He’d nodded at that. “Are you ready to make history?”*


Was I? I thought I was. I’d prepared for this lonely dive and nothing else, for some years now. It was the culmination of a lifetime of work and study in the field, and so tight was its grip on my mind that I often dreamt of it in my sleep; of what I’d find at the bottom, and what it would mean. *And what monstrous things might take offense to my presence there.*


No. *No.* I shoved that thought aside. *Tuscany* was all the protection I needed in that regard; it offered technology on the bleeding edge in lieu of a heavy hull, and that was enough to withstand enough water pressure to crush bones beneath skin and inches of steel. What animal had jaws more powerful than the ocean itself at fathom?


So I hit the thrusters, and down I went, like a bullet to the pitch. I eyed the depth meter as much as I did the sea. One hundred feet. Two hundred. Sharks and turtles and uncountable fish swept past me. Three hundred feet. Five hundred feet. Seven hundred. A thousand. Twelve-fifty - *the inversed height of the Empire State building.* Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. 


The water began to blur and grain up and darken as the sunlight struggled to push on through. Two thousand. Twenty five. Three thousand. Thirty two - *where the light no longer shines.* 


And soon all the light I had to spill glow to the path ahead and down, were the lights of the *Tuscany.*


I continued the descent for hours. The pressure meter ticked up in spasmic bursts, but up it went, up, up, up, soon ticking past the point where the weight of the sea would’ve crushed the steel of another vessel. One mile down. One point three. One point six - *where even Sperm Whales hit their lowest dive.* I could now claim with confidence that no mammal on earth was as deep down at that very moment as myself. And still I dove. Two miles. Two point one. Two point two. 


The water was as black as space now, except for where the lights of the *Tuscany* pierced through it, and the thickness of the fluid made it look like ink or oil or some kind of alien sludge that smeared up against the reinforced windows and slimed its way across the hull. Things were tight down here, despite the vastness of it all, yet still I dove. 


Thirteen thousand feet. *The Abyssal zone. Pressure stands at 11,000 psi.* I saw an Angler float by, and it was startled by the sheer volume of light spread by the *Tuscany* that dwarfed its own bioluminescent glow. It swam away, and I dove further. Fifteen thousand feet. Three miles. Three point one. 


*Now things get interesting.*


Mankind had visited these depths almost infrequently enough to count the expeditions on a single pair of hands. I was now ranked among an illustrious few explorers, and although I wasn’t the first to hit these marks, I’d hit the deepest one yet before this journey was over. I was determined and I was capable. So I checked the depth chart. *Sixteen thousand, two hundred eighty one point four feet.* Nearly halfway to the world record. The *Tuscany* continued its dive.


Twenty thousand feet down. *The Hadal zone. Pressure here is eleven hundred times what it is at the surface.* Twenty two thousand feet. Twenty six. Twenty nine thousand - *The height of Mount Everest.* Thirty. Thirty point five. Thirty one - *the same distance from the surface as a commercial airliner at the peak of its flight.* 


The Challenger Deep, what had previously been the lowest recorded place on the seabed, sat at roughly 36,000 feet below the surface, in the depths of the Mariana Trench. No light from the sun had ever come close, and to the best accounts life existed there, but only sparsely, and the pressure is unspeakable. 


But I was going somewhere vastly deeper, even, than that. 


*”All we know is we found a canyon,” Reuben had said. “Dwarfs the Grand - sitting dead center in the Pacific seabed. ‘Bout twelve hundred kilometers west of Hawaii, and another nine hundred south, and, near as we can figure, some fifty thousand feet straight on down.”*


Thirty six thousand feet. I was now tied for the world record. 


“*Fifty thousand feet?! Why the hell are we just now seeing it?”*


Thirty six five. I did it. My heartbeat swept up to a faster rhythm. I was officially a world record holder; no human being in recorded history had been as deep below the surface as I was at that very moment. 


*“New seabed scanning technology helped. Gave us a more detailed topographical map of the hydrosphere than we’ve ever had before, and once we got back the results, we took a look, and there it was. Just waiting for us. Inviting us down.”*


Thirty seven. 


*”So what’s down there?*


Thirty seven three.


*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* 


Thirty seven nine.


*”I suppose not.”*


Thirty eight.


Thirty eight five.

*The awful spirits of the deep*

*Hold their communion there;*

*And there are those for whom we weep,*

*The young, the bright, the fair.*


Higgin’s Maw, according to the best information available to me at the time of departure, is a pit, roughly a full kilometer across. It begins at approximately forty six thousand feet below the surface and is estimated to bottom out at Higgin’s Deep, a small valley that sits at its base, some five thousand additional feet below that. The Maw is the largest and deepest such formation in the hydrosphere, and yet its dimensions and location are the only things concretely known about it. That, of course, is where myself, and where the *Tuscany,* come in.


Forty three thousand feet down. I hit the floodlights underneath the *Tuscany,* and the glow washed over an alien landscape that likely hadn’t seen light in over a billion years. There were mountains here - *mountains* - ones that rivaled the Alps, and wild arches and plateaus that stretched far off to a murky horizon before being shrouded by seawater. 


I even saw *life* down here in the depths. A squid-like thing of simply monstrous size swam on by my boat. It stopped for a moment, and during that moment I thought it might take offense to me, but after looking hard at the *Tuscany* and brushing a tentacle down the port side it swam off in search of other things. 


“Atta girl.”


I descended further. 


Forty four thousand feet. Forty five. 


And then, all of a sudden, there it was. *The Maw.*


My mouth hung by the jaw as the sheer scope of the beast came into view. It was a breathtaking sight to behold; a monstrously large and equally dark hole in the crust of the earth that plummeted to inconceivable fathoms. I descended a bit further - forty five five, forty six thousand feet - and *Tuscany* fell into its yawn. Somehow things were even blacker in the depths of the thing, even though sunlight had long since been blotted out. 


Forty six five. Forty seven. Forty seven two.


I began to become aware of a low current pulling me downward. It wasn’t particularly powerful, but it was unexpected and it was therefore alarming. And yet I couldn’t bear to pull myself back up. Not yet - *I’ll turn around if it gets bad* - so down I went, deeper and deeper and deeper still into the cavern. 


Forty eight thousand feet. Forty eight five. Forty nine. Forty nine one. 


And then I saw it. A glow. 


I squinted and dimmed my lights to confirm the intuition. *What in the name of God…?* It was there indeed, a dim reddish-purple, then green, then purple again, and then blue, floating on a mist of current some few thousand feet down. I resumed the dive to chase it. Forty nine five. Forty nine seven. Forty nine nine. The glow, whatever it was, was getting deeper, and wider, and brighter. Soon it filled up the whole path down and ahead. I dimmed the *Tuscany’s* under-lights to their lowest setting, and by fifty thousand feet I could see that the glow was coming from somewhere not directly beneath me, but off to the left and around a wide corner. 


*This cave isn’t a straight pit.* And sure enough, the hole bottomed out here, and then opened up to its left. 


*Holy God. Holy* God.


It was a cavern chamber, at least a full kilometer up and deep and side to side and across, and only the enormity of its radius maintained the darkness of it despite the presence of thousands of floating bioluminescent pods that pulsed purple and green and blue and red and dimmed in the interim. I took the *Tuscany* in deeper, and her cameras whirred to life. 


---


*Calmly the wearied seamen rest*

*Beneath their own blue sea.*

*The ocean solitudes are blest,*

*For there is purity.*


The cavern became darker still when the pods faded into the water behind the ship. But there were more things to be seen here than rocks. *Tuscany,* about a quarter hour after entering the chamber, soon floated on by a bizarrely rope-like plant of utterly impossible size; one that appeared to stretch nearly across the height of the cave and grew wider at the base, although the bottom of it was shrouded in blackness. I took the submarine in for a closer inspection, and hit her lights to their fullest setting. 


*Clack.* 


My heartbeat slammed. There were suction cups on it. Each one as big as the *Tuscany* herself, and they writhed and pulsed across and down the full length of what was now very clearly a *tentacle.* In a panic I shoved *Tuscany* back and away from the thing, but when I tried to turn her around, the base of the hull collided with the beast and stuck fast to one of the cups. I gunned the thrusters and could hear a wet tearing sound as the machine ripped itself free from the cup’s grasp. 


But then the tentacle came to life. It whipped and whirled and smacked around the cavern, and pressed itself to the roof, and then it fell down, deep beyond where the darkness blanketed the floor. 


“C’mon, baby.” I hit the thrusters again, and *Tuscany* rocketed off the way it came, through the darkness and off towards the pods, whose glow I hoped would afford me an opportunity to shut the lights off the ship and make my escape. 


If I were so lucky. 


But very soon I began to hear and *feel* the movement of something unspeakably *titanic* rolling across the floor of the chamber. It rumbled and thundered, and shuddered and shook, and soon clouds of dirt and rock flew up out of the black pitch and blanketed the view forward and I could hear boulders smack against the ceiling of the cave before sinking again to where they'd been. 


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*


“F-fuck!!” The sound had erupted across the entire breadth of the cave at once. My eardrums nearly burst and likely would have, had it not been for muffling of the explosion provided by the walls of the *Tuscany.* The submarine shook, too, but she held up her integrity well enough to for me to fly on past the floating pods, some of which were now knocked about on their sides and rolling, and back towards the yawning mouth of the tunnel that would take me back out into the open deep s-


*SMACK!!*


The *Tuscany* buckled and rolled with an impact. The Tentacle, I realized, had shot up from the ground and hit the bottom of the ship between her ballasts, but luckily it knocked her with force up towards the tunnel. I rolled *Tuscany* with the hit and managed to regain some control, and I boosted the thrusters into the turn and up again, now back into the Maw. Then I began to climb. 


Fifty two thousand feet. Fifty one five. Fifty one. 


*”So what’s down there?*


“Come on, baby. Come on. Don’t you fail me now. Don’t you *fucking* fail me now.”


*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* 


Fifty point five. Fifty. Forty nine nine. Forty nine six. *Tuscany* ascended with panicked speed, and all the while she did it I could feel the rumbling of the Tentacle’s pursuit in the walls of the Pit. It smashed its way on through the tunnel, and whipped and thrashed, but *Tuscany* was too quick a runner. *Forty seven five. Forty seven. Forty six eight. Forty six four. Forty six thousand feet and climbing high.* 


*”I suppose not.”*


*Tuscany* burst out of the Maw and was about to rocket straight on back up to the surface, but then the Tentacle flew out beside her nearly smashed in her front window. I bent the controls to the edge of their set-casing, and *Tuscany* tanked to the left and up a bit and missed the ground by inches. I hit the lights again to navigate the labyrinth of rocks as I struggled to remount the climb. 


But in the light of the ship I saw it; these weren’t rocks after all - *they were other ships.* Massive vessels, Imperial warships from ages past, bent and crooked and broken at the bottom of the sea, pulled down here by whatever it was that now threw its back to my devouring. 


The Tentacle smashed along behind me. Mainmasts and battlements and flat-decks and rusted iron and wooden boat hulls were splintered up and tossed to the winds of the sea, never again to reconvene. I took *Tuscany* through this nautical graveyard with far, far too much speed for my safety. Under ship towers we went, and through cannon mounts and past the blades of dead engines and around upended rudders. 


The cacophony of my flight and the destructive path set by my hunter awoke the life in the place. Fish washed out of holes, and cabins, and captain’s quarters and deep-deck stair flights and soon joined me in my effort to escape. 


But it seemed there was no escape to be found here. The entire ground for countless miles shook and rumbled with seismic force. It was thunderously loud, and it picked up speed and violence with time. *Tuscany* finally flew up to miss a splintered crow's nest atop the mast by less than a foot, and finally used that directed momentum to put away distance between the seabed and herself with as many knots of speed as her thrusters would allow without bursting from the effort. The depth chart began to rise. 


*Forty five nine. Forty five two. Forty five thousand feet. Forty four eight.*


“Come on, you motherf-”


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*


The water itself seemed to shift with the sound. And then, out of nowhere, *Tuscany* was no longer the only thing spilling light to the Abyss; an orange glow flashed across the sea and for an instant illuminated nearly the entirety of its vastness. Then it blinked, and then flicked on again and stayed active. I shut off *Tuscany’s* lights to preserve every molecule of power for the ascent. 


*Forty four two. Forty four. Forty three seven.*


Beside me in the glow I could make out other creatures retreating, too. Ones of spectacular size, again, that mankind had never catalogued and that I, sadly, would not have time at all to study. There were city-bus sized manta ray shaped things, wrapped up in clouded wisps of transparent jelly, and even that squid the size of a building, all flying upwards in a mass panic. I led the charge. 


*Forty three one. Forty two eight. Forty two three. Forty two.*


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*


I looked behind me and down through the rear window. The Maw had moved. It was alive. *God almighty. I was in the Leviathan’s throat. I was in its fucking throat!* I saw its Tentacle tongue lash out of the Maw and collect enough fish to feed a small town. *Tuscany* rocketed ever upwards as the Leviathan whipped even larger Tentacles behind it and gained speed with the force of a hurricane. 


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*


The Leviathan opened its Maw yet again and spewed forth its tentacle tongue, and with it it whipped up several Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water into a gale-force maelstrom. The Mammoth Squid was caught in its fury, I saw, and then it vanished into the pit forever when the Maw snapped shut with a thunderous, echoing *snap.* 


*Tuscany,* meanwhile, continued to rocket upwards, and managed to escape the whirlpool by a foot. 


*Thirty nine five. Thirty nine. Thirty eight seven. Thirty eight two. Thirty eight thousand feet, and climbing.*


But the Leviathan pursued me relentlessly, riding on the flood of its own current. Its tentacles - each dozens of feet across and a mile long, beat the water back and tried to gain speed for their host. 


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*


*Thirty seven five. Thirty seven. Thirty six four.* 


*Tuscany* had proved her worth with speed, and the pressure gauge now fell in jumps. It remained in the red and would for some time, but it was falling steadily, even as the depth chart rose. 


*Twenty nine thousand feet. Twenty eight three. Twenty seven five.*


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!*


But the Leviathan hadn't given up the chase. Not yet. I could *feel* it doubling its efforts. The displaced water rocked the *Tuscany* and she buckled and rolled in the synthetic current. Then I heard the Maw open up behind me and the water begin to whip and swirl itself into a frenzy by the oceanload. I punched the thrusters to breaking point. 


“Come *on!!*” The encasing syntactic foam was pressed to its limits; the reinforced glass began to chip every so very slightly, but the chips broke into cracks and those cracks began to crawl across the width of the windows. I checked the gauges. Twenty thousand feet. Nineteen eight. Nineteen four. Nineteen three. The ascent was slowing. *Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Please God. Be with me now. Be w-*


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*


In the orange glow of the Levianthan’s eyes I could see how quickly the water was slipping by *Tuscany* and getting swept up into the maelstrom. The submarine began to sway port to starboard and shudder and shake. *Seventeen four. Seventeen thousand. Sixteen nine. Sixteen three. Sixteen one. Sixteen thousand.*


I watched the gauge with a nauseating desperation. 


*Fifteen nine five. Fifteen nine two.*


I could feel her slowing to a crawl. *Come on. Come on. Come on!*


*Fifteen nine two five. Fifteen nine four. Fifteen nine six. 


“Shit!!” And that was it; *Tuscany* was caught, and no sooner did the depth chart begin to slip then did I feel the whole submarine lose all sense of control and tumble backwards and around. I was thrown out of my seat and smacked my nose against the roof of the pilot sphere. Blood exploded, and it drenched my shirt and sprayed the glass and the entirety of the control set. 


I grabbed my face and began to apply pressure to slow the blood loss, but *Tuscany* again flipped ballast over ballast to starboard in the whirlpool and spilled me into the hatch ladder. I felt my shoulder dislocate and my kneecap smack into the bottom rung. My head swam, and still *Tuscany* tumbled backwards. The cracks on the windows spread faster. 


*Sixteen three. Sixteen four.*


I could *smell* the inside of the Maw though the hull of the ship. 


But then, all at once and not a moment too soon, I got an idea. It wasn’t a particularly good one, but hell if it wasn’t better than nothing - I managed to limp and tumble my way to the controls and grip the handles as the ship rolled. *Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait…*


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*


*Now!* The sound of the roar was so close every last control surface in the sphere rattled in its case. My eardrums rattled, too, but then I flared up the thrusters again, full blast and at an angle, and the *Tuscany* shuddered and flipped and shook and, with fortune, fell straight out of the maelstrom with inches to spare. I felt the edge of the Leviathan’s Maw graze the starboard side, and the impact again sent me into the roof while the ship rolled end over end over end again. I smacked my ribs up on a dip in the alcove and fell back down into the seat, head first, and then out onto the floor. 


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*


I managed to right myself with my good arm and get my bearings. I was free, but only just; the *Tuscany* banked and tumbled again and rolled, slower now in the absence of the whirlpool’s flood current, but not yet in control of its pull. I tried to steer away, but it was useless; the ship flipped around the back of the Leviathan’s titanic Maw and up over its head as the beast flew on by underneath me like a freight train. And for the first time since catching the monster’s eye I began to fully appreciate the magnitude of its size. 


It’s back was an endless, snake like and sharp-finned spine the size of a minor mountain range, and only quick maneuvering moved *Tuscany* away from the jagged back fins that chugged up towards me and sliced open the sea itself. They missed me by feet, and the blast of the current they’d swept up sent the submarine reeling backwards, off a bit further and into relative safety. 


*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!*


I quickly dimmed the lights to their lowest setting and caught my breath, as the full form of the Leviathan washed on past me. It stretched far away into the abyss below, for well over a mile, and dragging away behind it were thousands upon thousands of tentacles, a forest of the things, each the size of a six lane highway and tipped with razor sharp hooks and a flurry of wing-fins. It took a full three minutes for the beast to pass by me fully. And then it curved around in the other direction, and swam off in search of other things to devour. 


*Gggggggrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!*


The form soon slipped away into a shadow. And then it was gone. 


---


I surfaced hours later, having allowing the battered *Tuscany* to take its time with the journey. She was solely responsible for my escape - my quick thinking be damned. *A marvel of engineering indeed.* 


Once I did break the surface I disbursed a distress beacon and then promptly collapsed from exhaustion. Evidently, I was picked up by the Coast Guard some hours after that, a few hundred miles southwest of Hawaii, and pulled from the near-wreckage of my submarine and taken to a hospital on the mainland. It was there that I woke up a full day later. 


As I recovered I heard some isolated chatter of tremendous seismic activity near where I’d been, and how the whole ocean floor had changed and moved and shifted form. But I couldn't care less. I told the bastards what I knew. And on top of that, they have the *Tuscany* and they have all the recorded evidence, and you now have this written account. What everyone does with this information now, is entirely up to them. 


All I know is that I won't be doing any more diving any time soon. I’ve come to a realization: that mankind has more than enough space to expand throughout and live upon and thrive in above and near the surface, and on land, and in the skies and soon, hopefully, out there amongst the stars. 


But there are things in the sea that hold ownership of the deep. And perhaps it's best to leave it that way. [For all our sake.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheJesseClark/)

nosleep,I Met a Demon on the Tokyo Subway,"This story is a retelling of something that happened to me when I was seven years old. As the years have gone by and I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can’t shake the feeling that it is.

It happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only.

“This human is creeping me out,” he said. “It almost looks like it’s looking right at me.”

“I am looking right at you,” I said.

The demon nearly jumped out of his skin. “You can see me?” he asked.

“Yes. Can’t everybody?”

“Not unless they’re in the fifth dimension.”

“Am I in the fifth dimension?” I asked.

“Your mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?”

I thought for a moment, and then grinned.

“Trains.”

“Oh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you’re going crazy.”

“I hope I’m not going crazy,” I said.

“Being crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,” the demon replied.

I laughed.

“Do you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?” I asked.

“Of course,” he said. “How else would we get to work?”

”You’ve got wings!” I said.

“Yes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I’m all sweaty when I get there.”

“So what do you use your wings for?” I asked.

“I put them over my head when it rains.”

“Can I see?” I asked.

“Sure,” the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head.

I laughed again.

“You’re funny,” I said.

The demon laughed too, but then his expression changed.

“Are you okay?” I asked. “You seem sad.”

“Yes, yes.” the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. “Say, would you like to see a magic trick?”

“Okay.”

The demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out.

“That’s funny.” I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn’t holding my dad’s hand anymore.

I looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains.

“I can’t see the subway station anymore,” I said.

“That’s okay,” said the demon. “Sometimes it’s better to see what isn’t there instead of what is.”

“What do you mean?”

“Sometimes when I’m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.”

“That’s funny,” I laughed. “Can you go to other dimensions, too?”

But the demon didn’t answer, he was looking up at the sky.

“It’s starting to rain,” he said, whooshing his wings up over his head.

Warm droplets of rain hit my face. 

“Can I get under your wings with you?” I asked.

“Not now,” he replied. “You’ve got to go home.”

The world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face.

I opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn’t see my dad.

“Where’s dad?” I asked her. “Did he bring me home?”

“Yes, darling,” she said, although she didn’t look at me when she said it. “He brought you home and then he had to go away.”

“Oh,” I replied. “When will he be back?”

“I don’t know,” she said.

My dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train.

He said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater’s snout.

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3ijnt6/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/

Well, once again, you guys have blown me away with your staggering amount of responses to my stories! There's no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I'm just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I'm going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend's stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.

Alright, so the common questions I found you all had:

* I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality some of the things I've mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it's best if I just don't discuss too much. I will say that I'm in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We're talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.

* There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys my friend has a story that I think you'll all be very interested in. I'll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don't want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it's possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I'll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.

* As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer and training courses, or what the qualifications are. I've been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It's a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn't want to do anything else. 

Alright, let's move on to the stories:

* The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you're mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. 
This case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn't really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and shes got something in her arms. She's screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he's sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously we can't just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own. He's still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it's not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what's going on. She's rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she's holding, it's covering her with blood. That's when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what's going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she's holding. It's her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he's covered in scratches. Now, I've seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who's standing by. I tell him that it's a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he'll deal with it.
It took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can't have him, that he'll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He'd died instantly from the trauma to his head.
I was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he'd fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I've been on.

* I haven't seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren't that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you'll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They'll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who'd gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: 'God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.' I guess that's not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.

* I honestly don't know how I'd forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that's happened to me. I guess maybe I've tried so long to forget about it that it just didn't come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don't ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That's why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that's ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don't really like talking about it much, but I'll do the best I can to remember it all.
As I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call: a four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family's campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do; my kid would never wander away, she's so good about staying close, she's never done anything like this before. We assure the parents that we'll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you've done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job. 
We search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she'd be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we're not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we're trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we're all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going.
About an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one's found the little girl. Most of the time, we won't search when it gets dark, but because we don't have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy. We keep close together, and we're calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I'm hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it's a whole different beast. But we're not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point. 
We're about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I ask him if he's heard a response, but he just tells me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounds like a kid crying. We both call the girl's name and listen for any kind of response, but it's just this really faint crying.
We head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn't right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can't figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl's name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out. 
The crying is on a loop. It's the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It's exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It's the only time I've ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. 
When we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about. I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we've never found, but frankly I doubt we'll ever find anything. 

Of the missing persons calls I've gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and no body ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we've found that have become infamous in our team:

* A teenage boy who's remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.

* The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found. 

* The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park. 

* The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she'd vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. There were no suspects ever identified.

* The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.

* A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.

Now on to  a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you're in luck: he's had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn't have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do. 

* My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years, he started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out.
He said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn't feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn't feel anything. The only thing, he said, that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything. And there didn't appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn't feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed the stairs; he said it was terrifying, because the way they'd been stigmatized, he wasn't really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around. But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you'd get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head, at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn't mention what he'd done.  
But, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong.
'You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head.
'Because we didn't find her. The dogs lost her scent.'
My buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he'd been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he'd be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he's never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.

My buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there's never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn't found right away, they're either never found, or they're found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can't possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.

* The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn't done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter. 
He was out on a training op in the snow, on one of the higher peaks, when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern. About twenty yards away, he found the kid's body, laying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice, that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain. 
Now, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid's stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He's never really gotten over that one.

The last story I'll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. 

* They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It's unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he'd heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. 
He heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion's territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog. When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him.
It was almost night by this point, but he said in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed, and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, 'and impossibly long step' toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn't even say anything, he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn't mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved. 

I'm going to end this entry here, since it's turned into a huge wall of text. I'm going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I'll be gone until early next week. I'll be meeting with a  lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I'll be asking around about any stories they'd like to share. I'm so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I'm back from this op, I'll continue to share them!

nosleep,"When we turn 18, we get the name of our soulmate.","[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nmax25/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate/) || [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nqtu23/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate/) || [Final](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nvzhya/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate/)

I was young when I realized that the place I lived was special.

I didn’t realize it at first, since I had lived there my whole life. I thought it was normal for a city to not allow pets. I grew up never hearing the sounds of barking dogs, or hissing cats. No one that lived inside the city border was allowed to have them.

I thought it was normal for cities to have mandatory blood testing every week, with no explanation or seemingly any reason.

I thought it was normal for cities to not have any jails.

I thought it was normal for cities to give their citizens soulmates.

I never really understood how it worked. All that we were told was that there were the Matchmakers, who were responsible for making the matches, and sending out the tiny slips of paper that determined each citizen’s love life, and future. No one ever saw the Matchmakers. No one knew how they were recruited, no one knew how they worked. All anyone knew was that it worked.

Where I lived, there has never been a filing for divorce. The Matchmakers are never wrong.

Each citizen received their paper on their 18th birthday. Inside the piece of paper, there was nothing except a name. The name of your supposed soulmate. There was no telling how you would come across this person, no when or how. All anyone knew was that it would eventually happen. We were allowed to tell other people, allowed to ask around, try and seek out people that had the same name as the one on the paper, but it didn’t matter. It couldn’t be forced.

Of course, literal eternal love and happiness does not come without rules. Every citizen had to follow the Rules. They weren’t too strange, and seemed like a small price to pay for what you were getting in return. Most of the rules were simple. To name a few, there was no going outside, under any circumstances, after 2am. No pets, blood tests, etc. There were also rules that we weren’t allowed to know until we were older.

We got the new rules on our 18th birthday, the same day we got our Matchmaker paper. We called them Slips.

As I got older, I realized that our city was special, and that other cities didn’t have what we had, but I didn't care. Life was good, life seemed simple. Our city was like a little paradise. It was happy. It was without issue.

||

It was the night before my 18th birthday, and I couldn’t sleep. This was to be expected, since knowing that the next morning, you would know the name of your literal *soulmate* was enough to keep anyone up late.

Usually, I wouldn’t have believed in such things like soulmates, especially as I got older, but it was hard to argue with evidence. My parents had gotten married in their late 20s, and have stayed happily married ever since, both of their names matching what was on their Slips. My older sister Katlin got her Slip last year, and though she’s been through her fair share of failed relationships, she’s currently in a happy one with some guy named Roger. I don’t think I need to tell you the name that was on her Slip.

I wished Katlin still lived with us. We used to share a room, but ever since she moved out, it feels empty with just me in it. By some miracle, I eventually fell asleep, my brain finally exhausted after hours of wondering what tomorrow was going to bring.

I woke up the next morning, my arm groping for my alarm to turn it off, just like any other day. It wasn’t until I sleepily sat up that I realised that today wasn’t like any other day.

I swung my legs out of bed, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to compose myself. I wanted to pull on a shirt and shorts as fast as possible, rush to the kitchen to get the envelope I knew would be addressed to me, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to be one of those people who’s entire lives suddenly revolved around trying to find their soulmate. I needed to be calm.

Taking a few even breaths, I slowly put on a shirt and some basketball shorts, before opening my door. Chatter, and the smell of waffles hit my senses instantly as I stepped out of my room. Turning the corner, I stopped, grinning.

“Katlin!” I said, unable to contain my excitement at seeing her. Reaching her in a few short steps, I wrapped my arms around her in a hug, to which she enthusiastically returned. “What are you doing here?” I said, pulling myself away to look at her.

“Aw, you seriously thought I would miss your birthday? Get real.” She said, matching my grin as she looked at me. “*Damn* you got tall.” She said, looking at me. “He got it from his old man.” My dad chimed in, and Katlin rolled her eyes. Besides my height, I got a lot from my dad. I got his warm brown eyes, and I got his wavy, dirty blonde hair that I had always kept medium-length. I looked so much like my dad that my mom always chimed in saying how I got her nose and smile.

“Happy birthday hon.” My mom said from the counter, giving me a soft smile. “These are almost done, and we’ll go out for your birthday dinner later tonight.” She said, gesturing at the waffles, and I smiled. “Birthday waffles for the birthday boy.” My dad chimed in, putting an arm around my mom, and the simple movement made me remember something I forgot in the midst of the excitement. “Is it- is it here?” I asked them, trying to keep my voice even.

My sister nodded, understanding what I was talking about. “On the front table.” My legs felt like rubber as I walked the few steps into the hallway, instantly seeing the stark white envelope on the table. I picked it up.

*| Deliver to: Theodore Shillings |*

I walked back to the kitchen, all eyes on me as I turned the envelope over, trying to act calm, act normal.

I opened the envelope, pulling out two pieces of paper. One of them, I knew would be the new rules. The other one, was my Slip. I looked at the bigger paper first.

*To people(s) registered as 18 years as older, the following rules will come into effect.*

1. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted in city waters. This includes all local rivers within city limits.*
2. *Under no circumstances will anyone 18 years or older be allowed to watch the television on the 14th of every month.*
3. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use faucets after 12am. This includes sinks, bathtubs, and showers.*
4. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use any kind of elevator after 9pm.*
5. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to share their rules with people(s) under the age of 18.*

And that was it. I honestly expected more, but was relieved there wasn’t too many that I would have to memorize. They were weird, sure, but nothing that I wouldn’t be able to do. After re- reading the new Rules, I put the paper down, heart hammering as I took my slip. Wanting to get it over with, I opened it, to which a single name was printed.

*Avery*

I read, and re-read the name several times. Avery. Avery. *Avery.*

I racked my brain for people I knew named Avery. There was a girl in my history class, and maybe one who I had pre calc with a few years ago? Before I could wonder further, Katlin’s voice cut me off. “What’s the name?” She said, to which I handed it to her. It passed from her, to my mother, then my father. “Avery. Nice name.” My dad said, handing my Slip back to me. Chatter resumed between my parents and Katlin, while my mind was whirring.

Some things made more sense now, like why I never saw adults kayaking in the river like I saw them do in other cities. I had told myself for a long time that once I got my Slip, that I wouldn’t focus too much on it, but my mind kept coming back to the name that was burned into my mind. *Avery*.

I still had to go to school, and got ready while Katlin went out to reconnect with some high school friends. I ignored my texts asking what the name on my Slip was, preferring to have that conversation in person.

My friends were waiting for me at the bus stop eagerly. There was Jennifer, who was usually pretty quiet, and who I’d known since preschool. There was Joseph, who was a bit of a daredevil and a jock who I’d met during my freshman year. Lastly, there was Charles and Sophia, twins who were never separated, and who I’d bonded with sophomore year over our love for horror movies. Looking at us as a group looked weird, but we worked, and had fun with each other.

I was bombarded with the same question as I got close to them.

“Who’s name did you get?”

“Avery.” I said, the first time I had actually said the name. It sounded nice, coming out of my mouth, It sounded right. My friends nodded, followed by a moment of silence that meant that they were all trying to think of Avery’s that we knew.

“Isn’t there a chick in your history class named Avery?” Joseph offered, and I nodded. “Yeah. I’m trying not to think about it too much, I don’t wanna become one of those people who become obsessed with it.” I said, although the name was really all I could think about.

My friends dropped it after that, all except Joseph. He would chime in every few minutes, rattling off girls that he knew, all with the name Avery. He was still talking about it as the bus came, and as we walked up to the school. He really didn’t have an “off” button, which meant that I was left to try and tune him out, nodding my head in agreement every few minutes.

As the school day went on, I couldn’t help but wonder if each Avery I came across was my soulmate. Somehow though, none of the girls I came across felt right.

Everything else aside, the school day went pretty smoothly. People wished me happy birthday in the halls, occasionally asking who I got on my Slip.

After school, I still had time before I had to head home and start working on homework, so as usual, I met outside the school with my friends. The day had gotten progressively hotter as it went on, and by the time school was let out, it had reached the point of uncomfort. Most of my friends were already waiting for me, and as I got closer they were already in conversation.

“-balls hot man, we should go claim a spot by the river before it gets too crowded.” Joseph was saying, to which my other friends nodded in agreement. The river he was referring to was the biggest in the city, almost cutting it in half. It was a popular hangout spot, and my friends and I had been going there for ages. But now,  my throat felt tight. None of my friends had turned 18 yet, since I had an extra year of preschool when I was a kid. They didn’t know the new rules.

One of the rules said I wasn’t allowed to tell them. Did that mean I also couldn’t hint at it?

“Er, I’m not sure if I’m feeling the river today.” I said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.

“Are you crazy? It’s like, 90 degrees out here.” Jennifer said, raising her eyebrows. Not wanting to act suspicious, I decided that I would go, but I wouldn't go in. Under any circumstances.

“Alright let’s go, but I can’t stay long, I have my birthday dinner with Katlin and my parents.” I said, to which Joseph pumped his fist.

Relieved that none of them seemed to suspect anything, we set off towards the river.

There were a couple other families there, with kids playing in the shallow water and the parents sitting safely on the edge.

I took a few, even breaths to remind myself that I was fine, and that I would stay on the shore. Jennifer and Joseph were the first to the river, instantly pulling up their jeans and taking off their socks and shoes as they dipped them into the river, sighing with the relief that the cool water provided from the hot weather.

I desperately wanted to be there with them, swimming in the river and enjoying the nice weather, but the rules were very clear. I sighed, sitting down a few feet away from the water, my legs out in front of me, watching as my friends splashed each other with the water. I just had to hold out until they had their birthdays, and then I wouldn’t have to make excuses. I could handle a few more months. “Oi! Come on birthday boy, get in the water!” Charles yelled, splashing water in my direction as he was ankle deep in it, a few feet away from where it dropped off into deeper waters. I smiled, shaking my head as I adjusted my legs to make myself more comfortable. “Nah, I’ll be the one to drive you guys to the hospital when you get hypothermia.” I yelled back, to which I could see his eyes roll from here.

“Aw, we can’t have that!” Joseph called, wading back to where I was. “I command the birthday boy to get hypothermia with the rest of us!” Joseph said, smirking as he approached me. I felt a trickle of unease as he approached me. I stood up to move away, but just then he swooped down and picked me up over his shoulder. Joseph played for the football team, and I always admired his strength, but this was the first time I was afraid of it. “Joseph, stop! Put me down!” I yelled, panic rising in my voice, struggling to escape his arms as he was carrying me to the water.

My heart pounded wildly in my chest, as a rising fear crept up my throat. He outmatched me in size and strength, and my struggles were fruitless. “I’m serious Joseph, put me the fuck down!” I yelled, to which he gave a little laugh. “You’re always so serious Theo, loosen up! Live a little!” He replied, and I could see he was in the water now, wading further in. I looked at my friends, wide eyed, but they were giggling like it was a joke.

They had no idea.

As he got closer to the drop off, I struggled harder, hitting him on the shoulders. I wasn't weak by any standards, but Joseph was built like an ox, almost all muscle. Fear closed my throat so tightly, I couldn't breathe. “ Come on, everyone in the water!"" He said, motioning with his head to my friends, who obliged, standing on the edge of the drop. ""Alright on three, we’ll all jump in together.” He put his hands on my waist, and I knew what was coming. “One…. two…..” He started, rocking back and forth. “Joseph, stop! STOP!” I yelled, punching him harder, but it didn’t make any difference.

“Three!”

I heard the splashes of my friends jumping in, just as I was launched a few feet into the air.

I didn't know what to expect.

I shut my eyes tightly as images rapidly flashed through my mind. I saw myself at my ninth birthday party, saw myself applauding at Kaitlin's graduation. Rapid images throughout my life flashed before me.

Was my life flashing before my eyes?

It felt like an eternity before I hit the water.

Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next.

I hit the water hard, the cold water stinging every part of my body. The wind knocked out of me, but since nothing else happened immediately, I thought, fleetingly, that I was fine.

I was wrong.

It felt like a giant vacuum was at the bottom of the river, sucking me towards it. I thrashed in the water, desperately trying anything to prevent myself from getting sucked deeper. I had been swimming in the deep part of the river before, and one summer my friends and I actually measured how deep it was, and I knew well enough that I was being pulled far beyond that. I was running out of air, and my panicked state wasn't helping the situation.

Whatever was down there started to pull me faster, as if whatever it was could sense my desperation. My chest felt tight, as I could no longer hold my breath. My body started to go limp when suddenly- I was falling.

I was no longer in water, and I took a gasp of breath, sputtering out the water that had managed to get in my mouth from my surprise. I was so relieved to be breathing again, that it took me a minute to realize I was falling rapidly through the air. Darkness surrounded me, and through my confused, dazed state I couldn't make out what was around me. A few seconds later, for the second time during the day, my body hit water again, hard.

Once again, I had the wind knocked out of me, and I could feel myself sinking. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.

I didn't have the energy to panic. My eyes closed. I didn't know what I was supposed to think about. I didn't want my last thoughts before death to be wasted.

It was during these last thoughts that suddenly, something pulled me away from them.

Literally.

I could feel something grabbing the back of my shirt, pulling me upwards, towards the surface. Confusion swept me as a moment later, I felt myself being heaved out of the water, and being roughly set down, on something hard, something solid. I gasped, coughing and sputtering as water dripped off of me.

I shakily pushed myself onto my hands and knees, trying to get my breathing under control, my thoughts moving at the speed of light. I felt oddly light-headed, my body drained and exhausted. I wanted to look around for my savior, but I couldn't. My vision had started to go black, as my exhausted body finally collapsed.

||

Someone was shaking me awake. My first, fleeting thought that it was my mom, telling me I was going to be late for school. Then I remembered. It was just a dream. I told myself. Just a dream. You'll open your eyes and mom is going to wish you a happy birthday, tell you you're going to be late for school-

Someone shook me harder. I opened my eyes. It was not my mom.

It was a boy, who looked around my age with dark, messy hair and who was looking at me with two dark blue concerned eyes, who looked relieved as I opened my eyes. ""Good. You're awake. Come on, we need to move."" He said quickly, looking behind him. Confusion clouded my mind. ""Who- who are you? And where am I?"" I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. The boy looked back at me. ""My name is Avery. I can explain everything later, but we really have to go.""

My breath caught in my throat. Avery. Avery. Avery.

Oh, shit.",Entertainment
nosleep,"I just graduated from medical school, and my new hospital has some very strange rules","You probably think that all doctors are filthy rich, because I sure as hell did in the beginning. Eight years and a fistful of premature gray hairs later, I’m just a few hundred thousand dollars poorer than “broke.” That would matter if I had a family to provide for, but the long hours in med school have led to an end of my last relationship and a countdown on the shelf life of my ovaries. 

I was in a “take what I can get and be grateful” situation. 

So when St. Francis Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia offered me a position, I packed my sad life into three bags and sought opportunity in the hills of Appalachia. Nineteen of us started in July, and thirteen have since dropped out. 

I like to think of myself as the rat that wouldn’t drown.

Some people broke inside after watching children die because they weren’t good enough doctors quite yet (everyone has to be a rookie at some point). It’s doubly hard when you have to inform the dead child’s parents, who then beg you to tell them different news, or scream that they want to die and just please kill them with whatever drug takes away the pain.

But most of my incoming class couldn’t handle the chief of medicine. 

Dr. Vivian Scritt is, without a doubt, the biggest bitch I’ve ever met. 

Now I know why.

“Nineteen of you start today, and we’ve got a pool going with bets on how long each of you will last,” she told us on Day One. “Don’t feel any pressure, folks. I’ve talked with each of you in private, and my expectations are very low.” 

She peered condescendingly over her thin spectacles, snorted, then turned around to walk away. 

“You should know when to follow me and when to stay away, because I’m not going to waste time explaining what you should figure out on your own.”

We gawked at one another, all feeling weak and small, then scampered after her. 

I was last in line, and felt out of place taking even that much.   
 
“You should have the list of expectations for St. Francis,” Dr. Scritt explained as she walked on, not bothering to look at us as she talked. “I printed eighteen sets of rules so that you would have to challenge one another for them, knowing that one of you would be left behind.”

An icy cold settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw everyone look down at a list of rules that only I did not have. 

“If you cannot follow these rules, there will be no place for you in this hospital. It most likely means that you are unsuited to be a doctor, and should consider a profession that demands a weaker mental aptitude.” At that, she turned around to face us all. “And if you think that I’m the type to give second chances after a mistake, you’re woefully underprepared for the world of medicine.” She stopped and looked at each of us in turn, apparently expecting a response that no one dared to offer.

“Well,” she shot out in exasperation, “why are you standing here? People are dying. Get to work!”

*

No one wanted to show me their list of rules, so I had to wait until one of my classmates died.

It took nearly a week. 

I was working at 3:00 a. m. because I had only been on the clock for ten hours. I was rushing into another room so that a patient wouldn’t know I was Googling his symptoms (doctors do this FAR more than you realize) when I saw Myron by himself in an O. R. 

I stopped immediately. “Myron?” I squeaked. “What the hell is that?” 

His arms were working furiously, but his back was turned toward me, so I couldn’t see what he was doing.

Something felt wrong. 

Myron was the pick of our litter. He’d been top ten in his class at John Hopkins, and he would remind us of that fact in exchange for answering the questions that we were too terrified to ask Dr. Scritt.

Slowly, I approached Myron, not wanted to startle him. “We’re really busy right now, is there something you need help with?”

He showed no outward signs that he had heard me. Instead, he kept pumping away furiously at the task at hand. 

When I was five steps from him, I could see drops of blood flying over his shoulder. 

Which made no sense, since he had been alone in the room.

“Myron?” I whispered, barely loudly enough to hear my own words.

I slowly crept around his left side, finally bringing the scene into full view.

Myron’s abdomen was split from sternum to pelvis. His esophagus spilled out, and his stomach sat on the table. A nest of quivering small intestine led from the bottom of his stomach back into his shredded torso. 

Myron showed no outward signs of pain.

He was too busy working.

He clutched his own stomach tightly in his left hand, the folds squirting through his fingers like unbaked bread. His right hand was working furiously with a scalpel, sawing his organ into ribbons. Rivers of sweat poured down his forehead with the intensity of the effort.

I tried to scream, but it only came out as a moan.

That was enough to get Myron to notice me.

Slowly, he raised his head. Slowly, he smiled.

It was not a happy smile.

With eye contact locked on me, he licked his lips, angrily stabbed a piece of his stomach, and lifted it to his mouth.

He bit.

He chewed.

Then he lunged.

But most people don’t know how to move with their innards splayed out for all the world to see, and this was his downfall. Myron’s tattered guts caught on the corner of the table, and he fell to the floor. 

Finally, he screamed. 

I had learned very early in my medical career that compartmentalization is indispensible. That instinct took over my brain in the moment, and I acted clinically.

Myron was still grasping his scalpel with his right hand. I kicked it – hard – and it flew out of his hands.

He stared at me and screeched.

With his entrails still wrapped around the table, I figured my best option was retreat. I moved to the back of the room as a doctor and a janitor burst in. 

And in possibly the most shocking moment of the night, I realized that they were *not* shocked. 

Myron was anesthetized, subdued, and extracted within a minute of their arrival. 

For a moment, I was alone with a pool of blood and diced stomach lining. 

And something else.

A sheet of paper lay on the floor, its corner just touching the edge of the creeping blood. 

Myron had dropped his list of rules. 

The practical part of my brain continued to drive me. I snatched the paper from the ground, then quickly exited the room, taking care to avoid the puddle.

I didn’t want to leave any bloody footprints in my wake. 

I knew that I had to read the list as soon as I was able to find thirty uninterrupted seconds to myself. Three hours later, I had my opportunity and ducked into a janitor’s closet. With a shaking, *exhausted* hand, I pulled the chain on a bare bulb, tried to ignore the noxious smell of leaking ammonia, and read.

-------------

**St. Francis Hospital Rules – Guidelines for new doctors**

1 – Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else.

2 – If any other doctor displays erratic behavior, leave the area immediately. Do not make eye contact.

3 – If any other doctor is approached or detained by someone in a janitor’s uniform, do not interfere. Never ask about that former doctor again. 

4 – Never touch any seemingly abandoned Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Those are Dr. Scritt’s favorite candy.

5 – Any child that dies in St. Francis hospital MUST be cremated within 120 minutes of official time of death. If you suspect this rule has been broken, alert Dr. Scritt, and the hospital will be evacuated. 

6 – There is no Children’s Burn Unit at St. Francis hospital. If you find yourself there, continue walking until you return to familiar territory. This usually requires traveling in a straight line down the central hallway for 47 minutes. You will not reach a wall during that interval.

7 – This rule is on a need-to-know basis.

8 – A small quantity of sulfuric acid is kept in every room. This is ONLY intended for use on patients with severed spinal cords. If they attack, a hypodermic injection of H2SO4 into the cranium is the only way to subdue the subject. 

9 – The morgue must house at least 13 cadavers at all times.

10 – If find yourself on the hospital roof with no memory of how you got there, you have only two choices. Either wait for an extraction team to find you, or jump four stories to the sidewalk on Court Street.

11 – If you see Room 1913, do not look directly at the numbers. Do not open the door. This is, by far, the most important rule.

---------------

My heart stopped when the door opened.

Dr. Scritt was staring at me. What little emotion shined through her exterior seemed to be surprise.

We both stood, frozen, for five seconds of agonized silence. 

“Dr. Afelis,” she drawled gravely, “I’m shocked.” She stared down at the bloodstained list of rules in my hand.

I reached for words. *Any* words, because literally any response would make me look less guilty than I did in that moment, staring up at my boss’s boss’s boss and saying literally nothing in my defense as she weighed my soul with her eyes.

And I said nothing. 

“You took a list that wasn’t yours, and were nowhere to be found after your coworker experienced such an *unnatural* incident.” Dr. Scritt huffed through her nose. “It seems that *you’re* willing to do the unthinkable in the name of getting what you need. And *Myron* couldn’t’ even follow the most important rule.” She clenched her teeth. “I had a four-year streak of predicting which incoming doctors will break the soonest. This will *ruin* my chances in the office pool.”

The ghost of a smile graced her lips before she turned to leave. 

“Get to work, doctor. You’ve got three hours left on your shift, and those symptoms aren’t going to Google themselves.”

I didn’t realize that I’d been holding my breath until I heard my own gasp for air.

Shaking, I slowly emerged from the janitor’s closet. I quickly stuffed the list of rules back into my pocket, reflecting on the fact that I had just achieved what *might* be considered an actual win.

Perhaps, just maybe, I would keep my head above water at St. Francis after all. 

I turned to head down the hall when I stopped in my tracks. 

Everything was unfamiliar. What the hell had happened?

I glanced all around. The design of the hallway was familiar, but everything was *off.* I could hear people talking in the rooms, but the immediate vicinity was devoid of all people but myself.

Nothing made sense.

Then I looked up.

And I’ll be honest, I peed just a little when I read the sign.

nosleep,The terrifying note addressed to my six-year-old son,"My wife and I are beside ourselves right now. This is the type of thing you see in the movies, but now it’s happening to us.

Yesterday evening, a little after six, my wife and I were in the kitchen cooking dinner when my six-year-old (almost 7) son Kyle walked in from the back patio. He was holding a folded piece of paper in his hand and had a strange look on his face. My son is constantly drawing (and loves to read and write) so this usually wouldn’t have stood out to me at all, but he’d just come in from hitting the baseball off the tee and really had no reason to be holding a piece of paper. 

My son is the type of kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve. When I asked to see the piece of paper, I could tell he didn’t really want to give it to me because he flashed his typical *I’m gonna be in trouble if I do* face. I insisted, and he finally handed it over. Here’s what it said:

>Dear Kyle,

>I know this note may sound scary,

>(your daddy will think it is),

>but grownups don’t know 

>how friendships can grow

>when kids are just left to be kids.

>And what a kid you’ve become, Kyle!

>You’re growing as fast as a weed.

>Last night off the tee

>you stroked it for three

>and your team took a two-run lead!

>Yes, I’ve been watching (a while now, its true).

>I think we would make perfect friends.

>You’re a kid through and through,

>And I am one too,

>even if just for pretends.

>The problem, I fear, is your parents.

>(I doubt they would let us hang out).

>One is just rude,

>the other a prude,

>church-going, pure, holy, devout.

>I’ve got an idea

>(can you tell my hand’s shaking?)

>for me and you getting together!

>Tomorrow at three,

>you can come and see me

>at the address attached to this letter.

>But please (pretty please!)

>don’t tell your dad!

>Your mom and he won’t understand.

>Just come by yourself,

>I’ll be dressed as an elf!

>And we can even hold hands!

>Would you like that?

>(You will! You really will Kyle!)

>We will have (my oh my) so much fun!

>So I’ll see you at three,

>by the sycamore tree,

>where our two kindred souls become one!

There was an address scribbled at the bottom of the page.

>3 Orange Circle.

I knew immediately it wasn’t a prank. 

Carrie, my wife, is the youth group leader at our church. And Kyle did just have a tee ball game last night. Orange Circle is only one street over from our street, and I'm pretty sure lot 3 is the corner lot on the culdesac, which has an empty house with a large sycamore tree in the backyard. 

Was this sicko really watching Kyle’s game? What would have happened I hadn’t seen him with the letter?

I shouted for my wife to come read it. When she did, she flipped out, and ran for the phone to call the police. 

I flipped the note over, and on the back was some more text. I couldn’t read it at first, but quickly realized it was written backwards, I’m guessing so Kyle couldn’t have read it. To read it, I had to hold it up in front of a mirror:

>And now (just in case)

>if your Dad’s reading this,

>it’s time to tell him a story.

>If your mom flaps her hole

>Or your dad tells a soul,

>I’m afraid things might get rather gory. 

>On the 10th of July, 

>1995,

>A woman named Susie went missing,

>Susie, you see,

>(unlike you and me)

>wasn’t careful about who she’d been kissing.

>I kept her a while (but old things get so boring!)

>and in time I had gotten my fill.

>I threw her away

>and to my great dismay

>the hunger I felt plagued me still.

>I tried to bury it deep down inside

>(where nothing down there can escape).

>But lately it seems

>I see Kyle in my dreams

>And that hunger can no longer hide.

>Now that you know what I’m capable of

>(more than both of you can comprehend),

> if one word is spoken,

>then children get broken,

>and Susie will have a new friend.

The police arrived in a half hour and we showed them the note. They told us to stay inside and lock the doors for the remainder of the night. The man had obviously been in our (fenced-in) back yard, which made me sick to my stomach and had me cursing myself for not installing the security camera I’d gotten for Christmas. 

Nothing happened last night, thank God.

This morning, I got a call from the detective assigned to our case. He’d reviewed the list of missing persons cases from 1995 and something had turned up. 

Suzanne Kerrington went missing July 10th, 1995, just as the note said. The last person to see her alive was a friend who saw her at the 24-hour gym they attended together. Susie had said she’d met someone new and wanted to get a quick workout in before getting ready for their second date. Susie was never seen again and the man was never identified. 

And, maybe the worst part, was Suzanne's address. 

3 Orange Circle. 

I'm supposed to meet with the detective later this evening. 

What should we do?

UPDATE: The detective just called back. They're sending an unmarked patrol car with two plainclothes officers to 3 Orange Circle at 3 p.m. today. Kyle's teachers have been notified and he's safe at school and won't be going to recess today. I'll update tomorrow with any news.

nosleep,I’ve been squatting in a condemned high rise. These are the rules I follow to stay safe.,"I’m not homeless.

I have a home. I just don’t own it. But it’s mine and I work to keep it. Every city has its fair share of abandoned buildings to squat in, but usually you gotta deal with either cops or shitty neighbours. The Annedale High Rise has neither. Police stay away, so do the locals. As a stranger from out of town I stumbled across the place on my first night in the city and thought it a little strange that a 28 story tower block had been left to rot. Every window black. Every light in the courtyard smashed. No cars in the lot. No booth for a guard. Not even barbed wire on the fence. Barely half-a-mile from a playground filled with shouting drunken teenagers but none of them strayed in the direction of Annedale. No fires or music or bottles hurtling through the air. It was silent.

Inside, I found that the lobby had been torn to shit. Double doors ripped open and left that way for what looked like years. Easy access for the curious, but I was the only one there. Most of the first story had collapsed. Waterlogged ceiling tiles turned to mulch by shitty British weather. I know water is invasive, but it had practically fucking colonised the place so bad algae was growing up the walls. Even the elevator shaft was flooded. My own reflection looking back at me as I peered through brackish water and caught a glimpse of the old rusted carriage just a few feet below. I couldn’t help but think about standing on top of it, waist high, and reaching down to pull open the emergency hatch. Only natural to wonder what was down there. Little metal box soaking in pitch black water for years and years. I thought about pressing the button, calling it up and seeing the elevator rise in spite of all logic. An image I still think of from time to time.

Meanwhile the empty shaft loomed above, cables whistling in the wind. I’ve learned not to linger by it. If you look up you’ll sometimes see something ducking out of the way, pulling its head through the doors before you get a good look. It finds it awfully funny, even tries to make a game out of it, like peekaboo. Play too much though and it starts to pop up elsewhere. Any open door becomes an invitation. Sent more than a few people running for their lives in the middle of the night, but bad news for them. That thing is more than free to leave this place if it’s part of a game.

If you ask about Annedale most people just shrug or laugh. Kids’ll talk about it same way they talk about any haunted house. Difference is no one dares anyone to go up there. No one uses it to get pissed or high. No one sneaks into the basement to have a risky little fuck. No one hides their stashes there. It has all the hallmarks of your classic urban legend, only people *actually* stay away. They’ll laugh and joke and tell scary stories, but they treat the soil its on like it houses a radioactive leak. And the council, I’m surprised they haven’t knocked it down but they, out of everyone in the city, have the most to lose by talking about it.

They built it in the mid fifties as government housing. Only a lot of the young mothers who moved in there found their children’s health taking a turn for the worse. Started with newborns. Babies that wouldn’t wake after a peaceful night’s sleep. The kinda deaths that got written off as either negligence or abuse, screaming teenage girls hauled off to prison on the words of doctors who didn’t give a shit. It’s always the mother’s fault in some people’s eyes, and these girls had no one to stand up for them. Two in the first year, four in the next, and they kept on coming for every year until it closed.

Wasn’t until 1982 that someone traced the source of deaths to tainted water storage on the roof. Toxic metals leeching into the supply. Not enough to kill an adult, but bad news for anyone with weak immune systems. Thirty eight women had been imprisoned by then. Another twenty three had killed themselves before they could be sentenced. And those are just the ones accounted for. Not all the deaths were from the water. Annedale has a way of being bad for any child’s health, no matter the circumstance.

More than a few toddlers starved to death as their parents rotted in the tub from an overdose. Even more were lost when they found their parent’s stash, little bodies wracked with agonising fits as their panicked mothers screamed for help. One tripped down the elevator shaft because the doors opened as if the carriage was right there. And those are the ones who were found. Plenty more went missing, written off as runaways. In the end Annedale’s reputation as a cursed place got so bad the only way out was to shut the whole thing down. Board it up. Erase it from the records. Pretend it never happened and just forget.

But Annedale kept on killing even after the doors were officially shut. If anything it only got nastier. Talked to one cop who told me he found a guy dead from sepsis on the sixth floor couple years after the place was shut down. No one could fucking believe it. They reckon this guy scratched himself on a nail and caught gangrene like it was the 1800s. Never went to the hospital. Just laid there and died slowly and painfully as the infection spread, but not before he took every last bit of furniture in the room and shoved it against the door. Strange enough on its own, but it was the flag he’d made out of his own clothes that freaked everyone out. He’d scrawled *HELP* on it, like he wanted to get someone’s attention down below even though the lock was on his side. He could’ve left anytime he wanted.

Cop I spoke to said he was there when they kicked the door down. Still remembers the look in dead man’s eyes. He was glaring at the door two days after he’d passed, white knuckled fists gripping a blanket that smelled sickly sweet from all that infection.

There were others too. Lots of people falling, many of them without a good reason. Got so bad they bricked the roof door but by the time I arrived someone had cleared it all away with a sledge hammer. I still don’t hang out up there. Not after I first went up and saw pale fingers gripping the ledge, like someone was hanging off it and holding on for dear life. I reckon a lotta people see something like that and think a person needs their help. They go rushing over to offer a hand. But when I saw it something about those grimy nails set alarm bells off in my head. Fingers looked all wrong. So I took my coat off and used a broom handle to move it closer to the ledge. Sure enough those ugly hands snatched at the coat and ripped it outta my hands, sending it hurtling to the parking lot below. I’ve thought about taking a closer look from time to time, but I got a thing about heights and could never bring myself to investigate it much further.

You’d think I’d leave, but it’s my home. I own it as much as it owns me. People even refer to me as the caretaker now like they forgot I wasn’t always here. Police treat me the same, can you believe that? Any reports of a break in and they call me on my number to go take a look, like I’m some sort of official. Only other guy who was here as long as me was the philosopher. I don’t know his name, just call him that because of the books he left behind. He came here back when the block was still just a place to live and he stuck around for a few years after its closure. Lots of notebooks in his flat. Thousands of pages talking about child sacrifice made to gods who don’t like being named, along with pictures of strange things frozen in ice and medical photos that look fake.

At first I thought he came to document the curse. He has dozens of books just recording all the strange things he saw, like birds with too many wings or milk that turned to clotted blood in the bottle. But after going through every thing he owned I found letters to a wife who’d died in childbirth. He kept her death certificate way at the back of an old looking box filled with the letters he’d kept writing her long after the date.

Another box, just a row over, had the letters she’d written back. Awful things scrawled on random scraps, shit and blood for ink. He dated them himself and sometimes wrote notes about how they came to him.

*Delivered by a rat that was cannibalised in front of me.*

*Pulled by my dentist from a cavity in my mouth.*

*Written in the web of a spider with thirteen legs.*

Anyway, he gives away the real reason he moved to Annedale in one of the letters. Says that Annedale was the key to helping her, that he was weeks away from figuring out how to open the door. Told his wife he’d bring her back. Told her he knew how. I’ve never figured out where he went next or what happened to him, but his apartment was locked when I found it and likely would’ve stayed that way if the key hadn’t turned up in my inside pocket on the first morning. Now I live in his old place. It’s safe in there. He’s written things on the wall that keep everything well behaved. Symbols that I don’t understand but which are easy to trace so that’s what I do. I go over them every couple of months and so far they’ve kept me safe and sane.

Because you do need protection in Annedale. I don’t know when in its history the curse went from something mundane to something very real and very dark. It wasn’t all just bad luck or poverty, not by the end and certainly not anymore. You can’t just go strolling around Annedale, certainly not at night. It’s dangerous. For one thing, it attracts a constant rotation of the deeply unwell who are likely to attack on sight, if you’re luckly. They usually turn up dead in the halls come morning, although sometimes it’s just bits of them that I come across. Strips of skin floating on the brackish water that floods the basement stairwell, or bloodied fingernails embedded in the ceiling plaster. Weirdest one was a single tooth in a lightbulb, bloody gum still attached to the root, the glass all around it somehow intact.

Many of them come here with business, something a little like the philosopher’s. Rituals. Bargains. Things like that. It’s not a good idea to interrupt them, or to give them even the slightest hint you might be a problem. Every night I lock my door and wait for Annedale’s business to finish and come morning I do a sweep, floor by floor, and clean up whatever’s left of the tower block’s strange pilgrims.

Most of the rituals don’t look real to me. In fact, I reckon a lotta people who come here just end up as victims of something or someone else. There are a *lot* of reasons to stay out of Annedale at night, and most of its visitors strike me as a little naïve. Most of what I see looks like it got stolen from a bad death metal album. I once found a book called “Satanism and Witchcraft in the 21st Century”. It’s hard to imagine that the secret inner workings of the universe can be found in something with an ISBN number and 3000 Amazon reviews. Of course, not all attempts at exploiting Annedale’s energy are so hackneyed. I had one guy turn up at my door and pay me three grand in cash just to show him the darkest corner in the building. I wasn’t sure what he meant at first. Thought he meant light and shadow.

“Sort of,” he replied when I explained this to him. “Darkness like that can be part of it. But I’m looking for a corner, has to be a right angle or more acute. Ideally, more acute. You understand that term right?”

He’d seemed arrogant and that last sentence confirmed as much. Good looking guy in his late twenties, nice suit. Looked like the stereotypical banker. Acted like one too.

“Plenty of places like that,” I said. “Lots of funny rooms in Annedale. People trying to make the most of limited space. Sometimes the walls meet at tight angles, sure. But I don’t know what you mean about dark. There’s the basement. It’s flooded. Can’t think of anywhere darker than that.”

He bit his lip and hesitated for a second or two, as if he was actually contemplating it.

“Not a bad suggestion actually, but no, too difficult to reach. And I don’t just mean dark as in the absence of light. I mean dark like under the bed. Dark like that one chip in a wall that leads to a hollow space between the bricks and as a child you can’t help but wonder what lives there. Somewhere that just inexplicably feels… like it’s not got as much of God’s attention on it as everywhere else.”

I thought about this for a second. His words were vague but damn if I didn’t know what he meant.

“A corner?” I asked. “Has to be an acute corner?”

He nodded.

“I think I know the place,” I said and he smiled like real creep.

I took him to a flat on the eighth floor. It was rundown like everywhere else but there was still enough of its old furniture lying around. You can pull open random drawers in there and still see the cutlery people once used. There’s even an old analogue TV on an old stand. You can perch on what’s left of the sofa and stare at that TV and get the feeling you knew the people who lived there once. Run your thumb over the dials on the toaster, the handle of the fridge, or the yellowing plastic of a light switch, and feel an aching loss that creeps up on you out of nowhere.

Look up and you’ll see that the light fixture has been torn out of the ceiling, like someone had tried swinging from it.

Not a big place, by the way. Three rooms. A bedroom with a double bed all rumpled up. A living room slash kitchen. And a tiny little spare room that looked like it once would have been used for storage, or a washing machine maybe, *if* you were single and childless. A slither of space, a triangle carved out of whatever room was left over when other more important walls had been put up. That sofa I mentioned, the TV, they were all placed so whoever was sat down could always keep an eye on that room and its contents.

You see they’d put a cot inside and it’s still there, bluebottle flies circling overhead. You can’t see inside the cot, not unless you went in and actually pulled the blankets out but it’s been decades and no one has managed it yet. It’s dark behind those old blankets, a heavy shadow that dissuades a closer look, like there’s something in there no one needs to see and it’s spent a long time sat there eating what little light there was. Even with a window in that room, daylight doesn’t really filter down.

“Perfect,” the businessman said when he saw it. He gazed around the flat one detail at a time, his head pausing for a moment and a smile creeping across his face as he laid his eyes on the broken light fixture. And the cot, the sight of it, the flies that still circled above faded Winnie the Pooh blankets, it made the breath catch in his throat.

“Oh this is… *yes* this is good,” he told me. “Dark like under the bed. You’ve earned that money. I could have had a dozen men sweep this place and they wouldn’t have understood the brief as well as you have.”

“Thank you,” I replied even if that wasn’t really how I felt.

Quietly the man sat down and began to unpack his leather satchel. No pentagrams to be found, although he did unpack seven strange looking candles. He caught me looking at them and smiled.

“Home made,” he said. “Each one shaped by my hands. I’m not a good artist, but it’s the effort that counts. Took forever to rend the wax. Of course that was the easy part. The hard part was getting the fat to make it. Did you know there can be a surprisingly high level of security around a hospital’s medical waste department?”

“I didn’t,” I replied as he took out some flimsy bits of wood and a few small nails. He oh so carefully began to nail the splinters of wood together into what looked like random shapes.

“Oh well,” he sighed after a few quiet moments, his fingers nimbly gripping the tiny hammer as he tapped away. Already he’d put together at least six of the strange little wooden polygons, and with each new one I felt a strange sensation. “Would you like to stay and watch?” he asked.

“Absolutely not,” I answered.

He stopped tapping and smiled once more.

“Oh you’re clever,” he said. “That’s the correct answer, by the way. And if I’m to respect it, I should inform you that now is the safest time to leave.”

I made my way to the exit just as he lit the first candles, but not before I looked towards the cot one last time. I was surprised to see a hollow blackness that extended beyond the doorway, like a curtain had been draped across it, only there was depth to it that drew the eye. The businessman paid it no attention, but after a few more seconds he eventually looked up at me expectantly.

“Can I ask what is it you want?” I said. “Everyone who comes here, I don’t get the sense it ever works out for them.”

“I’m looking for a new kind of afterlife,” he replied.

“Do you need one?”

“We all need one,” he said with a wry chuckle. “But only those of us willing to take a few risks will get a better deal. Everyone else…” He grimaced. “It’s worth the bother. But look who I’m speaking to.”

He looked to the darkness that enveloped the doorway. Shapes could be seen floating past.

“You should leave now,” he said.

I pulled the door shut and, noticing that the sun was rapidly setting, ran to my apartment where I knew the walls would keep me safe.

When I returned the next day the man’s satchel was still where I’d last seen it, propped against one arm of the sofa. The candles had burned down to the very end of the wicks and left a lingering smell that’s still there all these years later. And of the man himself, well in the room with the cot—which still has bluebottle flies orbiting overhead—there is now a shadow burned into the wall. It’s blurry and diffused, but vaguely recognisable as a man on his knees, his head pressed to the floor in a gesture of supplication.

I’ve known it to occasionally move, to turn its head and look towards me at which my point my temples throb, my ears pop, and a darkness begins to encroach upon the edges of my vision. I never exactly considered that flat to be Disneyland before, but now I avoid it like the plague.

Still, it could be worse. Not every ritual ends so cleanly and at times I’ve had to personally intervene, something I hate bitterly. If people want to go poking around in the universe’s undercarriage that’s their business. It’s one thing if I’ve got to sweep what’s left of them up afterwards but at least that’s a one and done job. Sometimes it isn’t so clean. One guy turned up and told me he’d be a new “resident”, my neighbour, and we’d get to know each other. A bumbling old man with an upper class accent and the look of a professor who was down on his luck. He set up in the room next to mine and no matter how little I spoke to him, he never really got the hint and kept trying to act like a good friend. Few times I did initiate conversation it was to tell him the place he’d chosen didn’t have much in the way of protection. He pointed to some funny little rashes and told me *they* were his protection.

Over the next few weeks I’d bump into him from time to time, always on his hands and knees, scraping some dank corner or mouldy pile of bumpy growths. He collected fungi, told me on the first day, and I’d often see him wiping his samples onto petri dishes that he whispered quiet words to whenever he thought I wasn’t around. I don’t think he was sane, but he probably wasn’t completely barmy because he lived long enough to get a sense of Annedale and only come out in the day. Meanwhile his apartment filled up with a growing collection of chittering terrariums and pickle jars, their specimens hidden by murky fluids. All over, he planted and cultivated strange mushrooms and moulds. Encouraged them to soak up the darkness of Annedale and set them to grow in the rife conditions he’d cultivated.

Towards the end his living room had mushrooms growing out the walls. Plaster crumbling beneath microbial armies until there was only concrete and rebar, and even then mould continued to grow and thrive. A few times I peered in and found him feeding meat to the frilly growths that exploded out of the old furniture. During this time the symbols on our shared wall would often grow hot, and I found myself having to replace them on a nearly daily basis as he tinkered away on the other side. I asked him once or twice to tone it down.

“This is important work,” he growled, an unseen darkness creeping into his voice. “I’m not some ditzy crackhead trying to summon the Baphomet! I’m not looking to get *high*. This is science. Progress! That is what I am working towards.”

“Yeah well your progress is trying to eat its way into my flat. Can you ask it to stop?”

He stopped, froze in mid gesture like I’d said something either profoundly stupid or insightful, or likely a bit of both. He looked at the rashes on his arms that had, by now, started to sprout some of their own strange fruit. When he finally spoke again it was sly, like a lecherous old man propositioning a nurse.

“This fungi,” he said. “They had samples of it in the university for thirty years! Can you imagine? They never even realised what they had until I found it and unlocked its potential. Now I’ve finally found the source and I can do things no one else thought possible. This entire time my thesis has depended upon the idea that the fungus has… a capacity for information processing way beyond anything we’ve considered before. And your idea is a good one, you know? Asking it just might be an option…”

He scuttled off without another word and for the next few days he set about the building like a furious little honey bee in Spring. Poking and prodding, setting trap after trap and cleaning them vigorously of any rats or mice he caught. When I did my morning sweeps I’d find him hovering over Annedale’s latest victims, scraping what was left of them into transparent bags for his own purposes.

“Don’t mind me,” he’d mutter. “It’s worthless to you, but these poor souls could help me achieve great things.”

This persisted for another month. He no longer scraped mould or mushrooms off old apartments. He became interested only in meat, and by the time it came to an end I can say confidently that I have never smelled anything worse than the prickly musty odour that wafter out from under his locked door. It became so bad that I began to wonder if I might have to ask for police help and have him removed when, finally, he simply disappeared from Annedale’s halls. One morning he was there, annoyingly shooing me out of the way as he lowered jars into the flooded basement, and then the next he was gone and Annedale’s halls were silent once more.

But that didn’t mean he had moved out. Far from it, actually.

It took two days before I decided to just go ahead and break his door down. I kicked at it with a short sharp blow only to find my leg immediately disappeared through wood that had the texture of sodden cardboard. I freed my foot and tried a different tactic, grabbing the handle and pulling so hard that it simply *popped* right out of the rancid wooden frame. Free to move, the door swung open with an eerie creak and fetid air, hot and damp, blew out of the room.

Inside I found that the man’s specimens had gone wild. Terrariums had shattered, their contents spilling outwards. Frogs as large as footballs glared at me from behind furry fronds, and insects with human eyes scuttled away before the amphibians could snatch them up. In one corner rats had built a hive out of old cardboard, their backs covered with fungal growths that resembled human fingers and other appendages. In another corner something that looked a little like a black rubber sheet slapped furiously at passing vermin and it took me a few seconds to realise it was a slime mould. When it finally caught something it dragged the strange creature squealing into the dark corner where it grew and constricted around its meal like a fist. I stared at it horrified until one by one black orbs unveiled itself from within the strange mass and I realised it had eyes to stare right back at me.

It was a cacophony of God awful terror, so gripping that it kept me from hearing the muffled noise of a human struggling to speak. Eventually it did reach my ears and I used my torch to light up the far wall without having to actually step inside.

I found the scientist half-grown into the wall. Algae and moss coated him head-to-toe so that he was no longer recognisable, but I had to assume it could be no one else. Wide eyes glared at me with terror and pain as nasty little critters nibbled away at what was left of his shins, meanwhile strange tendrils probed at his ears and head, never resting for a moment. He kept trying to speak, but the algal growths kept driving their way into his mouth until, one-by-one, they pushed too far and something snapped. His eyes went wider still, his squeals became hysterical, and his jaw slowly slid further down his chest until it hit the floor with a sodden thump.

“Finally made contact?” I asked. “An awful idea if I’ve heard one. What would a mushroom have to say even in the best of circumstances? Let alone one that was grown in the ruins of Annedale? I can only assume you never got around to telling it to stay off my wall, did you? No you probably had your own reason or doing all of this and that’s what took priority.”

That made me wonder what it was he’d asked for. As the thought entered my head I took a quick look around and tried to see if anything particular stood out to me. Something was growing on the sofa that looked strangely human-shaped. It might have been just my imagination, but in the dark it seemed to turn towards me. Meanwhile the scientist continued to shiver in agony, his eyes focused on me and begging for help.

“I’ll see what I can do,” I said before slamming the door. Something about that strange pile on the sofa had deeply unsettled me.

I put the word out, asked for a gun, but got a crossbow instead a few days later. A nervous looking sixteen year old boy ferried it to my door. I was surprised he’d entered the building, but who knows who’d ordered him to do so. I’ve acquired a strange sort of respect amongst the locals and it comes in handy. This boy looked like he would have stamped on my head and robbed me blind any other day, but when he spoke to me he did so with more respect than I ever imagined I deserved. I thanked him, took the crossbow, spent an afternoon practicing with it, and then used it to kill the scientist the next morning.

Took a few hits, but in the end one thumped into his forehead and shut down his whimpered moans. I didn’t see anything on the sofa this time, at least not anything human-shaped, which I was thankful for. After that it was a simple case of calling the police and beginning a long chain of events that ended with half-a-dozen men in hazmat suits spraying the room with noxious chemicals. For a while there I’d been worried that they’d find a corpse and ask questions, but by the time anyone actually entered the room there was nothing left of the scientist save a splotch on the floor.

I never did figure out exactly what it was he was after, although it is not uncommon for my morning sweep to turn up a body (or part of) covered in fungal growths. And I have been known to occasionally catch glimpses of a strange person lowering themselves into the floodwater of the elevator shaft. Of course I might just be making connections that aren’t really there. All sorts of things live in that water. The entire level is flooded and if something was down there, it’d have free reign over quite a large space.

It's a strange world down there. I should know on account of one visitor who gave me a very bad time. I’ll call him the fisherman since he came to Annedale because of the flooded basement. Saw a photo that’s been circulating around for a while now, if you know where to look. God knows who took it and how, but it shows the flooded stairwell leading to the basement and beneath the brackish surface is a hand that’s all out of proportion. Fingers splayed with perfect symmetry like a starfish, it is reaching up out of the depths and resting gently on the third step below the water.

When I first met him he was sitting happily with his feet over the edge of the flooded shaft, water up to his knees, with a rod and line set up beside him. It was quite a surprise at first, seeing him there with a little fly-fishing hat. A chubby but healthy looking man in his forties with an egg mayo sandwich in one hand and a phone playing candy crush in the other. I called out to him as I approached because, in my experience, startling someone in Annedale is bad for your health no matter how sane the visitor appears.

He looked up when I caught his attention and smiled amiably.

“Hello,” he waved with his sandwich. “You’re the caretaker?”

“Yes I am,” I answered. “And you are?”

“Just a tourist,” he smiled. “Care to join me?”

The sun had risen only moments ago.

“You weren’t here when it was dark, were you?” I asked more than a little suspicious.

“Oh no you’ve only just caught me, been here barely ten minutes before you showed up. I was told you’d be willing to help in exchange for a small fee.”

“What sort of help?” I asked.

“Oh just give me a nudge if any of the lines start moving,” he said while pointing to a rod he’d set up beside the basement stairs. The door was propped open and the line led down into the darkness below, water gently lapping just out of sight. Another line had been set up in a corner of the lobby where the floor had been torn away revealing a hole straight down into the basement. “I can’t keep an eye on them all at once, you see. I have bells ready but, well, two heads are better than one.”

“What is it exactly you’re hoping to catch down there?” I asked.

“Are you familiar with the primordial ocean?” he said. “The abyssal waters that God split into light and dark, all that? It’s not a physical location, per se, but it does connect to certain bodies of water depending on the time and place. Last recorded manifestation was in a glass of old whiskey underneath a forgotten bar in Mexico City. Some poor fellow knocked it over and didn’t notice until the following day when half the bar was suddenly underwater. Quickly rectified but some of the things swimming in that water were something else, and all from at the bottom of a glass no wider than my wrist. Imagine what we can do with this!?” he said while gesturing at water by his feet.

“You think there could be fish alive down there?” I asked.

“At least,” he replied. “I’d be willing to pay for any reliable information, of course. Do you have any idea what might be down there?”

“Not really,” I shrugged. “But I’d guess it wants to be left alone.”

“Hmmm you might be right there,” he said while looking at his other rods. “I didn’t exactly put down any old lure, you know?”

He reached into his pocket and took out a strange tuft of fur and ivory, holding it up for me to squint at.

“A tooth from a man who drowned in the sea. A drone collected it off a shipwreck near the Norwegian coast. The fur is actually red algae that was found growing on his bones. I have plenty of these and, well, other things that might appeal to what’s on the other side. My research was thorough and expensive. Come on, take a seat. Flat fee, one thousand, just sit here until the sun starts to set.”

“I just have to sit?” I asked.

“And let me know if you hear or see anything.”

I groaned and sat beside him, folding my legs instead of letting them dangle in the water below. Despite my reticence, we stayed like that for several hours. He’d brought lots of food, good homemade stuff, along with plenty of cold beer. We sat there and spoke very little, but we did eat and drink a tremendous amount. Not the kind of thing I do normally, but I was being paid to be there, and I didn’t really have anywhere else to be. It was, all in told, a very pleasant afternoon.

Until I fell asleep.

When I awoke it was with a terrible gasp. My chest was tight like something had been sitting on it, and judging from the terrible giggling and scampering feet I heard running off into the darkness, it might not have been *just* a feeling. Already panic was setting in as my eyes darted to the open doors and saw that the moon was out and had been for hours. I fumbled for my torch and turning it on saw that there was no sign of the fisherman. All his stuff had been left behind yet all that remained of him was his hat that still floated on the water. Even as I watched, a smooth glistening shape curled beneath the water and plucked it off the surface.

I recoiled and crawled away from it as fast as I could. This was bad, I knew deep in my heart I’d never been as at risk I was in that moment. The open doors that led outside were tempting, but just beside them were the stairs that led downwards and I swore I could hear something approaching. I couldn’t help but picture the fungal man I’d seen in the scientist’s flat. Then again, that basement was huge and who knows what lay down there.

I decided to go for the stairs. The entire time my heart was in my chest. I had never been caught outside my room at night, not since my first night when I’d slept in the lobby with my coat pulled over me. You don’t get lucky twice, not with Annedale, so I knew had to be careful. I had to be quiet. My only hope was to go unnoticed. I took to stealth, climbing each floor in perfect silence, hiding in well known spots at the slightest hint of footsteps, human or otherwise.

Annedale comes alive at night. Whispered mutterings from strange children who descend from air vents, living there for God knows how long. Other times I saw apparitions including one, a toddler, the sight of whom made my stomach growl with an insatiable hunger that hurt just to contemplate. She stared at me with pleading eyes as I slunk away from her open door. I might have been tempted to help her were it not for the sight of the moon peering through her translucent image.

And yet, despite all this, I somehow made it to the fourteenth floor alive. Only it was there right at the final hurdle, so close to safety, that I came across something out of my worst nightmare.

A woman stood outside my apartment door. Silent. Pale. Dirt covered fingernails. It was all too often I’d open my door and find muddy impressions on the floor made by a woman’s bare feet. Now I knew who left them every night. I couldn’t see her face from where I hid, but something about her seemed profoundly familiar.

When she finally turned towards me I remembered. I recognised her, even though most of her face was missing. It was the philosopher’s wife. He had succeeded, it seemed. But I couldn’t imagine at what God awful price, because the woman who stared at me had clearly weathered some years in the grave. It was only the poor lighting and her long hair that had covered up just how bad a state she was in. A lipless grin stared back at me below sunken cheekbones and hollow eye sockets. And yet, I could tell that in another life she had been beautiful which only made the sight all the more gut-wrenching.

“My darling,” she whispered, and there was something about her voice that I found hard to stay sane in the face of. I don’t know why. Over a decade in that place and I’d borne witness to living nightmares, but it was *this* walking corpse that pushed me to my limits. The inescapable feeling of loss weighed me down and without realising it I found myself taking steps towards her even as my knees buckled. By the time I reached her I was crawling until I could clutch her grimy icy leg, and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up in my bed the following morning.

Everything seemed normal, so completely mundane that I could’ve written the whole thing off as a bad nightmare. But there were footprints leading from my bed to the door. And later on I found the fisherman’s things much as he left them, although when I finally reeled his lines in I found the lures gone and replaced with bits and pieces of the man who’d first set them up. I threw it all into the water below and decided it would be best to forget him.

Every now and again, of course, I can’t help but check my peephole at night. I never did before that, but now I do. I see her every single time. She looks sad. Hurts me to think of her out there. It ought to be terrifying but it’s more like someone’s ripped out my stomach and heart and let all my insides fall out the bottom.

Each time I see her I wonder what exactly was it he did to bring her back?

He leaves only one hint. A final letter, I think. It’s not like he dated them. In it he says he would give everything to have her in his arms once more. Not only his life, but everything he’s already lived. Every sunset. Every good dream. Every nightmare. Every victory. Every loss. Every little memory that makes him who he is, he’d give it all just to save her.

Sometimes I wonder about him, figuring we’d probably be about the same age. I’d like to think back and imagine what it would have been like for the two of us to meet as young men, but for some reason whenever I try to remember what my life was like before I came to this city, before I woke up with that coat pulled over me… well, I don’t know…

It’s just hard, that’s all.

It's almost like there's nothing there. Like something reached in and took all the years away. I guess it's just one of those things I'm better off not dwelling on.",Entertainment
nosleep,I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying [Part 3],"[Read Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dlk100/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the/?st=k269q0gn&sh=f6440917)

[Read Part 2 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dm86h5/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the/?st=k269q1qh&sh=b655a8d9)

After another dozen hours or so, I opened the bathroom door. The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn’t smell any sulfur. 

I cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I’d ever eaten. 

When I’d finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?

I crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They’d almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.

She had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. 

“Mary!” I hissed.

She pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. “Yeah? What’s going on?”

“Are you ok?” I asked. “What did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?”

“I’m sorry, remind me how I know you?”

“What do you mean? We just-” I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. “Mary, how long have you been on this flight?”

She checked the watch on her wrist. “Well it’s 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.” She stared at me the same way you’d look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. “Hey, don’t worry so much. Look on the bright side; we’ll be landing in about an hour.”

I felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. “Sir, this area is for first-class passengers only.” 

They were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. 

I was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. 

In retrospect, those few days weren’t so bad. There’s a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn’t get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.

It was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn’t come for several minutes, but eventually one did.

“Just...just let me see the Captain,” I asked.

The flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: “I’m sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn’t answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.”

“How long?”

“Quite a while I’m afraid. Don’t worry though sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.” She straightened and walked away.

I started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched a given movie, that sort of thing. 

It was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.

I’d guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. 

Two months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. 

I got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn’t work, I’d find some other more painful way to go. 

I grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it’d been for the past who-knew how long. 

The open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant’s hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. 

The wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn’t want to die after all. 

It grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.

I impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I’d hit it on the seat in front of me.

“No,” I whispered. Then shouted. “NO! NO! NO!”

A flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. “Are you OK sir?”

I clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. 

She wasn’t grinning.

She wasn’t crying. 

To be honest she looked a little scared of me.

I reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. 

4:04 AM.

“Sir, if you can calm down we’ll be landing in about an hour.”

My mouth tasted like ash. “Thank you,” I managed. “I will.”

I stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.

Then I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. 

We did land in about an hour. I can’t even begin to explain why or how, but I’m currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I’m free. I’m out.

And I’m never going flying again.

EDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.

nosleep,I can see people's auras... and it's a curse.,"Yes, I can see people’s auras. 

And I hate saying it so bluntly.  It makes me sound like some hack psychic who fakes the ability as a means of exploitation and a paycheck.  I’ve never made money from my ability. I’ve never taken advantage of it.  And, until now, I’ve never spoken of it to anybody.

But I really do see them, and I’m starting to view it as more of a curse.  I have a reason for typing this out and I assure you, there isn’t a happy ending.   

For me, it’s quite simple.  I see a faint light surrounding people.  Everyone.  And in that light, I can see their *morality*.  The brighter and more translucent the light is, the better the person.  The darker and opaquer, the worse.  Dim and partly translucent are morally ambiguous.   To simplify things, those are the three ways I describe them.  Dark equals evil.   Bright equals good.  Dim equals somewhere in between.  It’s strange, I’ve always viewed the people with grey/dim auras as… arbiters.  Mediators.  The people in between, who aren’t one or the other, and will always have difficult decisions to make.

I was a child when I first became aware of my gift.  It didn’t take long to figure out that the brighter auras were kinder to me and selfless.  While both of my parents are good people, my father’s aura was quite a bit brighter than my mothers.  As a result, he was always far more patient and understanding with me.   It was clear to see that my teachers and fellow students with brighter auras were usually friendlier and more compassionate.  The dark auras were the stereotypical fighters, lunch money stealers, and bullies.  I would say I was around 8 years old when I fully figured out that I have a gift that most people don’t have.  That possibly *nobody* else has.

I’ve read some of the ‘new age’ websites and alternative medicine articles that give their take on aura reading.  While I believe that the vast majority of it is bullshit, I expect there must be at least SOME other people out there with my ability.  So I don’t want to completely dismiss those people as an outright hoax.  It’s just that, for me, it doesn’t work anything like the way those websites describe.  I’ve visited numerous aura readers and psychics.  Most of them have dim or dark auras themselves, and I’m certain they don’t really hold this power.  I’m not saying all “psychics” are terrible people.  I’ve visited a few who had very bright auras.  They were unable to convince me that they really have psychic powers, but they at the very least used their deception to try and help people.  

You need to understand… I’m going to end this entry by sharing a terrifying event that is happening to me.  But before I get to that, I think there are a few more things I need to explain.  I imagine many of you are curious as to what type of aura is the most common.  I’m happy to tell you that the majority of people are somewhere between dim and bright.  I see very few dark auras.  This isn’t scientific, and I haven’t traveled the world plotting out charts and graphs, but I’d estimate around 60% of people are bright-ish.  Around 25% dim-ish.  Leaving just around 15% dark-ish.  Again, these are just estimates.  What’s the precise difference between, say, bright and dim?  I have no idea.  But rest assured, there is far more “bright” in the world than “dark”.

The next thing I’d like to discuss is children.  I can see a person’s aura right from birth, and I’ve never encountered an aura changing as someone ages.  I’m not sure what this means for the whole nature vs nurture debate.  And I’m not saying that everyone with a dark aura always behaves terribly, or vice versa.  A person with a bright aura might be born in horrible conditions, acquire a drug problem, and then resort to thievery to feed their addiction.  I think the difference is this… a bright aura thief with a horrible upbringing may rob someone, but they would never intentionally hurt someone in the process.  A dark aura thief would kill someone if they could get away with it without even a second thought.  

Another interesting note…  I find the ratio between bright/dim/dark to be similar across pretty much all human activities.  Whether I’m at a church or a death metal concert, it always seems to be around that same 60%-25%-15% ratio.  I once visited a federal prison and was shocked to see that at least half of the prisoners had bright auras.  I had to be at the prison in person to see this because I can’t see auras on photographs, television shows, movies, or even in mirrors.  I can only see auras in the real world.  Another strange thing… I can’t even see my own aura.   I assume and hope I would be on the brighter spectrum… but I can’t see it.

The brightest person I ever saw worked as a social worker.  She shone so bright that it was difficult for me to even look at her.  Based on the way people acted in her presence, I think that almost everyone around her could sense her brightness in a subconscious way.  Everyone loved her. She had donated a kidney to someone she barely even knew.  She had a special needs adopted child.  Most of the money she earned was donated to various charities.  And that’s only the little that I knew of her.  This woman shined so brightly that she scared me.  It was scary that someone could be so good.

But it wasn’t nearly as scary as the darkest person I ever saw.  I was 20 years old at the time, leaving a club downtown at 2 am.  A man quietly walked down the street.  I didn’t see him at first, but I noticed the light dimming around me.  This man was so dark that he partly absorbed the light around him.  I looked at him long and hard.  He looked desperate, cruel, and callous.  When he looked up and locked eyes with me, it made me fall back.  He smirked, as though he knew what I could see.  I saw his face up close.  I would never forget it.  And I recognized it when I saw his mugshot a few weeks later in the newspaper.  He had murdered his ex-wife and two children in cold blood.  

I think I need to get to it now.  The reason why I’m writing this out.  

I fell in love a year ago.  She didn’t shine anywhere near as bright as what I’ve seen before, but she most assuredly wasn’t dark or even dim.  She was beautiful.  Her sense of humor, her wit, her.. everything.  She was my dream woman.  And I’ve never told her anything at all about the auras I see.  I could go into far more about her but this isn’t a love story.  What’s important is this:  We fell in love.  She got pregnant.  We got married.  We were happy.  We were *so* happy.

I remember hearing the buzz of my phone two mornings ago.  I remember my excitement when I saw “It’s happening.  Come to the hospital.”  I remember my frustration when I got stuck in traffic.  I remember how long it took to find a parking spot.  I remember shouting at a nurse “WHAT ROOM IS MY WIFE IN.”  I remember bursting through a door and seeing the smile on my wife’s face.  I remember seeing the doctor, his light shining so bright, as he told me “Congratulations, it’s a boy.”

The doctor held him up to me.  

And all the light in the room dissipated.  

“No, this can’t be.”  I remember saying.    The doctor put him in my arms.  

The darkness around my son was so absolute that I could barely even see him.  He was a void.  He was so dark that the world barely even existed around him.  It was like nothing I’d ever experienced.  I started weeping.  I think my wife and the doctor thought they were tears of joy.  But they weren’t.  Lord knows they weren’t.

I think back to the dark outline around that man that murdered his family.  It was up to that point the darkest I’d ever seen.  But the darkness around my son was 100 times worse.  A *thousand* times worse.  And what could possibly be a thousand times worse than murdering your entire family?

It’s been two days.  We’re home now.  My son’s darkness is so extreme that it dims the hallway leading to his room.  My wife knows something is wrong.  I think she suspects I’m having regrets about having children at all.  If only she knew…

What do I do?  He’s my son.  Just 20 minutes ago I stood above him, holding a pillow over his face.  But I couldn’t do it.  Not yet anyway.  A man who could murder his two-day old baby boy: what color would his aura be? 

And here’s the thought that keeps going through my mind as I sit here alone.  The fathers of our worst.  The Adolf Hitler’s.  Joseph Stalin’s.  Timothy McVeigh’s. If their fathers knew what they would become, would they murder them in the cradle?  Would they have the strength to hold down the pillow as long as it takes?

I can see the door of my son’s room from my office.  The hallway seems to be growing darker.  I look down at my hands as I type this.  Maybe I’m going crazy, but there seems to be an aura around my hands and arms now.  It’s gray.  It’s dim.  Maybe it’s always been dim.  

I’m looking down at the pillow beside me.    The grayish dim outline around my hands more apparent than ever. Maybe it’s time.  Maybe this is why I have this gift.  It all comes down to right now.  

Maybe it’s time.

I think it’s time.

nosleep,Under The Back Porch,"As a kid I lived with neglectful parents at best. At worst dad would turn his screams and fists on me but I learned quickly how to dodge the worst of it. Mom wasn’t much help, she’d just smoke in the kitchen and bitch at him for staying out so late.

At the time we lived basically in the middle of nowhere, our nearest neighbors were a long walk away for a six year old and we had trees between us. No one to run to for help. But I was pretty small for a kid my age. I learned I could fit pretty much anywhere. The closet. Dryer. I think even once I tucked myself under my futon in such a way I could still get some air but no one could see me.

I was a master at hiding. But it wasn’t for a good reason.

One night though, one night I chose to do something different.

I could hear it in dad’s yells, he was pissed and was about to get violent. Mom wasn’t helping either, just piling fuel onto an inferno of a flame. So I knew I had to find a good hiding spot. I’d gotten the idea a few days before, when I realized the lattice covering the bottom half of the back porch had a hole in it. Not big enough to fit a full grown man, most likely, but it could fit a skinny six year old no problem.

So wrapping myself up in my blanket and grabbing my hippo stuffie, I snuck out my window and ran into the backyard. In the middle of autumn. When it was forty degrees out and the temperature was steadily dropping.

I crawled under the porch, scraping my elbows and getting splinters in my palms but I fit inside. It was actually quite spacious compared to most my hiding spots, I couldn’t sit up all the way but I had plenty of room to spread out my limbs.

Of course I was also getting covered in dirt. It’d rained a few days ago so the mud was still a little wet. I wrapped myself in my blankie the best I could and settled in for the night.

But soon, even with my blankie and my hippo, my teeth were chattering so hard I could barely breathe. I didn’t want to go back inside though, knowing if my dad caught me I’d be in for the whipping of my life. So I had to tough it out.

“Honey, are you cold?”

That voice was not the voice of my mother, scratchy from all the smoking and screeching she did. It was sweet, like honey. I turned over to see the dim outline of a woman, lying on her stomach next to me. She had a pretty butterfly necklace and was just as dirty as I was.

I nodded, not wondering how she’d been down there without me noticing.

The woman belly crawled forward and wrapped her arms around me and suddenly I became warm. Like I was sitting next to a campfire. I snuggled into her arms, not minding the mud, after all we were both dirty.

“You’ve gotten so big,” the woman said, examining my face. “How old are you now, Alex?”

“Six.” How did I know this woman again? I didn’t think I did.

“Six!” The woman gasped. “You’re all grown up then. I’m so happy.” She sighed pleasantly and stroked my hair. I’d never felt so cozy in my life.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

She smiled, I could hear it in her voice. “I’m Lily. What’s your favorite thing to do?”

I had to think for a second. “I like board games. And coloring.”

Lily chuckled. “Just like me then. Could never get enough of Scrabble. But I guess you’re still too young to play that, huh?”

I nodded. “Lotsa words. I wanna play it though. I like the tiles. Would you play with me?”

I heard Lily sharply inhale. “I… I don’t think I can. Your daddy put me under here, and I can’t leave… but…” She thought for a second. “Alex, could you do me a favor?”

“Of course!” This lady was oh so nice. Why wouldn’t I do her a favor?

“When you wake up in the morning, go to the police station. Ask for an officer by the name of Lowell Joyce. Tell him where to find Lily, okay? Under your back porch. He’ll come and he’ll get me, okay? And… and then maybe we can play Scrabble.”

Yippee! I was too excited about the possibility of playing Scrabble to notice how Lily’s voice caught at the end. I nodded vigorously. “I’ll do it! We can be on the same team, right?”

Lily softly laughed.

“I’ll help you understand the rules. Goodnight, Alex.”

When I woke up the next morning, I heard Lily’s voice.

“Go now. Your dad’s gone to work. I’ll tell you how to get to the station.”

Rubbing my eyes, I crawled out from under the porch and went into the house to grab my shoes and a coat. I shivered in the frosty cold. But I thought Lily was right behind me.

After my shoes and coat were on I started walking. It was long enough to get to the neighbor’s house. I really can’t remember how long it took to get to the police station, although I have no idea why no one pulled over to see what the hell a six year old in dirty pajamas was doing walking alongside the road. Lily kept guiding me onward.

“Wait. Okay, cross the street now.”

“Turn right here.”

“Keep going! You’ve almost made it!”

I nearly collapsed with exhaustion by the time I walked into the station. The guys out front chatting and having a good time didn’t see me until I almost made it to the front desk.

“Whoa! Kid! You okay?” One of the officers knelt down to my level, eyes wide.

I nodded. “I’m okay. Can I speak to Lowell Joyce?” I asked.

One of the other officers picked me up. “Sure kid, sure, let’s just get you someplace warm, holy shit your lips are blue…”

I remembered quietly scolding the man about watching his language. ‘Shit’ was a bad word.

I was given some warm cocoa and wrapped up in a blanket by the time an old man with a graying mustache sat by me.

“Hey kid. I’m Sheriff Joyce. What’s your name?” He asked.

“Alex.” I set down my cup and looked him straight in the eye. “I was told to tell you that Lily is under the back porch.  You need to go let her out so we can play Scrabble.”

I had never seen a grown man turn pale before.

Lots of things blurred together at this point. I remember being taken back to my house and there were a lot of police cars and people around. The back porch was surrounded by yellow tape, and someone was taking a black bag away while my dad was in handcuffs.

After that, I lived with my grandparents. Sheriff Joyce and his wife.

I tried to ask about what happened and who was Lily but I always got shut down. I was too young to know.

But life got better. A lot better.

Grandpa was the best man I could’ve hoped for in my life. We went out on weekends to the movies where he let me have the giant soda even though I’d have to pee in the middle of the movie. When I asked if I could drink when I was thirteen he let me try a beer. I spat it out and didn’t touch it again. He never judged me for my love of art, letting me paint my own bedroom multiple times over the years. I felt safe around him. He never laid a hand on me. My grandmother was amazing too, over the week she’d homeschool me along with teaching me things that you wouldn’t learn in a school, such as how to respect others but not take their crap. And cooking. Lots of cooking. I could make my own birthday cake by the time I was twelve. But I usually just made them for my friends. I got a lot of those, after I was free from my dad.

When I turned sixteen, Grandpa took me back to my dad’s house.

The whole thing had been bulldozed over. But I could still see the yellow tape wound around a few trees, faded and torn.

We sat together on the back of his truck. He opened a beer and drank half of it before setting it down and grabbing me an orange soda.

After I’d drank it he told me.

“Lily was your mother.”

Good thing he didn’t tell me as I was swallowing, I likely would’ve had it coming out of my nose. “My mom?” I questioned, confused.

“Your actual mom. The woman who lived with your dad was not your mother.” My granddad grabbed another beer. “Lily was my daughter. I loved her so much… but when you were around six months old, she vanished.”

My stomach dropped. “My dad just imprisoned her under the porch?” I asked, starting to feel sick.

Grandpa took a deep breath before setting his unopened beer down. “That’s…. something I’ve never been able to understand. Lily told you to find me? And that she loved Scrabble?”

“Yeah. She kept me warm that night. I probably would’ve frozen to death if she hadn’t been there.” I was a stupid kid, even I knew that.

Grandpa went dead quiet before he opened that beer and slammed the whole thing. “… Alex, Lily had been dead the whole time she was gone. When we dug her up she was bones. Experts confirmed it, and your dad confessed to what happened. They’d gotten into a fight and he threw her down the stairs. She… broke her neck.” He clenched his fists. “I knew he had something to do with her disappearance, but I never had proof until you walk into my station, covered in dirt and telling me she was under the porch.”

I was floored. I couldn’t breathe. All I could do was shake my head.

“But- I saw her! She was alive! She had this butterfly necklace…” I trailed off when Grandpa pulled an evidence baggie from his pocket.

There was that butterfly necklace all right. Rusty, and parts of the paint had chipped off, but I remembered it as clearly as I remembered Lily’s voice.

Grandpa took a shaky breath as he pressed the bag into my hands. “… Lily loved you so much. ‘ts why she stuck around that bastard. You were her whole world. She was constantly taking pictures and sendin’ them to us in the mail. Sometimes a mother’s love can accomplish things that no human can do.”

My eyes overflowed with tears as I clutched the necklace to my chest. Choking on sobs, I leaned against Grandpa. He held me tight and I swear I felt a few of his tears land on the top of my head.

And for just a brief moment, I swear I felt that warm love I felt that night under the porch.",Entertainment
nosleep,The homeless in my neighborhood don't just want change," Two whole years ago my wife Angie and I decided it was finally time to buy a house. We knew it was anything but a buyer’s market, but we were sick of paying triple what a mortgage would be in rent every month.

I’m sure this story is familiar to some of you and we went through every stage of disbelief, anger and finally apathy after every competitive offer we put together was blown out of the water by a multinational investment corporation. 

I’m not mad about the process anymore although it left me questioning where society was headed. 

HOW IS THIS LEGAL!! I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PAID OFF DEBT. I GOT A GOOD JOB. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO STILL GET PRICED OUT THE FUCKING CITY I GREW UP IN!!! 

Perhaps some anger remains. But after setting our sights on the city’s less desirable neighborhoods we finally got our home. 

On June 1st we moved into a 4,500 square foot colonial. 

It had hardwood floors that patinated like leather and the frosted plaster trim gave the ceilings the look of a wedding cake. The basement was a different story. It wasn’t just unfinished; it was a dank hole in the ground and scribbled on the walls were strange spirals and crude faces.

“Kids.” The realtor had said like she knew who drew the markings. “Fixing up the basement would be quite the value builder!” 

So, sure, the kitchen had composite counters and the basement needed a sign above the entrance that read, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here” but we had a home. And a damn big one at that.

The catch was that it was a stone’s throw from the freeway and that the area was known for its crime more than anything else. Angie said it was just a steppingstone, we’d bank a year’s worth of mortgage, hope the housing market keeps rocketing and move again in a year. 

There were some flaws in her plan, mainly money, but I didn’t say anything. I figured we’d both adjust to like it there. 

The first few weeks went smooth and me and the wife got to unpacking and introducing ourselves to the neighbors. Maybe it was the threat of crime and that there was comfort and purpose in knowing who you lived next to, but whatever it was our neighbors were incredibly friendly. 

We felt at home quick and while there were some shocks, we made games out of them to take the fear away. 

With the pops that permeated the night we had the game where we guessed whether the sound was fireworks or gunshots. When we passed large turds one of us would point and we played 

human or dog. 

Unfortunately, after just a couple weeks at this game we became experts at differentiating between these. Gunshots carry the sharp crack of the sound barrier being broken while fireworks go boom or pop. As for the poop let’s just say that we hadn’t seen any dogs large enough to lay landmines around town.

There was a homeless problem there for sure, but they minded their own business. Our neighbors seemed to see right through them. They’d act as if they were ghosts. Like they weren’t even there. Hell, everyone did. 

I’d smile and say hello in passing. The least I could do was treat them like human beings.

One night after a movie I was at the sink washing the popcorn bowl. The window above looks out to our backyard which was heavily wooded for a city lot. When it was dark out, I could only see a sliver of what was outside beyond the reflection of myself in the glass. 

I frowned at the shadow of a tall dark stump. I don’t remember a tree there. I swayed on my feet to see past my reflection. 

In between the bushes, nearly out of sight, a man was standing still, staring back at me. My heart leaped and I dropped the bowl where it crashed in the sink. 

“You okay in there, honey?” Angie shouted from the living room. 

“Yeah.” I kept my eyes on the man and said nothing to Angie not wanting to alarm her. “I’m gonna take the trash out.”

“Ok.” 

I walked by the trash without touching it and opened the back door. 

“Hello?” Outside the wind was blowing hard and the branches of the buckthorn the man stood behind were waving wildly as if to warn me.  

“What do you want?” I stepped forward to try and show I wasn’t scared but it was the tepid step of prey like I was better planting my weight to run.

The man said nothing.

I took another step forward more confidently this time but jumped when my movement activated the motion light. 

I composed myself and yelled. “This is private property! If you don’t leave I’m calling the police!” 

Now this was the emptiest of threats and everybody in the neighborhood knew it. The cops made a point to show up an hour late if at all. 

The man walked forward a few paces to where I could see him better. He was very tall and wore a heavy wool overcoat that stretched all the way to his ankles.  

He kept walking towards me, my brain was shouting but I froze in fear.

“What do you want?”

He stopped just in front of me. A white scar starred across his black skin just below the chin. He was at least six-foot-six but the coat that ran the entire length of his body made him gigantic. His face was recently shaven and gaunt.

He held out his fist at arm’s length and when he uncurled his fingers, cupped in his enormous palm was a pill.

“I don’t have any drugs.” I said.

His face didn’t change any. There was no want or question in his eyes. 

“You want me to take it?” I pointed at his hand but still his expression was static.

I reached out and gently plucked the pill from his palm. I held it between my forefinger and thumb. It was just a pill capsule, whatever had been inside had been emptied.

“What do you want?” I asked again.

He opened his mouth revealing the severed stump of a tongue and then he widened the enormous whites of his eyes. He began to mouth something but being tongueless I couldn’t tell what. But my blood cooled because I felt certain it was some kind of curse.

“Please,” I murmured. “Please leave.”

He turned and stepped into the night and I watched the bushes sway in his wake as if he were a giant parting his way through the woods. 

\_\_\_

The next day was Saturday and I was determined to find out if anyone knew about this tall man. I walked to the strip mall and asked some of the homeless in the area, but as soon as I began to describe him, they all looked at the ground and shook their heads. 

The pattern was repeated with every other homeless person I tried to talk to. On my way home, I stopped by two men working on a car at the end of a driveway.

“Hey,” I started over to them. “This may sound a little crazy, but do you know of a tall fella around here that wears a giant coat?” They both started laughing. “Sorry to waste your time.” I turned to go.

“No, no.” One of them was waving me back. “You talking about a really big motherfucker?” The man raised his hand to signify. “Yay high? Black coat? Nasty scars?”

“Yeah.” I nodded.

“Well, that’s Tall Frank. What you wanna about him? You see him in your recycling?”

“No, why?”

“Tall Frank’s a can man. He makes his living that way.”

I nodded. “He was acting weird in my backyard last night.”

“Weird how? Was he just looking like his weird self ?”

“No. He was staring at me from outside. When I went out he tried to say something. Or mouth something.”

Both of their brows rose. “You saying that Tall Frank tried to communicate with you?”

“Yeah.” 

They both looked at each other. “Tall Frank talks to nobody. And by talks I mean… communicating in any kinda way.”

“He cut his own throat to never talk again.” The other chimed in. 

“That’s just a rumor. Tall Frank showed up in this neighborhood twenty years ago. No one knows where he came from and the man can’t tell ya. Yeah, people put all kinds of legend to those scars. Some say it was dog that bit him. But I never seen no dog that’ll slice your tongue out.”

“If he doesn’t communicate with anyone how come he has the name Tall Frank?”

“Hmm. Well that’s what my mama would call him.” He leaned closer to me. “She used to tell me to watch my tongue or Tall Frank’ll take it!” He chuckled to himself.

“What do you think he wanted with me?”

They both shrugged. “No clue. But you be sure to tell us when you find out.” 

They bent back to their work and I thanked them and went on far less assured than when I’d first set out.

\_\_\_\_

The next several days there was no sign of Tall Frank, but I began to fall ill. It was a headache at first, but soon I had heart palpitations and body aches that I almost let take me to the emergency room. 

I assured myself that there was no such thing as curses. Why was I letting one strange encounter with a homeless man dominate my every thought? Angie was working late recently and when I had the house to myself at night, I would stand at the kitchen window and stare into the backyard. 

I was obsessed and it wasn’t long before I saw him again. I was wrapped in a blanket filling the teapot at the sink when I saw him standing in the same place as before.

I dropped the pot and ran to the back door. 

“Hey!” My head felt light and I was in that same kind of drunken state where your fear hardly speaks to you. I scampered through the backyard over to him. “What do you want with me?”

Tall Frank was staring at me. He gestured with his scarred neck for me to follow. 

I looked down at my bare feet, but he was already walking. 

“Hey! Just leave us alone!” 

I stepped cautiously after him. When I got past the bushes where I could see the alley I saw him standing near the trashcans.

I ran after him. “You! I don’t ever want to see you back here again!” With our difference in size and the blanket wrapped around my shoulders I’m sure I looked to him like some angry hobbit. 

He certainly didn’t act intimated and I can’t blame him. Tall Frank crossed the alley and sat on a crumbling retaining wall. He gently tapped the stone next to him for me to sit. 

“I’m not fucking sitting.”

He reached into his breast pocket and paused before pulling out an envelope. Then he put the letter in his other hand and reached in again and pulled out another. 

“What are those?”

He extended the envelopes to me, his long arm nearly stretched the entire alley. I approached the letters cautiously snatching them and stepping back. 

“What are these?” I muttered already distracted. They had both been opened and I took the papers out of one of the envelopes.

It was a handwritten letter on college ruled paper. All the ink was smeared like it’d been dunked in water, but I could still read it albeit slowly. When I was done reading, I let my arm fall down to my side and stared at Tall Frank in disbelief. 

Angie had a lover. 

I looked at the other envelope and hardly had to read it to figure it out.

The letterhead read: Atlantic Life Insurance. 

A policy had been opened in my name for a quarter of a million dollars. 

I stumbled over to the retaining wall and sat. 

“The pills.” I thought about the empty capsule he’d shown me that I tossed aside. It was my emergency Albuterol. It had to be. A quick WebMD search showed that an overdose started with symptoms of headaches and heart palpations. 

“Angie is trying to kill me?”

Suddenly I realized Tall Frank’s arm was around me and he was patting my shoulder paternally. 

We sat there in silence for a long time. 

“The things you can learn from people’s recycling.” I said.

Tall Frank nodded and we watched the upstairs light turn on and my wife appeared in the window. She twisted something in her fingers and then tapped it into a mug.

A minute later I heard the back door open. 

“Honey are you out here?” Angie called. “I made you some tea!”

I guess the homeless around her don’t always want change. Sometimes they might want to [save your life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",Entertainment
nosleep,The Ringing In My Ear,"I remember the day I started to lose my hearing. I remember it because two things had happened the day before; I'd received a particularly painful numbing injection at the dentist's office prior to having some work done and my daughter was raped and left for dead in a dumpster just outside her college campus.


We got the call at 4 AM. Being woken like that, by a shrill ringing in the otherwise still and quiet dark, is something no one should have to experience. You know before you pick up that something has happened, that something life changing is about to be dropped in your lap, and all you can do is answer. 


""Mr. Barrister?"" The voice on the other end said. ""I'm sorry to call at this hour. It's about your daughter.""


I'll never forget those words or the icy way they wrapped around my heart. My daughter, my baby girl. I looked at my wife, she looked back at me, and she knew. If I never again hear the sound she made then, I will consider myself blessed. 


In the flurry of packing and finding a flight to get to Emily and all of the gut wrenching worry, I didn't even notice it at first. It wasn't until we were in the air and Helena was whispering prayers under her breath beside me that I heard it; a high pitched keen in my left ear that came in what I can only describe as short beeps. It reminded me of hearing test tones. 


I stuck my finger in my ear and wiggled it around, trying to lessen the sound, but it remained, steady and irritating and beeping. 


It was pushed to the back of my mind the moment we landed, however, and we raced from the airport to the hospital, where Emily was lying unconscious with a row of machines standing vigil at her bedside. I'd seen them countless times before, I knew what they each did and why they were attached to her, but in that moment, they were strange, mechanical monstrosities that made her look so small and frail.


As we sat there, stroking her hair and telling her how we loved her, I had a flashback to the only other time Emily had ever been in a hospital. She had been six, maybe seven, and it was bedtime. She wanted to stay up longer like her older brother, but I told her to stop jumping on her bed and to settle down for sleep. I turned my back for just a minute, I don't even remember why, and she slipped. Blood was pouring out of a nasty gash over her eye where she'd struck the headboard and she was screaming.


After we'd calmed her down and got a look at the wound, we agreed she'd need stitches. While Helena got her dressed, I called the hospital where I worked as an anesthetist and got ahold of one of my doctor buddies to let him know I was coming in. Helena stayed home with our son while I took Emily in.


""Is it gonna hurt?"" Emily asked from the backseat. She was staring at me in the rearview mirror, one eye covered by the cloth she was pressing against her forehead.


""No, I'll make sure it doesn't.""


""How?"" My little girl, ever the skeptic.


""Remember how we talked about how Daddy makes people go to sleep for his job?"" It had become something of a joke in our house; better behave or Daddy'll put you to sleep...*forever*!


""Yeah?""


""Sometimes I only make *part* of a person fall asleep. That way, the nice doctors can make them better and they don't even feel it!""


""You're gonna do that to me?""


""Yep.""


""And you're gonna stay with me the whole time?""


""Of course.""


She barely winced when I injected the local anesthetic and then fell asleep during the actual stitches. 


Emily was a tough little girl.


She was a tougher young woman. 


It took her three days to wake up. In that time, the hearing in my left ear had started to fade until the only thing I could hear with absolute clarity was that high pitched ringing I'd first noticed on the plane.


*Beep. Beep. Beep.*


I couldn't worry about it just then, though, not when my family needed me so badly, and I didn't mention it to anyone. 


Emily's recovery was a slow process. She claimed not to remember who had attacked her and said she couldn't offer any description or statement to the police. She was tightlipped about what happened, even with her mother, with whom she'd shared everything. My carefree, forever smiling daughter was now haunted and every time she looked at me, there was such pain etched deeply into her eyes. 


I'd never felt so helpless or hollow.


After she was released from the hospital, she quietly withdrew from school and moved back in with me and her mother, where she spent most of her days shut away in her room.


All the while, the deafness and ringing in my ear continued.


*Beep. Beep. Beep.*


Still, I put off going to get it checked out. I figured it was some kind of screw up from the dentist's injection and there wouldn't be much that could be done about it anyway. It would be almost impossible to prove. 


My focus was entirely on Emily and helping her in any way I could, my own issues be damned. We got her into therapy, we researched healing techniques, we devoted ourselves entirely to her physical and mental health in every way she would allow. It took months, but she started to smile again, the night terrors started to recede, and, piece by piece, our Emily started to come back to us.


We had just started discussing whether she felt comfortable enough to return to school when things began to unravel.


Emily had come to the hospital where I worked to have lunch with me. We were sitting in the cafeteria, our trays of food untouched in front of us while we talked about what courses she might like to take. She was in the middle of telling me about a genealogy class she was interested in when she froze, mid sentence, and the color drained from her face.


""Kiddo? You ok?""


I followed her fixed stare back to the register line, where a trio of people were waiting to pay for their food, and then looked back to her.


""I need to go."" She said suddenly.


""What's wro-""


""Love you, Dad."" 


She practically ran out of the cafeteria.


I turned back to the three at the register. Two I recognized, the chief of medicine and an oncologist, but the third I didn't know. He was a young man around Emily's age and the passing resemblance he bore the chief led me to believe he was a relative of some sort, probably a grandson.


The longer I looked at him, the louder the ringing in my ear became.


*Beep. Beep. Beep.*


When I got home that night, Emily was sitting on the back porch, staring off vacantly while our dogs wandered about the yard. She jumped when I opened the slider and took a seat next to her.


""You ok?"" I asked.


""Yeah."" She said.


The silence that fell between us was a heavy one. 


""About today..."" I started to say.


""Victor."" She said quietly.


I didn't say anything, afraid to interrupt and cause her to shut down again.


""He goes to the same university. We had a biology class together."" Every word sounded like it was being torn forcibly out of her. ""We found out were from the same area so we talked a few times about classes and how you and his Grandpa work for the same place and then we...traded pictures and stuff.""


""And stuff"" was clearly things that no father ever wants to think of his daughter doing. I just nodded.


""It was going too fast, though, so I...I told him I wanted to just be friends again. He didn't like that. He told me if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd share the pictures I sent him."" Her voice cracked and she turned away from me. ""That's illegal now in a lot of places, though, and I said I'd make sure he got in trouble. He got angry.""


Victor had cornered her outside a club and tried to get her to go home with him. When she refused, he became violent. He'd dragged her into alleyway and attacked her. 


""He said if I ever told, he'd share all of our texts so people would know I wanted it and he'd make sure you were fired and that your career would be over."" Emily was shaking with sobs. ""His grandpa's the chief of medicine, he could've done it!""


I pulled her in close and held her while she cried. 


No matter how much I tried to tell her that we needed to call the police, she refused. 


""I can't, Dad."" She said. ""He has texts and pictures. No one would believe me.""


The next day when I went in to work, I went straight to the chief of medicine's office. I didn't know what I was going to do or say, I just had to do *something*. I had barely knocked on the door when he called me in. 


Before I could speak, Dr. Gladson looked up and said, ""Oh, good, Martha found you. I wanted to talk to you about my grandson, Vic. He's having surgery this afternoon, nothing too serious, but I'd like you to be his anesthetist. I'd ask Taylor, but he's already scheduled.""


I almost said no. I almost shouted that his damn grandson was a monster. I almost told him I'd sooner see him dead. 


Instead, I took a deep breath and said, ""Of course.""


""Good. It's at 2:30 with Dr. Lim.""


As I turned to leave, the ringing in my left ear seemed so loud that it was almost throbbing.


*Beep. Beep. Beep.*


At 2:30, as promised, I was seated at the head of the surgery table behind the ether screen. Victor, a good looking kid with a cocksure attitude about him, was lying in front of me.


""Hello, Victor."" I said.


""Hi.""


He wasn't at all nervous, which told me he didn't know who I was. It didn't surprise me, not many people bothered to learn the anesthetist's name.


""Is this your first surgery?""


""Nope.""


""So you know how anesthesia works?""


""Count back from ten, yeah.""


""Yes.""


I made small talk while I set up, asking him about where he went to school and what he was majoring in. When it came time to put on his mask and count down, I asked him one more question.

*10*

""I think you might know my daughter.""

*9*


""Yeah?"" 


*8*


""Yeah. Emily.""


*7*


""Oh yeah, I think so.""


*6*


""She ever tell you what I do for a living?""


*5*


""Maybe?"" He was getting drowsy.


*4*


""I put people to sleep for a living, Vic."" I was whispering.


*3*


""Huh?"" He was struggling to stay awake.


*2*


""Sometimes permanently.""


*1*


The beeping in my ear was especially loud then and, slowly, I realized that it was echoing. I looked up at his heart monitor, sitting not too far over my head, and it beeped in time with the ringing in my ear.


*Beep. Beep. Beep.*


The surgery went well for about twenty minutes, until Victor experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure. The shock to his system sent him into a violent seizing fit and the surgeon was barking orders, demanding this and that to stabilize the boy. 


But there was nothing that could be done.


Anesthesia overdoses can be such terrible, tricky things.


As the staff struggled to revive him and I made a show of doing the same, the steady rhythm of the ringing in my ear changed for the first time.

*Beep. Beep. Beep. Beeeeeeep.*


Victor was pronounced dead at 3:02 PM.


At the same time the heart monitor was turned off, the ringing in my ear ceased and sound returned to it in a loud, almost painful burst. 


I was glad for the surgical mask, then, as they covered Victor with the white sheet.


No one could see that I was smiling.",Entertainment
nosleep,"I work as a waitress at a diner, and I think one of our regulars might be the devil","I work at a rest-stop diner in a town people pass through as quick as they can on their way to something, or someone, better. It’s called Lucky’s, which is a little ironic because if you’ve ended up here you’re anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky’s you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I’ve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my “Where you heading?” has been “Anywhere but back.” The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee’s hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they’ll ever have, and I’m inclined to agree. 

The embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain’t even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky’s has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It’s like she’s still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn’t buried in the cemetery just past the strip club. 

Lucky’s is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there’s nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky’s I’ve seen all sorts of lost things. 

I once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining. 

I’ve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I’ve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I’ve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don’t look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can’t quite hold up the pretence that long. I’ve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I’ve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I’d consider letting them harvest me. 

But this is a story about - well, you read the title. 

It was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I’m going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I’d taste salt on the air. That, and I’m one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky’s, and only two had showed so far. 

Rose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky’s when sleep was hiding from her. 

She continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she’d read your coffee grounds. I didn’t ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true. 

Table 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.

Our second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I’d ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.

He smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms. 

Sometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn’t take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet. 

“Tired today?” I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he’d pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he’d been dreaming about her. She’d been found without her shoes on. He’d carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on ‘em, small in his arms like she was asleep.  

Lou the fry cook had cried when I’d told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we’re always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there’s a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart. 

“Always tired,” Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself. 

I walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while. 

The other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he’d used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he’d look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he’d done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He’d never seen the ocean. 

Lou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get. 

They often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies’ guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them. 

I cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads. 

Neither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims. 

“I know where I buried him Sylvia-,”
“You don’t know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-”

My mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn’t there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it’s not polite to listen to other people’s conversations. You never know what you’ll wish you hadn’t heard. 

Lou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone. 

Carlos handed me a plate of pancakes. 

Carlos had worked here so long he’d known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky’s pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn’t working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I’d learnt that the hard way, but that’s another story. 

Along with the pancakes, came a warning. 

“He’s back.” He gestured through the doors. “Table 6.” 

Our final regular had showed. It had been a while since he’d been around. I hadn’t even seen him come in, but that wasn’t unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page. 

We leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. “Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.” Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.

I don’t get paid enough for this shit. 

I took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I’d looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.  

I tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There’s something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl. 

“Can I get you anything?” I asked, faking bright. 

“I’d take your name.” He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush. 

I tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth. 

“Isabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don’t suit.” He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed. 

“There’s no need for that,” came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince. 

I turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you’ve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn’t want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you’re gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people. 

Mr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn’t notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you’d think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South. 

“I’m sorry for my… acquaintance. He’s a little…” Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. “…over excited.” Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.  

Mr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they’re watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn’t moved. 

“Besides, Leroy ain’t the type for salt. He’s just a man.” He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. “Barely.” He turned to Leroy. “I see you started on my pancakes. But what’s the point of good food if it ain’t for sharing.” Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system. 

Mr Prince handed Leroy a menu. “Order whatever you want.” He leant forward and the lights flickered.

Leroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. “Well, if that’s all!” I managed. I could feel Leroy’s eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen. 

“I wouldn’t worry about him, darlin’.” She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. “We won’t be seeing him again.” She wasn’t talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.  

I finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water. 

“Lou! Jesus fuckin’ Christ, get off I’m-“ I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. “I think I’m good.” I wasn’t really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession. 

“Sorry! Just checkin’.” Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. “Already did me ’n’ Carlos.” He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.

Carlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. “Maybe you need some more,” I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted. 

Sometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.

It was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I’d been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic. 

“You taste better than they will,” he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I’d left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince’s plate.

“Tell Carlos the pancakes were… good as hell,” he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he’d said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.

I walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.

“Is he botherin’ you?” He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two.
“Nothing I can’t handle,” I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. “We won’t be seeing him again.” 

It felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don’t look at him, he doesn’t bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary. 

At 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat. 

“See Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,” he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. “For I will not acquit the wicked,” he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy’s hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child’s shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head. 

He seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. “For your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.”  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over. 

Mr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. “We’ve got a ways to go, the road we’re takin’. They say it’s paved with good intentions.” He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy’s hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again. 

I placed the shoes on the table by Jone’s empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there’s nothing left to say. 

My shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything.",Entertainment
nosleep,A recipe for happiness,"On my tenth birthday, I picked a dog from the pound. The pound had several beautiful dogs – huskies and German shepherds, sleek bluenose pit bulls and even a redbone hound – but the dog that caught my eye was a bowlegged teacup Chihuahua with wiry fur and ears that seemed to sprout from his neck.

His fur was prickly and he smelled like soggy corn chips. He also ate flies, snatching them out of the air like a clumsy frog.

So I named him Renfield.

Back then, we lived on five acres of golden forest. My favorite spot on the property was a hollow inside a wild hedge. It was the perfect hideout; you could only access the hollow by crawling along a hidden trench because the branches formed a thick, dangerous interlock on all sides.

I took Renfield inside the hedge that night. I remember the way sunlight shafted through the leaves and flowers, turning the space into a burrow of soft brown shadows overlaid with coppery light. My little dog looked up at me, eyes shining like amber in the dim. 

I petted him until he fell asleep. Then I crawled out of the hollow and called his name, intending to confuse him.

He panicked immediately, yelping and clawing madly at the impenetrable branches.

His terror felt like a gut punch. I crawled back into the hedge. The way he looked at me is burned into my memory: wide-eyed and joyfully relieved, but terrified. 

That look was all I could think of the day I put him to sleep.

I didn’t have a choice; I’d have him for eighteen years, and had medicated severe heart issues for four of those. He was in constant pain, so it was time.

But he knew something was wrong. He was so scared, and I scared him even more by crying. Tears always terrified him. 

I tried to push away the memory of that first night in the hedge, of the way I’d scared him. But I couldn’t, and no wonder. Putting him to sleep, I’d trapped him again.

Only this time, I had to leave him behind.

He was my last lifeline. I felt him slipping away as surely as a drowning man feels a wave carry away his life preserver.

My crybaby tendencies didn’t start or end with my dog. Take my dad. He’d been in a nursing home for years by that point. He developed Alzheimer’s early. The descent was brutal and swift. As if that wasn’t enough, he had pancreatic cancer – automatically terminal and unimaginably excruciating.

I stopped visiting around that time. Not because I didn’t want to see him, but because I couldn’t do it to him. Just try to imagine – you’re in horrific pain, you don’t know who or where you are, and your only visitor is a gaunt stranger who bursts into tears whenever they see you.

I scared him to death whenever I visited. I made his disorienting, painful days that much worse. Stole what little peace he had.

So I stopped.

I meant to sit with him at the end, when he’d be in a drug-induced sleep so deep he wouldn’t notice me holding his hands and sobbing. But I wasn’t there when he died. I was at my doctor’s office, digesting the news that I, too, was going to be sick for the rest of my life. 

I dreamed about my dad that night. He was trapped in the hedge and screaming for help. I tried to show him the way out for what felt like hours, but I was invisible. He couldn’t see me or hear me. As far as he knew, he was alone. Somehow, in that irrepressible logic of dreams, I knew it was my fault.

I woke up crying.

It was enough. I’d had *enough*.

I’m not stupid or naïve. Life is a tide. And the shitty truth is some of us live on a stormy coast.

I knew this.

But I wanted a break. Just a couple of hours where I didn’t feel sad.

So I went online, hoping to stumble on some kind of guided imagery technique or hypnotic ASMR. Something to create an artificially happy place, at least for a little while.

I tried everything. Nothing worked. I kept searching anyway, trawling increasingly weird websites far into the night because the search itself was addicting. Not a happy place, but certainly a distracting one.

Sometime in the middle of the fifth night, I found an ancient Geocities page titled:

*a recipe for happiness*

I clicked, of course.

*Are you tired of feeling bad? Want to cheer up? Well have I got good news for you. My friend gave me this RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS that works like a charm!*

*There are TWO PARTS to the Recipe*

What followed was a pretty standard honey cake recipe, although the last instructions gave me pause:

*Mix the ingredients together in a glass bowl, then spit in the mixture*

*Cook at whatever temperature you want for EXACTLY 20 minutes*

*Cut in half. Put half outside your door. Eat the other half during…*

*PART TWO!!*

*Take one HAPPY MEMORY and MEDITATE*

*Think of someone who makes you happy*

*Plan a perfect day*

*Go to sleep thinking about your perfect day*

*Do this and your sorrow will be eaten away!!!*

It made me smile. Eating cake while meditating on happier times wasn’t bad advice. So I gave it a try. I even spit in the cake batter.

I cut the cake and set half of it on the porch. Tendrils of steam twirled into the darkness, lit pale silver by the full moon. 

I curled up the couch to eat the remaining half. For my happy memory, I chose that first evening in the hollow: my little dog, lit to soft brilliance by the dying sun.

As for someone who made me happy, I picked my dad.

Then I planned a perfect day. Or rather, remembered it.

I’d just started my first real job, and still lived with my parents. I’d had a good day at work. My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn’t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.

Afterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.

As I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes. 

When I woke, that warm weight had shifted to my pillow.

A terrible, painful hope coursed through me, one I couldn’t even acknowledge.

I opened my eyes.

Something tiny lay on my pillow in a drying pool of blood. Fuzzy and weirdly dirty, exuding drifting grey filaments that sparkled in the sun. Three milky eyes glinted over a horror show of a snout: cracked and bleeding, bursting with an improbable cluster of human molars. 

It blinked – each eye just slightly out of tandem, opening and closing with a soft, wet *click* - and smiled. Ropes of bloody drool leaked between its teeth. It placed two cold paws on my face.

Then it lowered its mouth over my own and inhaled.

Breath and blood and every organ in my body seemed to travel up my esophagus. Like God Himself was sucking my guts through a straw.

I whipped my head from side to side as the awful bottleneck sensation intensified.  All my guts were coming up, and so were emotions - no, *memories*: half-forgotten nightmares. Painful images of my withered father. The last time I saw my mother, dressed for work and setting a bowl of oatmeal on the counter while driving rain fell.  And my dog, my poor little dog, trying to run from the needle up until the very end.  

I screamed into the mouth of the monster. I expected it to fly off, but it *inflated*: a furry flesh balloon growing, growing, growing –

Without warning, it let go.

I stumbled back, gagging. The monster – an engorged orb the size of a German Shepherd – simply smiled. Hazy morning light filtered through the window, bathing it in soft white.

Rage inexplicably built in my chest, growing exponentially every second.

“Are,” it croaked, then burped.

I wanted to kill it, to plunge my arms elbow-deep into its disgusting, distended body, and –

“Are you sad?” it asked.

A storm of emotion – rage, disgust, contempt, even hilarity – roiled through me. Overwhelming, overpowering, and paralyzing.

“No. You have no sadness.” It poked its belly with a ridiculousy small hand. “I have it.”

It took a long, long time, but I finally realized that this absurd abomination hadn’t eaten my guts.

It ate my feelings.

No sadness. No pain. No more stinging memories. Rage and confusion, sure. But underneath that was a satisfied calm akin to bliss.

I left it alone in my bedroom and went for a drive.

When I came back, I asked, “What are you?”

“A special treat,” it answered.

I decided I’d had a psychotic break, and voluntarily checked myself into a hospital. After two days of assessments, they found nothing wrong. Why would they? I was on an even keel, basking in a curiously blank inner peace.

When I got home, the monster was in my bed. Jolly, indecent roundness had withered to skeletal proportions. It looked awful. Starved. 

“I need,” it gasped. “I need, or you will suffer again.”

The prospect of returning to a life of despair, of *loss*, was crushing; I couldn’t even fathom how I’d survived it in the first, and felt I’d never be able to do it again.

So I knelt by the bed and opened my mouth. The monster latched on and inhaled. The unpleasant bottleneck sensation returned: like my insides were crowding my windpipe. And with it, memories and feelings: the rage I’d experienced upon meeting the monster; contempt at its ugliness; the fear of insanity. And more: my dog, old and grey, waddling happily after me. My father in his hospital bed, smiling uncertainly as he said my name for the last night. And more, and more –

I wrenched away, gasping. The monster smiled, fat and rotund again.

Over the following days, we developed a routine. I went to work and attended doctor appointments, even visited friends. Then I came home and let the monster extract my negative feelings. Bad client at work? Removed and forgotten before the memory could sink in. Friend who wouldn’t make eye contact? What did I care, my pet monster would take care of it like he took care of everything else.

That’s what it did, you see: removed the feelings, the vibrancy, the *pain,* from painful things. Over the course of several weeks, it removed everything; I knew, dimly, that I experienced awful things on a daily basis, but I didn’t *remember* them.

The monster removed triggers, too: before the year was up, the sight of my dog’s bed no longer made me cry. Photos of my parents held almost no interest; I flipped through them on a regular basis, skimming places and faces that had so recently crushed me.

All the while, that peaceable bliss intensified. I flitted through life in a pleasant haze of calmness. My work life improved. My supervisor started talking about a promotion because I was so unflappable, so decisive. My friends were able to look at me again. And – for the first time in months – I was confident enough to reach out to them. 

One day as I drove home from work, I realized I hadn’t looked at my photos in a very long time. It’s not that I cared, exactly. But it was a deviation. Those things no longer caused me pain, and I had nothing better to do.  So why not view them?

I got home and obediently kneeled. The monster – now the size of a horse, twisted and bent like a mutated spider – fixed its mouth over mine. I’d come to enjoy the process. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, but familiar. And afterward, I always felt *happy*: peaceful, empty, and warm.

When it finished, I opened my mother’s photo album and began to browse.

After a while, I realized I didn’t recognize anybody. I remembered remembering them.

But I didn’t remember them.

The stout man with curly hair like mine, the athletic woman who smiled like me, and the numerous people who wove in and out of this photographic narrative…they all were strangers. 

I reached a picture of my ten-year-old self cuddling a ragged, homely Chihuahua. Ghosts of memories tickled my brain, urging me to remember, urging me to *know.* 

And I understood, finally, that I had lost something.

I don’t know why I cared. I felt so happy. Peaceful. My life was painless. I was great.

But I was also selfish. And I didn’t like the idea that the monster had taken so much.  Where was the line between happiness and emptiness? I didn’t want to be empty. I wanted to be full.

So, after many days of deliberation, I decided to make a change.

I called off work, canceled much-needed doctor appointments, and settled in to search online.

“What are you doing?” the monster asked.

“Looking up some special recipes,” I said with a bland smile.

It took seven days, but I found the original recipe. At the bottom of the page was another entry:

*a recipe for sadness*

Underneath were the words:

*If you’re really dumb, you can undo happiness =( You shouldn’t, but it’s up to you. So here.*

*Mix cake batter folloing the INSTRUCTIONS above*

*Cut your hand and drip your blood into the batter*

*Cook the cake as instructed Above*

*Cut the cake in half*

*Give half to your Happiness, and eat the other half*

*Now here’s the sad part!!*

*Remember the happy memory you meditated on*

*Remember the person who made you happy*

*Remember your perfect day*

*Choose one to forget, OR…*

*Choose to never be happy again*

*Or better yet, don’t kill your happiness in the first place!*

I agonized for days.

My monster – my happiness, my joy – continued to drain my pain, uncertainty, and fear. He quickly grew to three times his size.

Finally, I made my decision.

It would be better to live in pain forever than to forget my father, my mother, or my dog.

So I followed the recipe: sweet honey cake, poisoned with blood instead of saliva. Then I cut it in half and brought it to my monster.

I expected something awful. A fight that left my bloody shreds ground into the carpet. 

But the monster only smiled. Round, flat eyes the size of dinner plates fixed on the blood cake. “What is that?”

“A special recipe.” I gulped, but the beast was so focused on the cake that it didn’t notice. “Just for you.”

“Thank you.” It opened its mouth.

I placed the cake delicately on its tongue. It chewed eagerly, and shrank. Fat, firm sides caved, ragged rolls of empty flesh falling against its bones.

Pain built in my guts and chest, roiling and fluttering. Shivers wracked my spine. My warm, even-keeled peace shrank along with the monster that had granted it, leaving cold desolation in its place. 

By the time the monster shriveled into a flat, boneless mass of dusty fur, I was prostrate on the floor, sobbing. Memories flooded back, pummeling me, leaving me breathless with pain. They pressed against me and threatened to explode *out* of me, pinning me in place. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even dream of moving.

I could only lay there and hurt.

After my dad died, someone told me that pain is a fugue. It’ll break apart eventually, giving way to happiness again the way a nightmare opens to the morning. But my experience is opposite. There is no fugue. Sorrow is sharp, it is devastating, it is painfully present, and sometimes there’s no way out.

The recipe writer was right. I suffer every day, more than I did before. Like the universe is punishing me for those few months of stolen peace. It’s bad. So bad that sometimes I think I made the wrong choice. 

But then I remember my dad. I remember my mom. I remember our perfect day filled with songs and bad jokes and warm, driving rain. 

I remember my dog, nestled in warm, coppery shadows.

And even though I hurt, I am okay.

The Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 12/02/2017

Silence used to be an absolute. 

That’s something I definitely miss.

Back in the real world, it would stand as self-evident that a group of people saying absolutely nothing, by definition, could not be saying any less. Maybe things are different on the road, maybe I’d just never encountered it before, but it’s clear to me now there are degrees beyond silence. A pervasive realm of deafening quiet which, following the loss of Eve and Apollo, our group has unreservedly embraced. Constructed out of our collective trauma, cemented with a cruel mixture of grief, guilt, and harrowing self-doubt, it quickly becomes apparent that this silence is stronger than all of us. The challenge of breaking it remains unmet for the rest of the journey.

We spend the next few hours burrowing through a featureless corridor of maize. The stalks rise far above the Wrangler, leaving only a thin strip of clear sky visible like the painted ceiling of a renaissance church. I find myself glancing intermittently at the CB radio, half expecting, half hoping, for Apollo’s voice to crackle through the speaker, bringing words of comfort, or a much needed attempt at levity.

After I catch myself staring at the radio for the fifth time, I decide it might be best to get on with my work. I plug my headphones into my notebook, bring up the audio files I’ve recorded thus far, and set about creating a very rough cut of our first day on the road.

**APOLLO (VO)** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha

I listen through Apollo’s first interview, making notes for the closing paragraph I’ll now be forced to write about him. When I have everything I need, I listen to the interview again, and then once more. It’s not lost on me that I just want to hear his voice, to lose myself in a pleasant digital echo, far removed from the frantic screams that followed him into the asphalt.

I listen to Eve’s interview next. She bristles with excitement as she talks about her upcoming visit to Roswell, steadfastly attempting to recruit me to the effort. She had no idea what she was heading into when she stepped out onto Rob’s front lawn. Then again none of us did.

The thin strip of sky is turning deep orange as I reach our encounter with the hitchhiker. It’s chilling to hear his voice after the fact, to revisit the conniving, veiled pleasantries he employed against us. I cringe as I hear Rob’s hand grasp my arm, ashamed that I let myself fall for the hitcher’s trickery.

**ROB (VO):** You did good, I’m sorry for grabbin’ you. I just didn’t want you to do something you’d regret.

**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?

**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s got you? I don’t think I wanna know.

**AS (VO):** Rob, I-

I pause the audio file, clicking back ten seconds before pressing play again.

**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?

**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s-

I certainly didn’t notice that at the time. I’d been so shaken by my run in with the hitcher, and so curious about the abandoned car that I’d been completely blind to anything else that had come my way. Maybe Rob misspoke, maybe he meant to say weeks or months. But if it wasn’t a mistake, if it was a truth carelessly uttered, then Rob has some explaining to do.

The Left/Right Game was posted online in June 2016, less than a year ago.

I glance sideways at him, a wall of corn rushing past us as we approach the rest stop. Throughout this trip, every emotion Rob’s displayed has seemed genuine. The sadness, the anger, the concern. They tell a story of a man who cares deeply about the welfare of those around him. Yet at the same time, it’s strikingly clear that there’s something he isn’t telling me.

With every new piece of the puzzle, the car, the text message, the faceless creature with the ringing phone, I’m left with the dilemma of when to confront Rob Guthard with what I know. I feel I’ve gathered enough to bring before him, enough to demand an explanation, but there’s no way I’d be able to truly verify his answer. I have a collection of strange and perplexing notions, lacking in the common thread that could bring me to any workable conclusion. If I am going to confront Rob, I need to uncover that thread. Much like the greatest journalists of our time, I should know the answer before I ask the question.

The jeep pulls up onto a large green space. Staring straight ahead, I find myself puzzled by the way the ground seems to stop, as if the horizon lies only twenty metres away from the car. As soon as the engine cuts out, I unbuckle my seatbelt, climb out and walk towards the grassy verge. The rest of the convoy pulls up behind me as I go.

I stop a few steps short of the edge, realising we’ve found our way to the top of a sheer cliff. A sudden swaying vertigo takes over, forcing me to take a few steps back. It doesn’t feel like we’ve been heading uphill, the road has been level since Jubilation, yet somehow I’m standing at the edge of a 400 ft. rock face, descending straight downwards, the distant earth shrouded by stalks of corn.

That’s the truly strange thing about this monolithic precipice. On either side of me, the maize runs to the very edge of the cliff and, at its base, the endless harvest continues until it stretches beyond the darkening horizon in every direction. It feels like I’m standing on the cliffs of Dover, staring over a golden ocean, its waves governed by the evening breeze. I wonder for a moment where it ends, then, taking consideration of the world I now occupy, I start to wonder if it ever does.

A belligerent scream rips me from the view. The source of the noise is blocked by the Wrangler and the first thing I see as I circle around are the shocked, wide eyed faces of Bonnie & Clyde. Once I make my way past the Wrangler’s hood, my expression mimics theirs.

Lilith has pinned Bluejay up to the side of the Jeep, a locked forearm pressing her chest against the door. Her other arm has been grasped in Bluejay’s hands, desperately stopped before it can strike her across the face. The two of them yell through gritted teeth as Lilith struggles furiously against her, vying to cause her any conceivable harm.

**BLUEJAY** Get the fuck off me you bitch! Get off!

I take a few quick steps over to Lilith as Bluejay attempts to kick her away.

**AS:** Lilith, we can’t do this… Jen…

Lilith doesn’t even register my presence as she continues her assault, deafened by the bubbling vitriol in every growling breath.

**AS:** Jen! We are not doing this now. Not after-

Before I can comprehend what’s happening, I’m staring at the sky, my head knocked back by the force of Lilith’s flailing elbow. A hot, raw ache radiates across my lower lip as I stagger back, raising my hand over my mouth.

Before Lilith can continue her assault, Rob swings open his door and takes two short strides over to her. He puts one arm around the girl’s waist and picks her up, carrying her safely, but firmly, over to Bonnie & Clyde’s Ford, and planting her back on the ground.

I seem to always forget how strong he is.

**ROB:** Damnit this is not the time.

**LILITH:** Take it back!

Bluejay has lost her usual snide demeanour, yet her aura still radiates an unbridled scorn. In response to Lilith’s demand, Bluejay walks back to her car and sits on the hood. She takes the Marlboros out of her pocket along with her lighter, and ignites a cigarette. I imagine the burning embers are the only company she’s comfortable to accept right now.

By the time I look back to the rest of the group, Lilith has stormed away.

**AS:** What did she say?

**BONNIE:** I didn’t hear it all.

**AS:** What did she say Bonnie?

**BONNIE:** I heard something about… she said Lilith was… that we were complicit.

**ROB:** Ah goddamnit… Bristol can you…

I watch Lilith, as she sits on the grass and looks over the cliffside. She begins to cry, yet I get a strong notion that it’s not something I should interrupt. It feels like something between her and Eve, a final act of reactionary mourning reserved for them, and them alone. 

**AS:** Yeah… don’t worry. I’ll handle it.

**ROB:** Ok. I’ll cook us somethin’ up.

An hour passes. Lilith grows slowly calmer, drifting from cathartic release into a cold, wordless melancholy. Finishing up my dinner, I make my way over to her.

**AS:** It’s a strange view.

Lilith looks up at me. Her face falls.

**LILITH:** I cut you… I’m so sorry.

**AS:** It’s fine. You should see the other girl.

**LILITH:** Hah, yeah, I bet she looks like shit right about now.

I help myself down onto the cool ground, staring alongside Lilith into the ocean below.

**LILITH:** Bluejay thinks I’m complicit… in what happened to Eve.

**AS:** I heard.

**LILITH:** She used to think we were morons, now she thinks we’re all in on it… doesn’t make sense.

**AS:** I think she he has to believe this place is a lie. She needs it to make sense, and the harder it gets for her to rationalise the more she... Anyway, she shouldn’t have said what she said. She’s just... I guess the word is ""troubled"".

**LILITH:** She’s a fucking thundercunt.

**AS:** Umm… uh… ok.

**LILITH:** She’s right though... I killed her... and I killed Apollo too.

I look to Lilith, concerned, not quite sure what she means. Her eyes remain locked on the impossible horizon.

**LILITH:** Sarah… she wasn’t cut out for this, and she knew it. She wanted us to turn back this morning… but I didn’t want to.

**AS:** That wasn’t just your decision Lilith.

**LILITH:** Yes it was. She uh… she followed my lead. Always. Through everything. And I knew why she was doing it. I knew. But I let it continue, because it was convenient, because it was easy…. because deep down I liked having someone around who… who’d jump through fucking hoops for me… god it’s so fucked.

Lilith rests her head in her hands.

**LILITH:** She was weak. She was anxious and shy and… but that should be ok, right? You’re allowed to be weak that’s… but I made her come here. I dragged someone who couldn’t swim into the fucking deep end. And the last thing I did was lie to her and she fucking knew it.

Lilith takes a few deep, frayed breaths.

**AS:** What do you mean?

**LILITH:** I’m not uh… I didn’t, I… I loved her, you know as a… as a friend. It was always this fucking one-way street and… I don’t think she minded but. Then suddenly she’s vanishing right in-fucking-front of me and she said what she said… I mean how else was I supposed to respond to that? I had to say it back right?

Lilith maintains her composure as a steady stream of tears roll down her cheek.

**AS:** I don’t know what I’d do in that situation.

**LILITH:** I could see it in her eyes that she didn’t believe me. Fuck… I wonder how many people have died while being told like… comforting lies. How many of them fucking knew?

**AS:** I think you did the best you could Jen. I think you did better than most.

**LILITH:** You don’t need to tell me that just… are you tired? Do you need to go to bed soon?

**AS:** No, I don’t need to.

**LILITH:** There are some beers in uh… in Apollo’s bag. Is that like… looting? Or is that ok?

**AS:** I think he’d want us to have them, as long as he got a toast.

Lilith laughs briefly and finally smiles. She walks over to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, returning a moment later with a four pack.

We spend the next hour and a half slowly drinking them. Lilith can’t muster the right words for a toast so we just say thank you to Apollo, raising out cans to the open air. We talk about his tireless humour, his attempts to keep us all up during our first night on the road, how caringly he spoke to everyone, even at the edge of death. 

We talk about Eve as well, about the pair’s misadventures, awkward college parties and the future of Paranormicon. Lilith smiles, and tells me there’s always a place for me once radio dies out.

After everything that’s happened on the road, the night can’t help but feel bittersweet. But for once, on a solitary cliff side in the middle of nowhere, it’s more sweet than it is bitter. That may not be much, but at the end of an awful day it’s more than either of us could have hoped for.

*****

The next morning goes quickly. It’s amazing how efficient a group of people can be when none of them feel like talking. Not only that, but breakfast has become a noticeably brief affair. I manage to get through half a bag of trail mix before I find myself uncomfortably full. Rob’s words about the road’s sustaining properties ring in my ears as I look around the group. Everyone leaves their bowls half empty. Lilith hasn’t eaten a bite.

By this point, the launch protocol has been drilled into us. Despite our preoccupations, and the fractious rifts developing between us, the cars line up like clockwork as they merge onto the road. In fact, the mood of the group seems strangely procedural. All radio contact starts with the stating of a call sign, followed by that of the recipient. The cars maintain an even, careful distance between one another. We’ve seen all too clearly what happens when the rules are neglected, and no one wants to take chances any more.

**AS:** How far away are we?

**ROB:** From where?

**AS:** You haven’t got to the end of this road right? I mean… you’re still charting it?

**ROB:** That’s right.

**AS:** Well, how long until we get to… you know to… uncharted territory?

**ROB:** To be honest, not too long.

**AS:** What’s going to happen once we reach that point?

**ROB:** We’re gonna keep drivin’.

**AS:** Until we get to the end?

**ROB:** That’s the plan. You know I won’t judge you if you wanna turn around. I’m sure you can talk someone into it.

**AS:** Could I talk you into it?

Rob smiles.

**ROB:** ‘Fraid not. This trip ain’t like the others. Road’s kickin’ back like never before. I think it knows I’m comin’ all the way this time.

**AS:** … What is this place Rob?

Rob sighs as he slowly takes the next left on a quiet, rural T-junction.

**ROB:** I think it’s a stray thread… runnin’ off the spool.

The radio crackles.

**BONNIE:** Rob you just took the wrong turn.

An instant drum of fresh panic hammers in my chest. I stare at Rob, and he stares right back. I know he’s feeling the same thing I am, though he’s doing a much better job of keeping it off his face.

He thinks carefully for a moment.

**ROB:** No… no. I been down this road before. We took a right last time.

**AS:** Uhhh… yeah. Yes. The turn before this one was a right, I remember.

**ROB:** Ferryman to all cars. Thanks Bonnie for giving us the fright of our lives. We’re on the righ… we’re on the correct road.

**BONNIE:** No no that can’t be its… that’s wrong… Martin tell them…

**CLYDE:** Our mistake Rob, let’s keep going.

**LILITH:** Bristol…

There’s concern in Lilith’s voice. I lean over to my wing mirror, attempting to gauge the atmosphere in the car behind me. There’s clearly some commotion between Bonnie and Clyde, with the latter attempting to gently remove the walkie talkie from his sister’s hands.

There’s something else however. Past Bonnie & Clyde. Past Bluejay. An old, dilapidated road sign made of weathered timber stands by the side of the road behind us. I can’t read all of it as the peeling letters grow ever smaller, but I can piece together what it probably once said.

“Wintery Bay – 5 Miles”

**BONNIE:** We’re going to turn around right?

**AS:** Uhh one second Bonnie, I’ll… check the map.

I promptly switch off the radio.

**AS:** Are we not passing through Wintery Bay?

Rob turns to me, a puzzled look in his eyes.

**ROB:** Through where?

In the wake of those two, innocently inquiring words, my mind reels back to the morning of our third day on the road. Watching Bonnie and Clyde wander over to Rob to confess their transgressions with the hitchhiker, the quiet conversation that passed between them, Rob’s seemingly comforting response. I’d felt wretched in those moments. A few minutes prior I had tricked and deceived Clyde… yet I’d never once considered he might have done the same to me.

**AS:** Is it safe to pull over?

**ROB:** What? Why?

**AS:** Is it safe Rob?

**ROB:** Uh, yeah should be.

**AS:** Then pull over.

I switch the radio back on and grab the receiver. As I make a connection to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, it’s clear that an argument is brewing. Lilith is asking for me, a helpless passenger, caught in the middle of something she doesn’t understand.

**AS:** Bristol to all cars. We’re stopping up ahead.

Rob seems acutely aware that I’m not messing around. As soon as we roll to a halt, I throw my door open and jump onto the dusty roadside, striding over to the rest of the convoy, who are just starting to get out of their own cars. I’m conscious of a driving anger behind each step I take.

**AS:** You didn’t tell him.

**CLYDE:** Bristol, I…

**ROB:** What’s goin’ on Bristol?

Rob’s marches up behind me, more than a little restless to get a grip on my motives.

**AS:** Clyde?

Clyde looks around a circle of expectant eyes. When he delivers his answer, he’s unable to meet any of them.

**CLYDE:** Bonnie… Bonnie talked to the hitchhiker.

Rob’s expression shifts, his confusion degrading into a solemn understanding.

**ROB:** God… ahh Goddamnit. You knew about this Bristol?

**AS:** I told them to tell you the morning of the third day. I saw them go over to you I… I thought they did.

**CLYDE:** Bonnie… thought you’d… turn us around.

**ROB:** Well she’s was damn right. You seen what happens when the rules get broken. You shoulda told me as soon as you saw me and headed right back home.

**CLYDE:** That was before Ace… before everything. I didn’t know this place was-

**ROB:** The rules are the rules Clyde! Is anything even wrong with Bonnie? You said she gets confused... was that a lie?

Clyde doesn’t answer, avoiding Rob’s glare. As I process what Rob’s just said, I have to say I’m surprised by the deviousness of the two siblings.

When I thought they were telling Rob about the hitchhiker, it appears they’d instead told him that Bonnie was, to some degree, senile. It was a simple lie, but one that would adequately explain her odd behaviour, draw sympathy from Rob and, most ingeniously, prevent him from telling me about their conversation. A truth buried beneath an unpleasant lie, its subject matter just uncomfortable enough to head off any chance of discussion.

Still, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

**CLYDE:** We can head home if you want.

**BONNIE:** No.

The group turns to Bonnie. She speaks in a tone more decisive than I thought her capable.

**BONNIE:** He... the hitchhiker... he was talking about a… about the village we just passed. I was looking forward to seeing it, that’s all. I’m ok really.

**AS:** You’ve been talking about it a lot Bonnie.

**BONNIE:** It just sounded like a lovely place, I was sad that we passed it by. I’m sorry for worrying everyone. Please don’t make us turn around Rob.

Rob stares at them both. His position has been made crystal clear.

**ROB:** We’re stopping a little early today. Come the rest of the way with us, rest up… then tomorrow you both go home. You should count yourselves lucky you get the chance to turn around.

Rob marches back to the Wrangler, signalling that the discussion is over.

**ROB:** Lilith, you’re with us.

Lilith doesn't even try to hide her relief as she shuffles away from Bonnie & Clyde and climbs into the back of the Jeep. It’s a little heart warming that Rob still has the awareness to look out for her, angry as he may be.

As well as his surprising strength, I also tend to forget how perceptive he can be.

Bonnie, Clyde and Bluejay climb back into their respective vehicles. I catch Bonnie’s eye, the moment before she returns to the Ford. She appears truly disappointed, but otherwise resigned to keep going, satisfied to let Wintery Bay fade into the distance. It’s comforting to hear that she’s ready to put the place behind her.

It’s just a pity I don’t believe a word of it.

*****

**LILITH:** It was fucking weird Bristol.

Lilith seems happy to be in the Wrangler, enjoying the sense of security the modded behemoth affords, and also greatly relieved to be away from Bonnie & Clyde. She’s spent the last five minutes detailing the thirty second argument that unfolded between them, charting its disturbing nuances as well as it’s eerie conclusion.

**LILITH:** ... but I swear she was basically like crying like… she didn’t understand how we could be going the wrong way. But then like, as soon as you pulled us over and she just stopped. Like I mean… stopped.

**AS:** That must have been disconcerting.

**LILITH:** You have no idea... So Rob, when are these cornfields gonna fucking end?

**ROB:** Soon. We’re gonna rest up for the night in a few turns. Then tomorrow it won’t be long until we’re on a track through the woods.

**LILITH:** The fucking woods? Are you kidding? Are we talking like… Sleepy Hollow bleeding trees or what?

**ROB:** Hah, wish I could tell ya.

**LILITH:** Wait, what do you mean?

**ROB:** I ain’t been that far yet. It’s new territory.

**LILITH:** Oh… great. Maybe the cornfields aren’t so…

Lilith goes quiet, transfixed by something in the rear view mirror, before quickly turning around to get a better look out of the back window.

The car behind us is out of control.

Bonnie is fighting to wrest the steering wheel from her brother. The Ford swerves erratically behind us, driven mad by the dynamic power struggle taking place inside it. Rob sharply accelerates out of the way as the car behind lurches drunkenly to and fro before skidding to a shuddering halt. Rob hits the brake hard, and by the time I’ve turned in his direction, he’s already slammed the door of the Wrangler, storming across the tarmac to Bonnie and Clyde. 

**ROB:** Cut the engine!

The Ford’s engine goes silent and in the absence of its rumbling growl, new sounds emerge. The sounds of a struggle, and of wild desperate screaming.

Stepping out of the car for the second time today, I jump onto the road and cover the distance between us.

Rob is attempting to pull a screeching Bonnie from the car. Even with his impressive strength it seems to be a challenge. Bonnie claws at the walls, trying with all her might to regain her grasp on the steering wheel.

**BONNIE:** Please! PLEASE! Let me go! Let me go! 

Rob extracts Bonnie from the car and attempts to subdue her amidst a flurry of flailing hands and elbows. She writhes and kicks as he pins her arms to her sides.

**AS:** Bonnie! Bonnie. Calm down ok? Let’s talk this through.

**BONNIE:** He told me it was on our way! He said we’d pass through!

**ROB:** He lied Bonnie.

**BONNIE:** No… no we’re going the wrong way. We’re going the wrong way!

Bonnie lashes out again, striking at Rob’s legs with her own. Rob holds her firmly, hit teeth gritted through every impact.

It’s clear that Bonnie isn’t going to let up. I run back to the Wrangler and open up the trunk. After a few moments of rummaging through my bag, I find the first aid kit and pull out an unopened pack of white zip ties.

**AS:** Clyde, open the back door.

Rob sees me standing with the zip ties. Even in the midst of Bonnie’s incessant struggle, he looks at me with an almost questioning air, as if he’s wondering how we ever arrived at this point. As if he’s asking whether we can really do what I’m wordlessly suggesting.

Bonnie answers the last question for him. In the slim few seconds of distraction, she slams her head back into his nose, eliciting a disgustingly loud thud and a pained growl from Rob. Dazed and confused, his nose immediately fountaining blood, Rob manages to keep his arms wrapped around her. But it’s clear this isn’t going to be sustainable, and that she isn’t anywhere close to calming down.

Clyde has opened the door, stepping back and looking on like a frightened child as we carry Bonnie over to the back seat of the Ford. I lean in before him, adjusting the headrest until it’s pressed against the ceiling, ensuring that it can’t be removed from the bracket. I then loop a zip tie around each bracket and fasten them.

**BLUEJAY:** What the fuck is going on?

Bluejay has stepped out of her car, making her way towards us. I realise that, to someone who is fighting to not believe in any of this, the following scene would appear at best as a melodramatic farce, and at worst, as the attempted detention of an innocent and distressed woman.

Sadly, I don’t have time to field her questions. I climb into the car. Bonnie working constantly against us as Rob eases her in after me, his hand on her head to prevent it bumping against the top of the doorframe.

Once she’s inside, I loop a second zip tie around the one I’ve already fastened on the right bracket, forcing her right hand inside it. I pull the plastic tab over the sleeve of her jumper.

I hope it’s not too tight, but at the very least it’s secure enough to keep her in place. Bonnie continues to pull against the zip ties, but it’s clear her strength has been sapped from her spirited battle with Rob.

Not quite able to look her in the eye, I push a pile of luggage out of the way and climb out the other side of the Ford. Rob and I are both getting our breath back, the former pinching his nose and adjusting stoically to the fresh pain.

**BLUEJAY:** Hey what the fuck are… you’re not going to leave her like that are you?

**AS:** Get back in your car Bluejay.

I walk back to the Wrangler, tuning out Denise’s coarse protests. Rob reaches into the Jeep’s still open trunk, and pulls out a pile of blankets and pillows. In the rear view mirror, I can see him placing them on Bonnie’s lap, giving her a place to rest her elbows.

She leans her forehead against the back of the headrest. Even with her face blocked from view, I can tell that she’s crying.

We arrive at the rest stop some twenty minutes later, the vague outline of a deep green forest blooming on the horizon. It’s earlier in the day than we would usually stop. Rob tells us he wants the entirety of tomorrow to chart the woods, as well as good time to turn back before night fall should the need arise. I’m not complaining, I’m glad of the chance to rest up following today’s events.

For the rest of the day, we take it in turns to keep an eye on Bonnie, making sure she has everything she needs. When the Ford pulled up alongside us, Lilith, Rob, and I expected to see a quivering wreck, tugging ceaselessly against her bonds. We were all surprised, and more than a little disturbed, to find her smiling. By the time my turn comes around, the sun is already dipping in the sky. Rob has prepared a small pot of miso soup in case anyone can bring themselves to eat. I finish my bowl, all too aware of how unnecessary each meal now feels, and pour out a helping for Bonnie.

I find her in good spirits.

**BONNIE:** How are you doing Alice?

**AS:** I’m fine. How are you doing Linda?

**BONNIE:** I’m ok. Sorry for giving you all such a fright earlier. I feel terrible.

**AS:** It’s fine honestly. I’m sorry about… about all this.

I gesture to the zip tied restraints. Rob has reapplied them, fastening bandages underneath the straps to afford Bonnie a modicum of comfort. Still the scene rings with a sinister barbarity which no kind consideration can make up for. 

**BONNIE:** It’s ok. I wasn’t myself.

**AS:** I brought you soup. I know you might not be hungry.

**BONNIE:** No no I’d love some, thank you. Everyone’s being so lovely.

**AS:** Well, we just want to make sure you’re alright.

I submerge the spoon, drench up a measure of warm broth, and begin to raise it towards her.

**BONNIE:** Oh no you don’t have to… I can feed myself…

She gestures to her bound hands, the clear implication hanging in the air.

**AS:** No I… I don’t mind. I think it’s-

Bonnie throws her weight sideways, her elbow jabbing outwards and hitting the bowl out of my hands. Soup spills over my fleece, just a little cooler than scolding hot, and soaks immediately into the fabric. I back away reflexively, and watch Bonnie’s expression flicker like a faulty lightbulb from kind tranquility to utter, burning contempt. It’s gone as quickly as it appears, just in time for the rest of the group to look our way.

**BLUEJAY:** What are you doing with her?!

Bluejay storms across from her car, angrily drawing from a Marlboro and forcing the smoke draconically back into the air.

**AS:** Nothing. Just an accident.

**BONNIE:** It’s ok Bluejay, it was my mistake.

**BLUEJAY:** Did she get any on you?

Bluejay leans in placing her hand comfortingly on Bonnie’s, before turning to fix me with a murderous stare. It’s almost impressive how, even when caring for someone, Bluejay still manages to be simultaneously venomous to those around her.

**BONNIE:** No no it’s ok it was my fault. It’s fine. I’m sorry for causing trouble.

Bluejay laughs at Bonnie’s submissive apology, unable to believe what she's thinking. Her eyes remain fixed on me.

**BLUEJAY:** You’re a fucking coward. Look what he’s making you do. Look!

My eyes follow where she gestures. I have to admit the helpless figure of Bonnie, restrained in the back seat of the Ford, rings with an innate inhumanity, and being forced to stare my actions in the face makes me feel utterly ghoulish.

The choices I’ve made must seem insane to Bluejay, but that doesn’t mean hers are not. Despite her pretensions of rationality, I can’t help but feel that Bluejay’s actions are simply being governed by a different insanity. An insanity borne out of the desperate need to explain the unexplainable, which has morphed into an ugly cocktail of paranoia, self-grandeur, and fervent antagonism.

Bluejay notes my silent expression, most likely taking it as a personal victory. Without another word she returns to her car and shuts herself inside, festering silently and alone.

**BONNIE:** Do you want to know what’s wonderful Alice?

Bonnie leans towards me, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.

**BONNIE:** He told me there’s a house… waiting for me. My home by the sea.

**AS:** I’m sorry Bonnie. I don’t think there is.

**BONNIE:** It’s going to be a such a beautiful place. Such a beautiful place.

Bonnie flashes me a broad grin. 

**BONNIE:** It’s been lovely knowing you Alice.

Bonnie turns away from me, placing her forehead back on the headrest. The grin doesn’t fade as I turn away. I walk back to the Wrangler, faced with the choice of changing into new clothes or my thermal pyjamas.

After removing my fleece and lying down for a just a moment, I end up sleeping in the clothes I’m wearing.

*****

When I wake up, the Wrangler is moving. 

The air mattress reverberates and my body rocks as we make a sharp U-turn. I sit bolt upright, Lilith waking up next to me, similarly bleary eyed and confused.

Rob is behind the wheel. The gear stick shakes as he transports us down the road at incredible speed.

**AS:** Rob what’s happening?

**ROB:** Bonnie got herself free. She’s headed for the turn.

I pull myself into the passenger seat, suddenly wide awake.

**LILITH:** What? How did she get free?

**AS:** Is she with Clyde?

**ROB:** She hit him over the head, dragged him outta the car. I couldn’t wait for him, but he’s catchin’ up.

Lilith and I turn around. Bluejay’s car is gaining on us, a distant pair of high beams steadily drowning the rear window in light.

**LILITH:** Why’s Bluejay helping him?

**AS:** She probably wants to keep an eye on us. Rob, do you think we’ll catch up with Bonnie?

**ROB:** I’m workin’ on it.

The Wrangler continues to rocket through the darkness. We keep our eyes fixed forward, scanning the very edge of the horizon for any sign of Bonnie’s Ford.

When Bluejay pulls alongside us, I get a look at the pair. Bluejay is nought but steely determination, dedicated to reaching Bonnie before we do. Clyde looks mortified, rocked by his sister’s actions, a small contusion on his head to mark her vicious betrayal.

Rob screeches to a halt once we arrive at the junction. Bluejay’s headlights are already illuminating the road to Wintery Bay, and Rob’s lighting rig coats the entire area in an artificial twilight. In the middle of it all, we see Bonnie, standing next to her car, smiling.

She’s already beyond the threshold of the turn.

**CLYDE:** Linda! Linda, please… come on back now, ok?

**BONNIE:** You can all come with me. There’s a place for all of us. He told me. There’s a place for everyone.

**CLYDE:** Please Linda. You have to come back.

A strange trail of black dust is streaming off Bonnie’s skin, rising into the air and dancing in the breeze. After a moment, it becomes clear that the edges of Bonnie are slowly degrading, converting quietly into dark ash and drifting into the atmosphere.

**BONNIE:** I love you very much Martin. You’re always welcome.

**CLYDE:** No please… please.

Bonnie turns around and climbs into the car. Without looking back, she pulls away down the road to Wintery Bay. The trail of black particles rise from the Ford as she goes, with greater and greater volume as the entire car starts to wither away before our eyes. Less than a minute later the Ford, with Bonnie inside it, gradually dissolves into dust and scatters to the winds.

Clyde doesn't speak. His entire being is quiet. Lilith immediately runs back to the Wrangler. Rob waits a while, staring at he dancing cloud of dust, before putting his arm around Clyde and gently escorting him to the Jeep. 

As I turn away from the road to Wintery Bay, I take note of Bluejay’s reaction. She looks absolutely petrified, more so than I’ve ever seen her. She impulsively removes the pack of Marlboros from her pocket and holds them in her hands, before quickly returning them, unsmoked.

The night passes slowly after we return to the rest stop. All of us are exhausted, and more than willing to surrender to the escapism of sleep. Rob rests in the driver’s seat, giving up his space on the air mattress to Clyde. Everyone drops quickly enough into a quiet slumber, leaving me awake with only my thoughts for company. I find myself thinking of Bluejay, of how she could possibly hope to rationalise the disintegration of Bonnie and her car. 

I wonder how I’d feel if the Left/Right Game were exposed as some unparalleled magic trick. Would I feel foolish? No I don’t think so. Impressed, maybe. Relieved? Most definitely. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I miss the innocent days when I believed the game was a hoax. I suppose I see why Bluejay is so adamant about dismissing this place; trickery however elaborate is almost always a preferable alternative to genuine horror.

The Jeep’s door opens and shuts 

Part of me tries to ignore it, to wash my hands of any other developments in this harrowing night. However, exiled as I am from the kingdom of sleep, I slowly find myself sitting up, quietly putting on my boots, and letting myself out.

I step out into the cool night, observing the figure before me.

**AS:** Where are you going Clyde?

Clyde turns to face me, I initially interpret the look he gives me as one of resignation, but the word doesn’t quite fit. Resignation is a defeat, the world exacting compliance from you against your own wishes. But the man before me is as calm as the night air around him. His wishes are clearly his own. There’s no defeat in his eyes, but something else entirely… peace, maybe.

**CLYDE:** You know where I’m going Alice.

Clyde speaks softly, a quiet conviction behind every word he says. I briefly glance towards the Wrangler, wondering if I’m really equipped to handle this on my own.

**CLYDE:** Don’t call Rob. I made a mistake coming back to the rest stop. I shouldn’t have done... please. Just let me go.

**AS:** Clyde, just wait for tomorrow ok? He’ll understand. He’ll turn us around and take you home.

**CLYDE:** It won't be home anymore.

Clyde’s gentle stare renders me silent.

**CLYDE:** Linda had a husband once. He was a good man. Died young. She could never bring herself to go looking again and I… I never found who I was looking for. We’ve been by each other’s side for sixty years. Sixty years. I gotta be honest, even after all we’ve been through, everything you and I have seen, I never felt like I was in a new world until now.

**AS:** I don’t think I can’t let you do this Clyde.

**CLYDE:** I’m sorry Alice, but it’s not up to you.

Clyde breathes in the cool night air, exhaling through his nose.

**CLYDE:** I yelled at her to come back, when she ran off to rob that ice cream parlour. I kept calling out and calling out. I spent so much energy trying to get her to come back to me. After a while I realised she wasn’t coming back… that I’d have to follow her. I should’ve realised it earlier. That’s all I can do.... follow where she goes.

Clyde looks at me, almost apologetically.

**CLYDE:** Goodbye Alice.

He turns away from the convoy and wanders back down the road.

**AS:** Clyde.

He turns around one last time.

**AS:** Do you want company?

It takes roughly an hour for us to walk back to the junction. In the time we have, I’m treated to the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The warmest fragments of their life together, the moments that built them, the waves that rocked them and the places they once called home. I don’t think I’ll ever agree with what Clyde is doing, but the more he talks, the more I understand.

His stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.

The story ends just as we reach the junction

**AS:** I hope she's out there.

**CLYDE:** I hope so too. Thank you for coming with me, I know it’s late.

**AS:** No… it’s never a bad time to see a friend off.

Clyde smiles at me one last time before turning to face the road. He steps over the threshold, past the old wooden sign. In the silence of the night, I hear nothing but his soft footsteps and the quiet breeze, which after a few minutes carries the last of him into an open sky.

It’s a long walk back to the convoy. My mind is numb to fear as I make my way through the dark, the corn rustling in the wind beside me.

It’s been four days since I arrived at Rob Guthard’s house, sat down at his table, and listened to him speak about the new world he’d discovered. In that time, I’ve seen things I can’t hope to comprehend, sights that exist beyond the spectrum of our reality. Things I wouldn't have deemed possible.

For all I know there is a Wintery Bay, and Bonnie has already arrived at her house by the sea, standing at the door, waiting with quiet confidence for her brother’s arrival.

I may never know. But I do hope they find each other, wherever they may be.",Entertainment

GetMotivated,"[Text] Soon I will be gone forever, but that's okay as long as someone reads this","I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

I'm finally an author!!!","**tl;dr:** [**me write good book, pls read**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKV1KNB)

\~   \~   \~

Good morning!

I'm willing to bet that most of you won't remember my novel's origin prompt, though you might recognize me from stories such as [the one where a man must face four judges in the afterlife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/bj3c3e/wp_when_you_die_you_wait_in_purgatory_until_you/) After all, it was over four years ago!

This was the prompt, if you want to take a look and see how poorly I wrote back then ;)

>[”You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43mjo9/wp_you_possess_the_ability_of_persistent_lucid/)

It went from a terrible five part miniseries, to a Wattpad hopeful, to nothing as I lost motivation and drowned in work through the years, until finally I straightened myself out and rewrote the whole manuscript starting last year.

And now, somehow, here we are.

I'm both humbled and proud to present *Lost in a Dream*, a novel that actually adheres pretty closely to the prompt even after all of the rewriting and deep edits. Here is the blurb from the rear cover:

>**If dreaming is a drug, then I'm a junkie.**  
>  
>For most people, sleeping is an obstacle. Something to get out of the way, so they can get back to their life. For others, it's an escape to nothing; a blissful break from the wears of life.  
>  
>It's the opposite for me.  
>  
>I live so that I can dream. I trudge through work so that I can go home and close my eyes, awakening in the real world—one where dreams do come true. A place where I can fight a dragon instead of my ever-disappointed boss, where I’m a warrior instead of a glorified telemarketer. A place where I matter.  
>  
>Tigers instead of taxes. Monsters instead of men with too much power.  
>  
>Reality is just the word we came up with to accept a mundane life. A birthing place for grander ideas we so desperately wish could come true.  
>  
>I choose to live in a world where they do.

I’ll also share a few quick bits about the book:

*Lost in a Dream* is a lovechild of literary fiction and fantasy; it's likely considered portal fantasy, but leans more toward the literary side thematically.

* The cover art was done by Flor Figueroa over at Fiverr - look into her work if you want awesome minimalist cover art!
* The novel is a shred under 74,000 words, so it's not a book you can club people with. Sorry.
* It is a standalone novel--there won't be a sequel. I do, however, already have my next books planned.
* *Lost in a Dream* is my first published work!

Here's a snippet from the **advanced praise** for *Lost in a Dream:*

As of right now, there is no hardcover--I couldn't get it prepared in time for my desired launch date. If you would be interested in a hardcover, [please visit my subreddit launch post for more information + the mailing list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/resonatingfury/comments/ioak72/ot_i_did_it_i_finally_did_it_im_a_published_author/)

The e-book is $3.99, and the paperback is $12.99. Since these are eligible for Kindle Unlimited, it will likely display the book as 'free'; if you look below the header, you can see a ""Buy for 3.99"" option. That's how you buy the e-book if you're not interested in KU.

Of course, if you do use Kindle Unlimited, feel free to just read it there :)

If you read and enjoy the story, please consider leaving a review on Amazon, even a short one or just a rating! Those reviews can be the difference in coming months as people who aren't familiar with my shorter work decide whether or not to buy it; reviews are the foundation of an author's career, in a sense.

\~  \~  \~

&#x200B;

You are a world of your own.

That’s not to say you’re extraordinary, necessarily—you might be. Chances are you’re more so than me, at the least, but that’s not much of a feat. Rather, we are each little universes of thought, infinite in expanse yet bound by flesh; pioneers lost in our own minds. Every human is a wellspring of possibility and impossibility, every breath a wish for something greater as we run desperate from the impending dark.

We are, in a sense, prisoners to ourselves. Slaves to dreams we may well never grab hold of, working to the bone so that one day the schism between what we want and what we have might narrow ever so slightly. It is no surprise that every night we shut down for a brief reprieve, where we get a taste of the strange workings inside our heads. A glimpse into the potential we each have, raw as it may be.

When we aren’t asleep, exploring our own dreams, we look to those of others. Snippets of what it’s like to live in someone else’s mind; pretty portals to vast, new, and often beautiful worlds, or ones so terrible and forlorn that anything seems tolerable when compared. Something—anything—to distract from the one that we’re in. To feel greater than ourselves.

After all . . . isn’t that why you’re here?

# ~ ~ ~

*Is it greed to desire something grand?*

I often asked myself things like that as I killed someone.

Many lives have been forever reduced to similar questions that fade in and out like fireflies on a dark summer night—what’s ironic is that putting a sword through a neck is so much easier than finding the answers. It shouldn’t be, right? Just reach out and grab one of the little lightbugs and put it in a jar to study later . . . but every time I try, they vanish. All I get is a fistful of darkness.

By the time I was done thinking about all of that, there was only one other person breathing in the field before me: the man who had killed my family. My friends. My clansmen. I’d have cried looking at him if that well hadn’t dried up so long before; screamed if there were any leftover rage to burn.

""You're strong, Kinghunter,"" Ilhor Drago snarled, a hulking man in shimmering ebony armor patterned with wispy typhoons of cream and oxblood. He must’ve stood seven feet tall. ""But this is my home, and I'll not die here like some flame you'd snuff out with a shovel of dirt.""

He peered at me through two clusters of holes in a solid iron headpiece, describable only as a perforated bucket. The rest of his battalion littered the wood-lined meadow like smashed tin cans. They'd made quite a morbid medium for my art, shades of death tainting the lush, fertile forest around us, painting fern and flower slick with a contrasting crimson. In the holy glow of spring's sun, amidst a field paint-brushed with trampled fuchsia tulips and peonies that dribbled out of the treeline, the bloodied plants almost looked at home.

Ilhor charged at me, and I backpedaled toward the lake's muddy shore while keeping my sword raised overhead. Ilhor would be a challenge, no doubt—perhaps even worth three whole questions—but challenges are meant to be overcome, even if that challenge was once the most feared knight in any kingdom. A man known for cleaving children in two might terrify most, but I’d have fought God himself if that’s what it would’ve taken to put an end to Hadrian’s reign.

*What will I do when all of this is over?*

His footwork was perfectly placed with excellent tempo; he had the speed of a fox despite swelling with brutish strength, bowing the boundaries of human limits as if they physically couldn't contain his mass. Each swing of his enormous weapon left my own feeling heavier and heavier in hand, every metallic crack a seismic spasm that rang my soul like a church bell. I ducked and weaved through his razing, slowly backstepping to dodge; parrying had become too taxing on my aching palms. With each lurch forward, he churned huge piles of mud, flinging it around us. Though he was slowed, the length of his broadsword kept me from making a clean retreat.

*Is there a place left in the world for someone like me?*

Not only was I reduced to defense, but the stout cascade of steel he donned had virtually no openings, aside from under the armpits and a small gap beneath his helmet—one just big enough to slip a thin, thirsty blade into.

Another swing, another step, retreating further and further until I could avoid parrying no more and our swords locked with spark and screech. He grabbed me with a single hand that touched its fingers together at the nape of my neck, feet desperately reaching for the ground as he lifted me into the air. I must've looked to pedal myself airborne.

*Why am I so damn good at this?*

“Why did you come here?” Ilhor asked, though he didn’t care to relax his grip. “I defected. I defected!”

My words barely squeezed out between his fingers. “Hadrian wouldn’t let a defector live. Did you think an early retirement would save you?”

“How did you even find this place? He promised me it was safe!”

“Nowhere—” I punched at his giant gauntlets like a child, gasping. “—is safe.”

He grunted twice; once at me, and once at the ground.

With our weight combined, he sank past his ankles into the soft, dense mud that lined the lake's western shore. He dropped me, hoping it wasn’t too late, then yanked at them fruitlessly—an alligator has strength on the close, not open.

I lunged, but his sword slammed into mine and sent it flying further into the forest than reality should allow, nesting into the canopy with a grating *buzz* like a silver beetle. A pained screech and flurry of wings rang out, followed by a distant, wooden *thunk*. Before I could look back in disdain, his blade was thrusting straight at my heart. I ducked, twisting, and barely managed to get low enough for it to deflect off my mail, then grabbed his wrists and pushed forward with all my weight to outstretch his arms.

I only had a second before he'd overwhelm me, but that was all I needed. A small dagger, its polished gold hilt adorned with rubies, was partially hidden at his hip under a small flap of fraying linen. I let go of his off-hand, dropped even lower and grabbed it, then released his sword hand and pushed forward. In a blur of motion, I jammed the dagger into the thin gap between his helmet and breastplate just as his massive python of a left arm snapped at me again. A weary stumble backward was enough to escape his reach.

He struggled and sucked at the air, his words wet with blood. “I’m . . . not even . . . a king. . . .”

“How many innocent people did you kill for one?” I whispered, hacking off his head.

*That was for you, Ophelia. For our little ones.*

He plummeted into the coast, sinking into it a little bit. After a moment to collect myself, taking a few deep breaths, I was free to finally loot his body—a vulture hungry for the treasure I could smell on him. Out of a covered compartment at his right hip, I pulled out a golden scroll with reverence, cupping it in my hands and brushing my thumbs across its complex network of embossed vines. It was the fifth one I'd stolen, and it was every bit as mesmerizing as the first, glowing as though the sun itself had been laid out in my still aching palms. I knelt there for some time, drinking its glow, and aches melted to memory with each moment. Eventually, I found it within myself to forfeit worship and tuck it into a satchel at my waist.

My fugitive beetle-sword was stuck in a tree nearly twenty yards away, with traces of blood on and around it. Splintered branches and shredded leaves littered the area, but there were no signs of life—or death—anywhere. I yanked it out, apologized to anything I may have harmed in Dominaria Forest, and ran back to the lake's edge.

As I approached the castle, stepping over bodies like they were nothing more than fallen branches after a storm, a light, playful voice caught me off-guard.

""What a shame—I wanted to kill him.""

I spun, reflexively unsheathing my sword to flare wary steel. A woman emerged from behind bark, crossing her arms and leaning lazily against the tree she'd been using for cover. Her weapon was unattended, dangling with a laxness inherited from its owner.

""I was rooting for you to lose, but your fighting skills are impressive. You're not like the others I’ve run into around here,"" she continued, her gaze sharper than a blade fresh off of whetstone, her lips hinting at a smirk.

I smiled as a cool breeze slid through thick trees, relaxing. ""Yeah. You seem . . . different, somehow. You seem real.""",

WritingPrompts,[OT] 2 years ago I responded to a prompt about the Roman Empire surviving until 1999. Now it is a full length novel!!,"I am so excited about this!

Two years ago, I started writing short stories here on /r/WritingPrompts. And the fourth prompt that I ever responded to was: [The Roman Empire never collapsed and the year is 1999 AD](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2kx5e9/wp_the_roman_empire_never_collapsed_and_the_year/). I enjoyed writing it so much that I soon followed it up with a Part II. Then I just kept writing and writing until it turned into a 90,000 word novel: Rex Electi! [The book is available on Amazon here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N03B1AJ) and, if you have a different e-reader, there are PDF and ePub versions [available here](https://gumroad.com/l/htCH). It's $2.99 through both sites.

Here's the blurb:

> Caius Serica, a pilot in the Roman military in the year 1999, is whisked away from his camp in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances. He soon learns that every aspect of his life so far, including the staged deaths of his parents, has been arranged by the Senate Tribunal in an attempt to mold him into the perfect leader. Now there are only thirty candidates, including Caius, left competing to be the Emperor's heir. Success in a series of trials will reunite him with his family and make him the most powerful man in the world, but failure will lead to a life of isolation and imprisonment. As Caius enters the trials, it becomes apparent that the tests themselves are not the problem: it is the twenty nine other candidates willing to do whatever it takes to win, including maim or kill their top competitors. Can Caius navigate the pitfalls of imperial politics and cutthroat competition, all while performing well enough to succeed in the trials fair and square?

I'm also *thrilled* to have a physical copy of it! [Just look at how awesome this is!](http://imgur.com/a/wGUBX) I am so pleased to be able to have a copy to put up on my bookshelf (well, actually I am going to frame mine but you probably wouldn't do that). If you would also like a physical copy, you can [get a copy here through Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6709876)! Physical copies are $8.89, but well worth it!

I just want to thank everyone in the /r/WritingPrompts community. This is my first novel (I also have an ebook collection [available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/3jhk4n/i_published_an_ebook_its_called_prompt_me_you/) but that doesn't really count), and it just feels like I am finally taking a step that I have *always* wanted to take. Posting here has honestly changed my life, and I owe that to all of you readers. And more specifically, thank you to everyone who subscribes to /r/Luna_Lovewell for all of your support and encouragement. 

So that's all! I really hope you'll pick up a copy of the book and give it a read!

Now it's a finished novel!","Six months ago, I answered a prompt where superpowers are determined by birth location and the first person had just been born in space.  Now it's a finished novel!

Here is the original prompt from user /u/mdmarshmallow

**[Superpowers are based on the topography of where someone is born (IE: Mountains, deserts, etc.). The first person has just been born in space.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/65f88x/wp_everyone_has_a_superpower_based_on_the/)**

[Kindle copies available for only $2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK), which can be read on phone, computer, or tablets!  

**Here is chapter 1, which was the original response that spurred everything forwards**

It was an accident, of course.

My birth, my being in space, and well, I suppose I was an accident as well. An accident from the director of engineering screwing the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired; the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth. Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a mere maid much attention. After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars. I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well.

But there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid. For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall, she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform. As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness. As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different from anyone else.

Star Child, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young. Star Child, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life. Star Child, she reprimanded whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point.

“When will I go to school?” I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought-iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass.

“You already go to school, Star Child,” she said. “And your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.”

“Not *that* school,” I had said, pulling a face. “I want to go to the academy. The special school, for the others like me!” I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin.

“Star Child, listen and stop that at once,” she said, her eyes level with mine. “There *are* no others like you. Those children; they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be. And they can't know, do you understand me?”

“I guess,” I answered with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed. “But I don't like my school. Everyone there knows we can't be like them, that we can't be special.”

“Star Child, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too. But not now – if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy. They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.”

And as I grew older, I realized that she was right. That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door and classified her on the spot. That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm during which she had been born. Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.

So instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day, I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library. From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.

But distractions came easy to me.

As I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police. The academy became increasingly harder to attend, and the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note. Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report. It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look to see who had thrown it.

But I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Star Child.

Leslie felt tired. He assumed he was supposed to, since this was the way he (and everyone else in his class) had always felt. As he awaited his turn to be called to the front of the stadium—to be branded with a new job, new housing arrangement, possibly a new spouse and pet dog named Sophie—he wondered what his new life would look like. Would he grow old as a construction worker, perhaps? Or an office manager, whatever vague responsibilities that entailed? Maybe a simple cashier at a grocery store, because in spite of new technologies, people still had to eat, and robots were no good at helping the elderly pack their vehicles with groceries.

A quiet groan escaped him. He felt even more tired now. He entertained an unexpected thought: *Is this all my life is now? Is this all I can look forward to? A job?*

His name was called. Not his real name of Leslie Farringer Hill—a confluence of his father Leslie’s name as well as that of his great grandfather Farringer—but his Assigned Name of 2099356. Leslie climbed onto a stage in the middle of an arena, where a line of stoic elders grasped their wrists and stared at him with grim indifference. Leslie sat beside dozens of civilians like himself, who sat before the Automated Work Reassignment bot, waiting for their assignments.

Leslie placed his forehead against wide screen and allowed the machine to dig a thin needle into his cerebral cortex. The pain was minimal, surprisingly—like the pinch you get when you pierce your ears. When it was done, Leslie and his classmates left the stage, and the elders announced, “Next!”

No applause. No congratulations. Just “Next.”

Leslie’s grandfather said that Reassignment used to be exciting. People were given the option—key word, “option”—to change jobs if they were unhappy, medically disabled, or better suited to another field. A good many of them got to choose their own jobs—a foreign concept to Leslie’s class of 2118. But then, the option to “choose” meant that jobs were in abundance, which had not been the case in half a century.

When the first version of the Primary Automation Network—or PAN—was released, there was high demand for workers needing to maintain the program’s vast webbing of databases, neural connections and information flow. Then the tech got smarter, and work done by human hands became outdated; PAN began functioning on its own, running its own updates and anticipating its own needs.

The human population, however, continued to rise, while jobs declined. Nowadays, you got what you got. You didn’t argue or complain. If you did, you’d starve—and they’d let you.

“Hey, Les, what’d they stick you with?” Travis Dollman asked. Leslie noticed the shifting of his eyes back and forth as he gazed into his Internal Personalized Interface, which accessed the ever-growing layers of PAN.

“Don’t know yet,” Leslie replied. He wasn’t in a hurry to find out, either; he would have to live with his fate for the rest of his life. “How about you?”

“Reading the job description right now,” Travis said. He sounded distant, lost in the world of PAN. “Looks like… Oh, hey! Not bad! Chief Agriculture Overseer for the… Ah, shit, in the Swamps. Oh well, it’s good pay. Wife Meredith, Doberman Pixie, son named Liam. And triple supply of rations on a private acre. Not bad.”

Travis blinked, tuning out of his IPI. “Aren’t you gonna look at yours?”

Leslie shrugged. “Later. I’m tired. Had to do a double-shift last night, didn’t sleep much. I think I’ll go crash at the apartment.”

“Well, at least look and see if you still *have* an apartment first.” He grinned slyly, like he was telling a good joke that Leslie would never get. “Who knows? Maybe you landed a gig with Infinitum. They get crazy-good benefits.”

Leslie returned a shy smile. “Doubt it, but… Maybe you’re right.”

Leslie pulled up his IPI and dove into PAN’s universe. His system calibrated updates in seconds, a nice blinking clock telling him that it was 59 percent complete… 73 percent… 95 percent…

When it finished, a welcome letter greeted him. It read:

Congratulations on your Reassignment, 2099356! You have been reassigned to occupation:

SERIAL KILLER

That didn’t sound right. It sounded like… well, not anything that Leslie had heard of, actually. The only thing familiar to him was the word “kill,” which was spoken when something electronic sparked in his office and the Electrical Technicians had to “kill” the connection. He supposed it could also pertain to when the elderly had reached their time of Passage, when they grew too old to perform their jobs appropriately and were euthanized; it was sometimes morbidly referred to as the “time of killing,” a phrase Leslie and the general population repulsed.

But “serial killer” was something new to him. Below his title, an icon of a file folder blinked deep red at him, indicating the position was high level and top secret. Which meant upper echelon access into the depths of PAN, which very few civilians knew about, let alone explored.

Below that was a list of his benefits package: Fully-furnished housing on a five-acre plot (an ungodly amount of living space in today’s economy), wife Blaise Parkham, a gray Persian named Mufasa, and five times the normal ration supply delivered weekly to his doorstep.

*Holy shit,* Leslie thought. He blinked and closed his IPI.

“Well?” Travis asked impatiently.

“Uh… Something in agriculture, too.”

Travis squinted at him. *“Something in agriculture?* What the hell does that mean?”

“Yeah, I dunno. It’s a lot to read and I’m too tired. I’ll, uh… talk to you about it later. Need to rest.”

Leslie nearly ran out of the building. He felt Travis’s suspicious gaze on him, but he brushed it off. He felt uneasy, his adrenaline pumping faster than he was used to. If he was going to live in high-class, he needed to figure out what his job entailed, and he couldn’t concentrate with Travis’s never-ending monologue in his ear.

Leslie walked down the street, passing beneath the mousetraps of tram cars that ran noisily all day and night. Directly outside of Town Hall, a line of Individually Automated Vehicles awaited their passengers. He’d never had a car—had only set foot in one once, in fact. He had always relied on his feet for transportation. The 120-degree heat and omnipresent cloud of smoke lingering in the air had ceased to bother him.

About halfway home, a sleek charcoal vehicle stopped beside him. A door popped open and a charming female voice spoke: “Passenger 2099356, you may now enter your vehicle.”

*Mine? No way. Not mine.*

A few seconds later, the voice beckoned him again: “Passenger 2099356, please enter your vehicle and select your destination.”

Leslie warily stepped into the car. On the dashboard was a map of Ponderosa Pines, with a blue circle in the top left corner that read, “Home.” Leslie selected it, and 45 minutes later arrived at a large residence on Old Bakery Avenue. It was surrounded by a stone fence. The car approached a broad metal gate. The gate’s sensor connected to the car’s dashboard and asked for Leslie’s fingerprints. Leslie placed a hand on the screen, his identity was verified, and the gate opened.

Inside the fence, pine trees rose to staggering heights, dropping streams of needles and cones as the wind tossed them about. Beyond the trees was a stone mansion, painted white with black highlights around the windows and door frames. Two cars were parked out front—one for him and one for Blaise, he presumed.

He exited the car and entered into a wide-open living room, freshly painted and sparsely furnished. A chandelier hung above a staircase that led to the second and third floors.

In the far room at the other end of the house, a 90-inch television blasted music videos. Leslie could see the back of a woman’s black-haired head.

“2099356, I presume?” the black-haired head asked without turning around.

“Call me Leslie.”

“Call me Blaise. Or 2105344, I don’t give a shit.”

Lovely.

Leslie climbed the stairs and found a bedroom with a double-king bed, which he presumed he was supposed to share with Blaise. Upon it, a royal gray Persian named Mufasa yawned at him, his red collar jingling as the cat shook his head.

Leslie climbed into bed and refreshed his IPI. The number of databases he could access in PAN as a Mini Mart clerk—his first job—numbered in the low 100s. As a serial killer, they numbered at 989, 341, 863—and the numbers rose every few milliseconds.

Leslie frantically searched for anything related to “serial killer,” and began queuing thousands of historical documents and videos and biographical entries to download simultaneously. An alert rose on his IPI stating that his downloading power was insufficient for such high-speed traffic—would he like to upgrade to the latest version 13.4.57?

*Latest version?* he thought. *I never imagined upgrading to anything higher than a 3.0.1, let alone the* latest version *of IPI software.*

He agreed to the Terms of Use and—without suffering penalties to his weekly rations, to his surprise—the latest update of IPI was downloaded.

And with it, seconds later, gigabytes of information about serial killers from the infinite PAN.

Gigabytes of blood, torture, dismemberment and murder. Videos that immortalized the terror of the victims as well as the ecstasy on the faces of the voyeurs who slayed them.

Gigabytes of autopsy reports from the 21st century detailing the gunshot wounds, burns, incisions, and dismemberments of millions of victims—and the biographical recounting of the sadistic rituals the preceded them.

Gigabytes of accounts detailing how to stalk a victim before the kill; how to kill and dispose of a body; the best tools to make it quick, or make it slow…

Leslie’s vision turned white as the information was pummeled into his IPI. He blinked hard to log out of it. Then he turned over the side of his bed and vomited all over the hardwood floor. He vomited four more times until his body ached and vibrated.

His IPI popped up unexpectedly—which shouldn’t have happened. There were built-in codes which disallowed the software to act without permission from the host. But, Leslie thought, maybe it was just a feature that came with the high-profile job. A new message alerted him:

Greetings, 2099356! Your first assignment is:

LYLE MCCATHERN

Location:

1573 E. FAUBREY LANE

Time to Complete:

26 HOURS

*Shit, what does that mean?* Leslie thought.

“What do you think it means, numb nuts?” he argued aloud with himself. “It means you have to kill him.”

“Kill what?” Blaise asked, standing in the doorway. Leslie startled at her appearance.

“Oh my *god,*” Blaise exclaimed, noticing the pile of vomit. “Are you sick?”

Leslie hurriedly covered the vomit with the bedsheets. “Uh, no… Don’t worry about it. I’ll clean it up.”

“You said you need to kill something,” Blaise said. “Is there an electrical problem? Do we need an Electrical Technician, or something?”

“No, no. I’ll handle that, too, don’t worry.”

An awkward silence hung in the air. Then, another message appeared in the IPI:

Instrument of Choice:

HATCHET

Leslie’s heart plummeted into his guts. He nearly puked a seventh time. He choked it back, swallowing painfully.

Blaise sat on the other side of the bed. “So… I guess we’re married now. You wanna… I dunno, go on a date, or something?”

LYLE MCCATHERN. 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE. 26 HOURS. HATCHET.

*Jesus Christ.*

“Did you hear me?” Blaise demanded.

“Yeah, a date. Sure. Tomorrow. I have some work to do.”

Blaise scoffed. “Already? Jeez, you just started, like, an hour ago.”

Leslie nodded uncertainly. “Lots to do, I guess.”

\*\*\*

His first kill was awful. And messy—*really* messy. Why a hatchet was chosen for him, he didn’t know. But he sensed that, somewhere beyond the IPI, PAN itself was watching him. He’d been in the workforce long enough to realize that if you didn’t fulfill your job requirements— all T’s crossed and I’s dotted—you wouldn’t be granted leeway or forgiveness. Your rations, valuable as they were, would be first to suffer.

After that, shit would keep rolling downhill.

Leslie accessed his PAN downloads on disposing a body and then how to extract evidence from a crime scene. He had to vomit multiple times into the garbage bags he used to mop up Lyle McCathern’s remains. He finished at the 23-hour mark, and PAN was satisfied.

A new message appeared, with an icon of a cake with flaming candles beneath it:

Congratulations on completing your first assignment, 2099356!

Next assignment to be uploaded in:

56.6334 HOURS

As the slaughtered remains of Lyle McCathern—just some Joe Schmo who worked at a brewery, it seemed—incinerated in a pit beside him, Leslie cupped his hands over his face and sobbed.

He sobbed. And retched. And sobbed some more.

Then he went home and stayed in bed until his next assignment.

\*\*\*

He went on dates with Blaise. They exchanged half-hearted conversation. He stroked the fur along Mufasa’s spine, making the cat purr contentedly. He sat in front of the television with his new family and watched movies to which he couldn’t pay attention.

Because the information lurking in his mind was as alluring as it was insidious. Leslie didn’t appreciate the allure, but he acknowledged it was there. He found himself accessing crevices of PAN that housed information he would have never considered. Some of the terms he came across—murder, crime, torture—had been deleted from public access decades after PAN was invented, Leslie discovered. With centralized control of PAN solely in the hands of one corporation, Infinitum, coupled with the mandatory law that IPI’s be implanted at birth, it was easy for them to conceal and reveal whatever information they wanted.

And now Leslie had unrestricted access to it.

At the 56.6334-hour mark, Leslie received a new message on his IPI. He uttered a worried half-groan before the software consumed him:

Good afternoon, 2099356!

Your next assignment is:

JAMES AND JILL HAWTHORNE

Location:

MILDRED’S COFFEE HOUSE

Instrument of Choice:

GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED

Time to Complete:

2 HOURS

Leslie searched for Mildred’s Coffee House on his IPI map. It was nearly an hour away by car. And he had no idea where he would have the time to find a Glock 43, whatever that was, and kill two people—*two* of them. In a public place.

“Fuck,” he whispered.

“What’s wrong?” Blaise asked, not looking away from the television.

“Work again.”

“Do you know when you’ll be back?”

Leslie sighed. “Soon, probably.”

The car door opened automatically for him. It received notifications when Leslie received missions. It sped down the highway at top speed, as if it understood his time constraints.

Then, a hidden compartment opened beside the map screen. Leslie reached in and extracted a couple of things. First, a handgun—the Glock 43 with a silencer, he guessed. He’d never held a gun before, so he sifted through dozens of links on gun handling before reaching the coffee shop.

The other items included a denim jacket, a fake goatee, sunglasses, and a baseball cap representing a team he didn’t recognize.

*PAN is teaching me how to be a serial killer,* Leslie thought. He applied the accessories. He was grateful for the gesture, but didn’t expect PAN’s courtesy to last long; the automaton had never done him favors like this before. No sense in expecting the generosity to guide him through the rest of his life.

Mildred’s was packed with people. Leslie had no idea coffee was such a hot commodity at one o’ clock in the afternoon. The line dumped out of the front door and onto the surrounding sidewalk. Leslie took his place in line behind a fat couple and a yipey Yorkie with which they rubbed noses. *“You’re such a good boy,”* they coddled. *“Oh, what a good, good boy.”*

Leslie scanned through PAN to find out what James and Jill Hawthorne looked like: He, a pretty-boy millionaire-looking barbie in real estate with slick gray hair and an attractive layer of stubble; she, also a slick-haired real estate agent enticing enough to be in modeling or porn—whichever PAN deemed most productive, Leslie scoffed.

Music blasted inside. People between the ages of 25 and 35 dominated the dining hall. Leslie glanced around, and spotted the couple in the corner. They looked sulky, certainly the least lively of the crowd, as if they’d just had a fight.

Jesus, there were a lot of people. How could PAN expect Leslie to fulfill his job with three dozen witnesses surrounding him? He felt sweat seep from every pore on his body. His IPI announced that he had 35 minutes and 14 seconds remaining… 13 seconds… 12…

“Fuck,” he mumbled. *“Fuck.”*

In a panic, he nearly retreated to his IPI for guidance.

But then it hit him. That word: Panic.

“How can I help you?” a bored, acne-infested barista inquired.

“Um… Three black coffees, please,” Leslie replied. He paid for the drinks, then carried them over to a low table surrounded by beanbags on which the still-sulking Hawthorne couple resided.

Leslie took a deep breath. *Here goes.*

“Hey, friends!” his voice boomed. They looked at him with suspicion and confusion.

“Remember me? It’s Marty! Your old pal!”

Jill looked at James, and he returned her concerned glare. “I don’t—” Jill began to say.

Leslie interrupted her. “Come on, you remember me! From college! We took the same algebra class!”

“I didn’t—”

Leslie cut her off again. “Here. Black coffee, just the way you like it. On the house. Come on, let’s get a picture together, what do you say?”

Impatiently, he gestured for them to merge together on one chair. “Come on, squeeze together, don’t be shy. You’re married, for crying out loud! You’ve seen each other *naked!”*

The Hawthornes laughed nervously. Leslie felt as nervous as they sounded.

He retrieved a phone from his pocket and loaded the camera app. “Alright, now, smile and say cheese!”

They did. Just before Leslie dialed the “Take Photo” button, he uncovered the Glock from behind his denim jacket. Jill Hawthorne noticed it. Leslie pulled the trigger twice—a quick “one, two.” Jill’s surprise turned to terror, then to realization that she’d been shot and was seconds from death. James died without knowing he’d been shot.

The camera snapped a picture.

Leslie stuffed the gun back in his coat and sprang to his feet. *“HO!”* he screamed, waving his limbs wildly. *“Holy SHIT! Sweet mother of CHRIST! SOMEBODY HELP!”*

Curious eyes moved to the dead bodies.

Then: Panic.

Beautiful.

Leslie allowed himself to be swallowed by the frantic herd as people stormed to the front door and created a bottleneck. He was nearly crushed by the fat couple with their hideous Yorkie as they struggled to push through the doorway. Finally, he separated from the crowd and sprinted to his car. He selected “Destination: Home.” It took him nearly fifteen minutes to catch his breath, and another ten to slow his heart rate. He followed the procedures on shirking the evidence, then returned home.

“You’re right,” Blaise said, still sitting in the same place on the couch as when Leslie had left. “That was quick.”

“Yeah,” Leslie said, feeling breathless. “Easy day.”

He retreated to the king bed, where he expected once again to vomit and sob. But he didn’t. In fact, he felt… good. Really good, actually. His IPI congratulated him once again, this time promising to deliver a tray of expensive cakes and sweets to his door within 24 hours.

Cakes aside, he felt lifted, as if the adrenaline boost had filled him with helium. He liked this airy feeling.

And something else: He didn’t feel remorse, as he had after bludgeoning Lyle McCathern. The bullets were quick and not nearly as messy as the damned hatchet. He could get used to bullets. It felt less personal. More like a job.

And that’s exactly what it was.

\*\*\*

Leslie killed half a dozen more people in the subsequent month. A sleezy waitress in Nevada; a hokey bartender running for mayor in California; two airline attendants from an Asian country he didn’t recognize (just some dull, primitive society that had outlawed PAN, as Leslie understood it).

His murders became famous on the news, though the media gave him the piss-poor, unimaginative name of the Ponderosa Pines Executioner. With millions of databases he could download in seconds, Leslie learned from the mistakes of the idiots of the past centuries. No evidence had been found to incriminate him. Fortunately for him, the criminal justice system had been gutted to the point of near obsolescence in the last 100 years. Thanks to the strong-armed, omniscient PAN, people knew what stepping out of the parameters set forth by PAN meant. They knew that a crime against PAN, no matter how small, would risk their lives.

What they didn’t know—but Leslie now did—was that a crime against PAN meant a violent, prolonged, agonizing death. PAN ensured that jobs of such a specialty were still around—and well-compensated.

Not only had Leslie gotten better at killing—when he wasn’t actually doing it, he was shuffling through thousands of digital archives learning about it—but he thought he’d gotten better about *not caring* about it. That is, until he had to kill two teenage parents of a four-year-old.

Leslie hadn’t noticed the kid standing in the hallway, watching as Leslie duct-taped his parents’ mouths shut, strapped them to chairs and started drilling holes in them (the instrument of choice was an electric drill). He hadn’t noticed the kid until he’d burrowed a drill bit deep into his mother’s skull and killed her.

“Ah, shit,” Leslie muttered.

The kid had just stood there, sucking his thumb, taking it all in. They stood in silence for a full minute. Then, Leslie left the kid alone in the house, got in the car, and went back home. Realizing the magnitude of what he’d done, he vomited for the first time since Lyle McCathern.

“Goddamn it,” he grumbled. He repeated it louder. *“Goddamn it.”*

He punched the dashboard. Then he did it again, and again, wailing on the thing. He started slamming his elbows and knees and feet around the car’s interior, screaming and cursing. He threw himself about until it hurt, and continued until he felt like one giant, throbbing ache.

Weakly, he picked up his phone to dial the police. A picture of the Hawthornes’ dead bodies, taken just seconds after Leslie shot them, flashed on the screen. Leslie’s lips trembled, and he broke out into hysterical sobbing. He threw his phone aside. He’d forgotten about that picture. His first instinct was to smash the damned thing, destroy all traces of evidence.

But Leslie couldn’t just ignore the kid. He’d already left him alone in that house, amidst the grotesque corpses of his parents. He’d hate himself forever if he just left the kid like that. He needed to call someone to that house to get the boy.

One of the things Leslie had repeatedly stumbled upon in the PAN archives was the remorselessness that seemed to be inherent in the most famous killers. Most of them felt no pity for the victims or their families, no regrets for their actions. In fact, a lot of them claimed they would do it again if they ever got out. They didn’t have to think about how *not* to feel bad.

Leslie wasn’t that lucky.

He dialed the police number and reported a break-in. Then he hung up the phone, and forgot about smashing it. He felt tired, more so than he’d felt at Reassignment last month. How he longed for a chance to change jobs, like his grandfather Farringer had done before him.

“I can’t keep doing this,” Leslie spoke out loud. “I’m not… I’m not a serial killer.”

He knew PAN could hear him, even when he wasn’t logged in to the IPI. Leslie expected the IPI to activate any moment to deliver a personal message from PAN saying Leslie was out of line. A reminder that “breach of a worker’s protocol with daily job-related task ensures penalties commensurate with the worker’s offense, with punishments to be fulfilled in accordance with PAN Law 00841.”

Yeah, Leslie had known it by heart since his early childhood school days. It meant that whole violent, prolonged, agonizing death thing.

But no message came. Surely PAN had heard him, but it didn’t have anything to say.

Leslie rolled over to cry some more.

\*\*\*

Leslie threw his phone down on the king bed. It landed next to Mufasa, who sniffed it considerately, then flinched away with disgust. Leslie barged into his bathroom and slammed the door shut. He felt overheated and sweaty. He turned the shower faucet to cold. He didn’t bother to remove his clothes. He stood beneath the water until cold tremors shook his body.

There was a knock at the bathroom door. “Are you okay?” Blaise shouted.

Leslie didn’t answer right away. Blaise asked him twice more, her tone of voice becoming more afraid each time.

“Fine,” Leslie mumbled. “I’m fine.”

A message arrived in his IPI:

Greetings, 2099356!

Your next assignment is:

BLAISE PARKHAM

Location:

1066 OLD BAKERY AVENUE

Instrument of Choice:

GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED

Time to Complete:

3.43 MINUTES

No. No, something was wrong. A bug, a glitch. Something. It wasn’t right.

“What the *fuck?”* Blaise’s scream sent shivers along Leslie’s spine, as strong as the cold water shivers he felt now.

Leslie shut off the water and dashed out of the bathroom, water cascading off his sopping clothes. In the bedroom, Blaise stared incredulously into Leslie’s phone.

“What the fuck *is* this?”

She held out the phone, which brandished the image of the dead Hawthornes. Leslie’s heart pounded wildly, then sank into his bowels.

“Why were you looking through my phone?” he asked. His voice was steady in spite of his shivering.

Blaise snorted. “Really? That’s what you’re going to say? Tell me what the fuck this picture is doing on your fucking phone, Les.”

“I can’t.”

A bitter smile drew across Blaise’s lips. She shook her head slowly. “These pictures were on the news. Are you the Executioner?”

Leslie’s silence and downward gaze told Blaise all she needed to know.

“Jesus Christ…” she said.

The timer in Leslie’s IPI dipped below two minutes. The numbers pulsed in blood-red, in sync with his own heartbeat. PAN began listing the consequences of Leslie’s failure to complete the assignment.

Leslie held up his hands, both empty, for Blaise to see. “I’m going to get a towel. When I come out, let’s talk.”

He retreated into the bathroom. He picked up his gun. He returned to the bedroom and pointed the muzzle at Blaise’s chest.

Her eyes widened. “You can’t be serious.”

Leslie’s IPI counted down the seconds: 52… 51… 50…

“It’s your job now, isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “The Pines Executioner thing. It’s why our rations are so high. Why you keep disappearing, sometimes for days.”

40… 39… 38…

Leslie thought of the kid standing in the hallway, and Leslie standing beside the dead parents. It occurred to him that PAN knew everything, including what Leslie was doing right at that moment. It knew every detail about every killer before him. And it was adding Leslie, the first serial killer in 100 years, to its database. Leslie Farringer Hill, the Pines Executioner. He slaughtered a family and ruined a kid’s life… because he was Reassigned.

“No,” he whimpered, a line of tears running past his nose. He shook his head angrily. “*No.”*

19… 18… 17…

Leslie hurtled the gun against a far wall. “Get out of here,” he commanded.

Blaise didn’t hesitate. She dropped the phone and sprinted for the door, leaving Leslie as alone as he’d left the little boy.

The timer expired. The IPI deemed the assignment a failure. It commanded Leslie to stay in his place of residency, reminded him penalties would be issued in accordance with PAN Law 00841… So on and so forth.

Leslie stripped out of his clothes, lay naked on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. It was the last time he would set foot in a house like this.

He stroked Mufasa’s cheeks and chin, enjoying the hum of the cat’s purr.

\*\*\*

Days later, once the Law Enforcement Branch had caught up with PAN’s report on Leslie’s failure to provide adequate work output, they came for him. They broke into Leslie’s bedroom, stuffed his head in a black bag, and shoved his naked body into a car he couldn’t see.

He spent two weeks in a cold dungeon. The walls echoed with each breath he took—as well as every beating, stabbing, and burning his hoarse voice protested.

A week into the torture, a voice spoke to him. A woman’s voice, though it sounded deep like a man’s.

“What do you know about the Rebellion?” the voice asked.

“The what?”

A fist collided with Leslie’s solar plexus, knocking the air out of his lungs.

“Tell me what you know about the Rebellion,” the voice said.

Leslie struggled to catch his breath. “I don’t… I don’t know…”

“Search him to make sure,” the voice instructed.

The hands that had winded him grasped his head and held it still. A high-pitched whirring sound drew close to his head.

Then a sharp stabbing pain electrified every nerve in Leslie’s body as a thin metal wire was inserted into his cerebral cortex. Leslie screamed, but couldn’t tell if the high pitch was from the wire or his voice.

The pain lasted a long time. How long, Leslie couldn’t know; there was no sunlight to guide his sense of time in the dungeon. Eventually, it stopped, and Leslie was allowed a brief break.

“Anything?” the woman’s voice demanded.

A low, grunting man spoke. “Nothing.”

“How thorough was your search?”

Hesitation in the man’s voice. “Pretty thorough.”

“‘Pretty thorough’ does not mean thorough. Do it again.”

The whirring sound. The blinding pain.

And more screaming.

\*\*\*

The sessions went on for days. Leslie’s nerves throbbed and he could barely move.

The door to his dungeon squeaked open. Footsteps approached his quivering body. He tried to speak—“no, please, no more”—but his voice was too hoarse, his lungs too tired, his body too shaky.

“Come with me, Mr. Hill.” Leslie recognized the deep-toned woman’s voice.

Leslie didn’t move.

The woman sighed. “Get him up.”

Strong, rough hands lifted Leslie by the armpits and dragged him into a bright hallway. The light pierced his eyes and brain. He scrunched his eyes closed, providing mild relief.

Minutes later, when he could open his eyes, Leslie saw he was being led into a large courtroom. He sat before a panel of disinterested elderly people in black robes. Their table was raised several feet higher than Leslie’s chair.

A gaunt-faced woman with blonde hair sat in the center of the panel, peering down at Leslie’s naked figure. “State your name for the record.” Her voice was sharp.

Leslie tried to speak, but his throat burned. He swallowed a few times to soothe the sandpaper feeling, but still only managed to grunt a few painful syllables.

The woman rolled her eyes. “Your name, please.”

Between hacking coughs, Leslie managed: “L-Leslie… F-Farr-ring-ger… H-H-Hill.”

“Mr. Hill, you have been charged by the High Court of Infinitum and Our Majesty the Primary Automation Network with failure to produce adequate service to the Union as part of your daily job duties. The proper punishment for such an offense, in accordance with PAN Law, is death.”

Leslie didn’t respond. This wasn’t news to him. He’d expected to die days ago. He was baffled that he was still alive.

“However,” the blonde woman continued, “upon reviewing the information extracted from your IPI, it appears you are the victim of a glitch in PAN’s system. The glitch was detected just hours ago, and is believed to have been caused by a virus implanted by a faction group known as the Rebellion.”

Leslie shook his head. “I… I’ve never heard—”

“I know you’ve never heard of them, Mr. Hill,” the woman interrupted impatiently. “That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Your Reassignment to the position of ‘serial killer’—a position that is not a true occupation, but a primitive criminal activity banned by PAN law—is something the Rebellion fabricated within PAN’s framework. The virus corrupted parts of PAN’s processing centers, and you were unlucky enough to be at the receiving end of this treachery during the Automated Work Reassignment. Due to your unwitting compliance in an act of treason against the Union, through no fault or knowledge of your own, you have been exonerated of all charges regarding your work performance failure.”

Leslie breathed deeply. “So… I can live.”

“Correct, Mr. Hill. However, after discovering your hidden identity as the Ponderosa Pines Executioner and your role in the forceful removal of nine workers of the Union, you will incur penalties commensurate with those listed in accordance with PAN Law 09663, as repayment for their sudden loss in productivity.”

“But I get to live.”

The woman rolled her eyes again and ignored him. “You will be Reassigned in the main lobby of this building before leaving. You will then be escorted to your new place of residency, where you will be allowed one day of rest and healing. Beginning Monday morning, you will report for work as specified in your occupational handbook.”

A large book was thrust into Leslie’s arms. He was given clean clothes and a ride to his new 12-by-12 apartment. And, of course, he received a new job.

He spent hours reading the manual on how to perform his duties as an Agricultural Secretary.

Eventually, he fell asleep and dreamed about nothing.

\*\*\*

Life went on. Leslie went to work on Monday and discovered that he was Agricultural Secretary to Travis Dollman, and so realized his fate was to not only file papers and answer phone calls but to endure the endless monologue of his new boss.

New stories of the “PAN glitches” began to pop up in the news regularly. Leslie wasn’t the only one Reassigned to a fake job. Apparently terrorism, gun smuggling, and rioting were circulating as legitimate occupations in the Work Reassignment Centers, and authorities at Infinitum hadn’t figured out how to counteract the damage that had been done.

Leslie took a huge cut in his ration supply: 0.25 times the average distribution (down from five times the normal amount in his previous “occupation”), to be carried out for the rest of his life. That was okay. Leslie could learn to live with less food and electricity.

A month into his job as Agricultural Secretary, Leslie’s bruises and lacerations had healed. He had a half-dozen scars where the probe had been inserted into his brain. He thought about his previous Reassignment every day, and the chaos and trauma it caused him and others.

He leaned against a rounded metal fence at the side of a river that crept between two cities. He felt a hand touch his spine. He spun around and saw the face of Blaise Parkham.

“Hey, you,” she said sadly.

He nodded politely. “Hello.”

“You made it out in one piece.” She rubbed a finger over his scars. “Well, not quite, I suppose.”

“Is there something I can do for you?”

“No. I just wanted to thank you for what you did.”

Leslie’s eyebrows furrowed. “For what I… did?”

She handed him a flyer, black and white with intricate geometric patterns in the corners. In the center, it read:

RAISE YOUR FISTS

FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

DOWN WITH THE GOD MACHINE

JOIN THE REBELLION

Leslie glanced from the flyer back to Blaise. “That was you? Everything I did… was because of you?”

She shrugged. “Not me personally. But yeah. My people.”

Leslie balled up the flyer in one hand. He felt angry enough to rip the metal fence from the ground.

“You used me as a tool. For what? This?” He shook the balled-up flyer in his hand. “The Rebellion?”

“For a chance to live a free life.”

“A free life?” Leslie shrieked. “Why in God’s name would you want that, if this is what we have to go through? We have work, housing, a steady supply of rations. Why do you care so much about your stupid cause that you’re willing to fuck everybody else to get it?”

Blaise pursed her lips. “Because Infinitum is pumping out killers, too. Not serial killers, but silent ones. They go into the houses of Rebellion members and black bag them. We don’t ever see them again. Those people you killed? We assigned you to do it because they were killing us.”

“Really? A brewery worker, a couple of real estate agents, a waitress? Two parents with a four-year-old child? These are the evil Rebellion killers?”

She nodded, ignoring the sarcasm. “Yes, they were. And they are just a microcosm of a massive, suppressed regime sanctioned by PAN itself.”

Leslie shook his head. He couldn’t believe it.

As if reading his thoughts, Blaise said, “You don’t have to believe me. But it’s true. Have a look for yourself.”

She offered him a tiny cardboard box large enough to house a wedding ring. Inside was a small chip with long, thin needles attached to it.

“I know your access to PAN is limited again. This will give you full access to all of its databases for 12 hours. After that, it fries. It’s not traceable, the encryption guarantees that. Just… take a look and see for yourself that I’m telling the truth.”

Leslie pocketed the device. “I’ll think about it,” he muttered bitterly.

“I’m sorry we used you,” Blaise said. “I’m not proud of it. But my convictions haven’t changed. I know why it had to be done. We had to send PAN and Infinitum a message. If I had to do it again, I would.”

“You would let me kill a boy’s parents in front of him again? For what? A chance at chipping away fragments of the so-called God Machine?”

She shook her head. “Not so you could kill a child’s parents, no. But for a chance to give that child a free world again, and his children after him? Yes, I would.”

They were silent for a long time. They stared at the horizon, the unwavering buildings set atop the restless water below. “PAN and Infinitum don’t care about us, Les,” Blaise continued. “They don’t care about anything but productivity, output, results. As long as they get that, the ends justify the means. They don’t care that we’re human beings, that we need more than just a stupid job. We need a purpose. And we need the room to find out for ourselves what that means.”

Leslie clenched his teeth, unwilling to release his bitterness. “I have a purpose. I’m an Agricultural Secretary. That’s what I do.”

Blaise stuffed her hands in her pockets and gave Leslie a light, sympathetic kiss on his cheek.

“Let me know if you change your mind.”

She left Leslie alone by the lake.

Leslie retrieved the tiny device from his pocket. He weighed the device and the crumpled flyer in his hands. He unfolded the flyer, smoothed out the wrinkles and read it again.

When he got home, he laid in bed for a long time, staring up at the ceiling. He unwrapped the tiny device and considered it.

He logged into his IPI. Then he lifted the chip to his forehead, and dug the needles into his scars.

Like the title says, about ten months ago, I found myself responding to this prompt one night:

> [**[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/)

Then, after serializing it on my subreddit and turning it into a story larger than I ever thought possible, I arrived at the decision about whether to make it a book. For a lot of writers, publishing a book is *the dream*, and in all honesty, I didn’t think I would ever actually do it. But now, after a lot of procrastination, a lot of late nights, a lot of learning, and a ton of editing, it’s here.

The entire series, named By The Sword, is a high fantasy trilogy of books with paranormal/supernatural elements, of which I’m publishing the first right now which comes in just shy of 100k words long. The book’s cover art was done by the fantastic /u/IsmaelGil, and I’m extremely happy with [how it turned out!](https://i.imgur.com/JIY228X.jpg)

As the title of this post says, that book is entitled Blood and Steel. You can read its synopsis right here:

> Death is a fickle thing.

> For most, it’s a force of nature, but Agil Novan sees the reaper in a different light. As the greatest swordsman of all time, he cherishes life, and he’s lived one full of both struggle and success. After all of his accomplishments, he too must face the reaper and its scythe.

> When challenged, however, the swordsman is not one to go without a fight. After parrying it once and impressing the reaper with a show of the blade, he is offered something more. A second chance at life—one that he is all but forced to accept.

> Now, stranded in an unfamiliar land with an unfamiliar body and far too many questions, Agil has his life threatened at every turn. Still, he is determined to survive. He knows what the reaper did to him. 

> And he has never been one to let vengeance go unfulfilled.

Also, as with how this first book was written, By The Sword is still a serialized story that I post chapter-by-chapter on multiple platforms including my subreddit, /r/Palmerranian. At the moment, I’m almost at the end of the second book in the serialization process. So if you would like to continue reading there, you can find the [story index here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palmerranian/comments/ar6zgy/by_the_sword_homepage/).

Now, without any further ado, I’ll leave you with the first chapter of Blood and Steel!

Live by the sword, die by the sword. That was the way I lived for so long.

It was an old adage—ancient even, depending on the version being told, but it was a useful one for someone like me. 

I was first told it by my father during the final years of his life. It came only a few short months after I started training, in fact. A few short months of becoming fascinated by the art of sword-fighting and spending every waking minute trying to master it.

My father was proud of me for my effort. He always gave me the largest smile when I explained this stance or that, detailing my dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman of them all. Of becoming a Knight of Credon and protecting our kingdom more effectively than any before me. He entertained my teenage ramblings without complaint. And since he’d been a swordsman himself during his formative years, he made sure to pass off that ancient wisdom before it became too late.

It was the last gift he ever gave me.

If only I’d known how true it was.

That mantra repeated in my head now as I stared across my path. Standing out there in my field, only a few dozen paces away from me, the reaper stared right back. Wind billowed through its tattered black cloak. It made no effort to conceal the bleached bone underneath. All it did was balance its scythe in skeletal fingers as though taunting me to come and fight.

I wondered why it didn’t simply attack me for my ignorance, why it didn’t finish the job after I had ignored all of the signs. A tense pain in my chest and a sudden shortness of breath were the only warnings I’d gotten during my morning walk. But before the reaper had appeared, I’d shrugged them both off. I’d been stupid and short-sighted enough to allow my time to come.

Yet the reaper just stood there, watching me.

With my sword held at the ready, I considered if it was scared. Whether or not it was doubting the frozen moment in time when its scythe would harvest my soul. Perhaps it hadn’t expected me to resist, I ventured. After all, landing a strike on a swordsman of my caliber wasn’t easy for anyone.

The rational part of me didn’t think that was it, though. It didn’t fit with the concept of the end-bringer at all. The beast of decay was part of nature as we were told; it was integral to the cycle of the world. And while I’d never entirely agreed with that interpretation, especially not after my father had been ripped away from his life, it still shouldn’t have had any issue with a measly swordsman.

Then again, the word measly hadn’t described me for decades.

I stepped forward, my foot crunching on the path I walked almost every morning. *My* path, I reminded myself. The tranquil sanctuary that I’d cultivated for years. I was supposed to be safe when I walked it, and I had been until *it* had shown up.

A sneer formed on my face as I continued to approach. Its tattered cloak still drifted on the wind. Its scythe still balanced in silence. But as I neared, it looked up. It stared at me, nearly striking fear into my heart.

The reaper stopped and raised its scythe. It angled the ever-sharpened metal in my direction. For a moment, I could’ve sworn I saw a smile on its face. But I wasn’t sure, as it was already charging my way.

My body surged into action. The reaper disappeared from its spot and struck through the air like lightning to force me down with its scythe. Yet as the frozen moment passed with the shriek of clashing metal, I was left standing. The resistance was still fresh in my bones.

I’d parried it, I realized, on instinct and fear alone. As I glared back at its still form once more, picking apart details of the bone, I saw the surprise. I knew what it meant. The beast had never been parried before.

A grin grew across my lips as I readied my blade again. Its surprise would keep the scythe at bay for the moment, but I still had to be ready. I would never let my guard down.

As I’d expected, the surprise faded in short time and it was on me again. I watched it charge with inhuman speed, almost gliding over the ground. I only dodged with a stumble as its scythe cut right through where I’d been.

That attack had been faster than before, I noted. It had hit closer. I had to be ready.

I furrowed my brows and felt ice-cold fire flood my veins. It signaled the onset of battle, and I took the change in stride. Feeling the burn of sunlight on my skin, I stared back at the beast with everything I had and only barely ducked its next attempt at my life. The blade came through right where my head had been.

The scythe, however, never reached my former location. Instead, it turned at the last second. But even with the turn of steel, I was ready. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book. 

I parried the hit without a second thought. 

Surprise returned to its hooded, bleach-white face. The beast stared down at its unstained scythe, and I had to stifle a chuckle. It didn’t matter how fast it was. I would never let my guard down. 

I leapt backward, my feet already positioning themselves for the next attack. The beast growled, its tone dark enough to strike terror in any ordinary mind. But I was no ordinary mind—even at my age, I was as sharp. 

I narrowed my eyes, brought my sword out to the defense, and ignored the call to blunder. Its skeletal form charged me again—just as I’d predicted. My lips curled slightly as I turned in the nick of time and whipped the hilt of my blade around my wrist.

The clang that rang out was one to split mountains.

Both of our weapons fell, but I was more than ready for it. I swept mine up in an instant and was already twisting away. A smile blossomed across my lips. I would never let my guard down. 

Then, spinning back with my blade in hand, I shoved steel deep into the hooded cloak. My ears twitched at the screech of metal tearing through bone.

As soon as I heard it, I retracted my arm. My feet pushed me backward, and I swung my blade out to guard. Looking over the serene path turned battlefield, I saw too many familiar things. The ornate stone lining in the dirt. The shaded patch of trees. My humble homestead barely visible over the hills.

It had no right to be here, I told myself. It had no right to take me here. This was my *home,* world’s dammit. And I would never let my guard down.

Images flashed through my mind—parries, deflects, attacks. I was ready. The power in my muscles was already responding to clean commands. But as it turned out, none of it was needed.

The beast stood, paralyzed. 

Carrying the same surprise it had shown seconds before, the reaper stared at the grass. Its ash-black robe wavered in the breeze and its skeletal form hunched as though responding to a weight. Watching it, I relaxed my shoulders a hair. The situation was painted clear as day on its face. It had never been hit before either.

Ragged black cloth lifted back off its head to expose pale white bone to the sunlight above. Its dark eyes were riddled with confusion when it turned to me. It stared, and I almost looked, almost sealed my glorious fate. But at the last moment, I recognized the trick. 

Darkness crawled out of its eyes. I snapped mine shut before it could take me, my father’s proud face flashing in my mind. Another one of his warnings played back through my head.

*Never look into the face of death.*

The embodiment of decay rushed at me anew—I felt it in the air. Heard it. *Smelled* it. Its speed was even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike. Even with my eyes closed, with my most important sense stripped away, I would never let my guard down.

I snapped my eyes open while sprinting away, readied for the attacks that were sure to hit my unarmed side. I waited, my ears perked and my eyes sharp. The strikes never came. 

After a dozen strides, I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn’t. Instead, I saw the beast’s cracked, white skull with the hood completely off.

Bitterness fell on my tongue. It coated my mouth with disgust. I felt power radiating from in front of me; I felt it washing off the bone. Simply looking into its face forced my blood to run cold. Where I’d expected to see the same complete and utter shock, I saw confirmation of what I hadn’t wanted to be true. An expression more terrifying than any other.

A smile.

The crooked, skeletal grin was perfect and horrid at the same time. It spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. I was a warrior, a swordsman, a *knight*—I didn’t have time for worry. And yet, as I felt my gaze stay frozen, the dread only deepened. 

The beast didn’t rush at me. It didn’t move to attack. It didn’t even reach for its scythe. For some reason, it seemed done with the fight.

“Impressive display,” it said, words reaching my ears on the wind. Its voice came like the concept of decay itself, forcing me to shudder as it ate at my mind. I hadn’t seen its bony mouth move an inch.

“Thank you,” I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself into stance.

The beast noticed and raised a dismissive hand. “There is no need for that. I have no intention of keeping this up.”

“Then what do we do now?” I asked, keeping my gaze as harsh as nails. My fingers curled around my blade’s loyal grip. I knew it was playing with me—I knew the reaper’s words were a trick, but I would never let my guard down.

The beast chuckled dryly. ”You are unique.”

I glared at the thing, barely avoiding its eyes. It was toying with me and I knew it. Why couldn’t I take advantage? Why couldn’t I just strike now? No, I thought, dismissing the questions. It was smarter than that. It knew I wouldn’t let my guard down, and it wouldn’t let its guard down either. 

“And?” was the only word I mustered in response.

“It would be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.”

My gaze lifted, brows furrowing on my face. “What are you getting at?”

“I could give you another chance,” it said, the tone of its voice spawning hatred deep in my chest. The beast’s smile all but dropped as the force in its words made one thing abundantly clear.

It was serious. 

My mind raced, remembering my younger form longing for more time by the sword. Would it really give me another chance? 

“Yes,” it said, the dark words dragging hope out of my soul.

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

Its grin returned, more devilish than before. A chill ran down my spine. “You will have a different body. But you will retain your mind. Life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.”

I considered the offer against my better judgment. The same instincts that were guiding my stance screamed at me to stop. But as I stared at the beast, sunlight dancing on cracked bone, I could find no fault in its intentions.

“What do I have to do?”

Its grin grew wider. “One touch—and a new life is yours.”

Overcome by a dark, sudden, inexorable urge, I agreed. As though manipulated by some outside force, the desperation in my mind preyed on my memories and won out over all doubt. The reaper appeared next to me like a shot of ashen lightning.

Its finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip tightened and my mind screamed, but it was already too late. The bleach-white bone touched my skin and my body filled with ice. 

My mind burned. My bones froze. And I experienced the most agonizing second of the rest of my life before everything went black.

---

A jolt of motion startled me up from my slumber. I twisted, feeling only the most distant of pain. Everything was numb. A cold, unfamiliar haze was draped over my mind. I stared into the black, faintly wishing for the ability to feel again. Unfortunately, my wish was granted in short time.

My body snapped up. A frigid wind crashed against my face, sending shivers down my spine and a howl through my ears. In a second, everything came back and my mind spun through the images. New mixed with old and familiar with foreign as my mind swirled, but I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I clenched my jaw and waited for it to stop. And yet, as soon as it did, one thought was left, one that forced my lips into a smile. 

The beast hadn’t lied. 

When I opened my eyes, I hoped to see my land. I hoped to see my fields, the rows of crops that I was no longer even required to tend. I hoped to see my wife, the beautiful face that just barely escaped me. But the eyes that only vaguely felt like my own were met with a completely different sight. 

All around me, spinning in the wind as if just to mock me for my choices, was a dark forest that I couldn’t recognize. Feeling the horrid cold cut deeper, my smile faded.

I forced myself up, noting soreness in my bones. My muscles were hollow. My arms were shorter. My legs were… different. Everything about me felt *frail*, as if on the verge of collapse. And as I sat up on whatever rock my body had been strewn across, I felt sharp pain cut a deep pit through my stomach.

My brain started to spin again, the foreign thoughts, worries, and memories all coming back at once. As the waves passed, they were replaced with regret that was only my own. I shivered, the truth cementing in my mind.

This wasn’t what I’d wanted. It wasn’t what I’d wanted at all. I closed my eyes—if they even were my eyes—and shook my head, trying to force it all away. My efforts were useless as the world set in and one horrible thought echoed out in my head.

*I’d let my guard down.*

EDIT: Wow! I never thought I'd get so big a response. I'm glad so many people liked it! 

EDIT 2: Oh my! A legitimate gilding! Thank you so much kind stranger!

*****

I would’ve settled for a boring superpower. 20/20 vision. Perfect pitch. The ability to draw a perfect circle 100% of the time. Or no power at all even. No-shows actually get non-ability checks from the government now since they passed that law six months ago. No powers would have been better than what I wound up with.

I walk into the diner at 8:45. The last rays of the sinking sun temporarily warming the chill evening air. I usually go out as late as possible to minimize the number of people I run into. At this hour, there are only three patrons: a middle aged man sitting at the counter and a couple at a booth. A pair of bells above the door ring as it shuts behind me. 

“Come on in, have a seat!” I hear someone call out from the kitchen. “Be right with ya!”

I take a seat at the far end of the restaurant. It’s been five years since I discovered what my power was. It possibly started to manifest sooner but there’s no way of telling when. Most people get them in their teens, around puberty. Some kids take to their powers immediately, some develop them slowly over time. Some are late bloomers, and a rare few just never get any. 

Just like with puberty, it can be an awkward time. A friend of mine found out she could fly when she shot over the school on track and field day. Another kid I knew hit a baseball into orbit at a little league game. Destroyed a $70,000 solar panel on the ISS. That one made the news. You learn to control it more or less, but nobody really gets a hang of their powers until they meet the one.

The scientists don’t know how to explain it, but they think it’s a hormonal thing. They still don’t know if it’s the relationship that stabilizes the powers or the sudden improvement or amplification of both powers that solidifies the bond. But my friend found a guy who could control air currents. Turns out he could never generate enough lift to take off, but together she can lift him and he can whisk them along. They’ve been married for two years now. The guy with super strength kept hurting himself from constantly breaking things with his ability. During one of his extended stays at the hospital, he met a girl there for much the same reason. They knew it was a match made in heaven when they shook hands and didn’t crush each other’s fingers. Together, along with therapy and practice, I hear they’ve stopped tearing doors off hinges and breaking down walls.

I’m brought out of my reminiscing when I hear the couple across the room laughing merrily. There’s a spoon levitating between them. It dips into a dessert on the plate and floats gently over to girl and she takes a bite. They both laugh. He keeps saying things like “so what about this…” and “or how about…” Every time he pauses she giggles again, as if he’s just told a joke. I try not to think about it, but deep down, I secretly know the worst thing about my ability is that I’ll never find someone who I could be with.

Just then, the waitress zips out from the kitchen. I say zips because she’s moving almost too fast to track. She busses a table in one corner of the room, gives the man at the counter his bill, and refills the couple’s coffee cups in ten seconds flat. By the time I register that she’s on her way towards me, it’s too late to call out.

As soon as she gets within two meters of me, she immediately decelerates to a regular pace. Her shoes skid on the linoleum tiles and she goes sprawling to the ground in front of me with a loud grunt that sounds more surprised than hurt. The menu she was holding flies across the room. Everyone turns to look, startled. I flinch.

“Sally? Is everything okay?” I see a cook poke his head out of the kitchen. “What the hell happened?!”

I was out of my seat and helping her up about two seconds after she hit the floor. The man from the counter comes over with the cook.

“Ah… I’m alright Harry. I-I guess I tripped.” She winces as she gets to her feet. The skin on her knees and palms is badly scraped.

“Tripped?” the chef grunts. “Two years you been workin’ here and I ain’t never even seen you drop a spoon. You feeling alright hon?” The waitress, Sally, nods. “Jesus Sal, look at your hands!”

The man from the counter clears his throat.

“I believe I can help with that miss. I’m a doctor.”

“Oh it’s nothing a little iodine and some bandages wouldn’t fix doc, don’t worry about it.” The doctor smiles.

“Why don’t I just show you?” He takes her hands gently in his and… nothing happens. He turns his palms over, looking confused. “I don’t understand… there’s usually a slight glow… the wounds should be healing…” He seems understandably troubled.
The waitress gives a little gasp. “So it’s not just me… just before I fell, I think… I think my powers just… stopped working.” She gingerly rubs her wrist. “What about you Harry?” The cook thrusts a hand out. Nothing happens. He tries again. Still nothing.

“What in the hell… mine was working just a minute ago… this is weird.” He turns to me. “How about you buddy?”

All this time I’ve been shrinking back, my face feeling hot. Now I can’t bring myself to meet their gazes.

“Uh… my powers are working just fine, actually…” This is met with confused stares from the other two, but the doctor’s eyes light up.

“Ah I see. You’re a null, aren’t you?” I grimace at the term. From across the room, the spoon floating between the two lovebirds clatters noisily to the table. I grit my teeth. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by the doctor, who looks at the young couple and then back to me. My ears are burning now. I know I’ve technically done nothing wrong, but in a society where not having a superpower is considered a disability, taking them away might as well be a criminal act.

Harry the chef scratches his chin thoughtfully. “I ain’t never heard of that kinda’ power…”

“I’m really sorry miss” but she shakes her head.

“It’s not like you did it on purpose, hey? I guess I ought to be more careful sometimes.”

“What’s the range of your, ah, talent?” the doctor asks. 

“I can usually keep it to about two or three meters…” His eyes dart to the couple and back. “I should probably go… I’m sorry.”

“Naw, naw, kid, sit down. This I gotta see,” the cook says with a grin. That’s because it wasn’t a paramedic trying to heal a near-fatal injury or a firefighter trying to lift a broken beam off someone this time.

I take a deep breath and sit down. Closing my eyes, I go over the steps like I have a thousand times before. The chef takes a step back, then another. Suddenly, a little flame puffs into life in the middle of his palm. He chuckles. The doctor gently leads the waitress away. A soft white glow shines from his hands. The waitress straightens up. There’s not a scratch on her anymore.

“Wow Doc! The pain’s all gone too!” In the blink of an eye she retrieves the discarded menu and zooms back, coming to a careful stop before she gets too close. She walks towards me with exaggerated steps and hands it over. “No harm, no foul?” She smiles politely. The chef claps me on the shoulder and walks away. The doctor gives me a meaningful smile, tinged with pity.

“Uh… thanks…” With the show over Sally the supersonic waitress takes my order and then whips across the room to the couple. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but at one point or another each looks at me. The familiar feeling settles over me. That’s what it’s like, having my power. I couldn’t repel people any more if I had wound up with magnetism instead. Sally whips up with a pot of coffee and a mug, again coming to a halt before walking towards me, pouring and walking away.

The bell at the door jangles again. A young woman enters. I keep my eyes on the steam rising from the mug. 

“Take a seat hon, I’ll be right with ya.” The woman quickly finds a seat by the back, walking between tables. Sally, already back to her old rhythm it seems, goes zooming around to greet the new customer. She procures another cup and speeds over. What happens next only takes moments. In short order, the waitress roughly bumps into the table instead of stopping, fumbling with the pot and accidentally splashing coffee. The woman cries out and Sally immediately apologizes. Without thinking, she sets the pot down and bolts away to get a napkin—shooting right past the counter at twice the usual speed. She careens into a wall with a thwack that sounds significantly more painful than embarrassing and flops onto her back, out cold. There are a few seconds of stunned silence.

Harry pokes his head out from the kitchen: “Again Sal? How many times are—” he trails off when he sees her unmoving on the floor. “Jesus Christ! Sally!” The doctor is already by her side, hands glowing. He stops the chef before he can exit from behind the counter.

“You need to call an ambulance. Right now. This is beyond my talent to fix alone.” He turns back to the unconscious waitress, face grim. A big gash has opened up on her forehead.
“What the hell happened!?” 

“Oh God… I—I’m so sorry…” The woman who walked in is now on her feet, face white as a sheet, hands clasped in front of her mouth. A loud pinging sound interrupts before she can say another word. I turn in the direction of the young couple, who are both sitting mouth agape, staring at the same unfortunate spoon, now embedded in the far wall. Then the girl cries out.

“Jane!” This is her date, leaping across to see if she’s okay. The doctor strains his neck trying to see what’s going on. “I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened, the spoon, it just—I never…” but she’s not listening. She doesn’t appear hurt. Not physically. Still, she puts her hands over her ears and shrieks.
“Rich, oh God Rich, make it stop! It’s too loud! Too many voices!” The girl collapses out of her seat curling into a ball on the floor. “Make it stop!” she pleads. “Please make it stop!”

The boy doesn’t know what to do. He’s rubbing her back, trying to help. Silverware, dishes, table settings, all around the diner are starting to rattle.

“What the HELL IS GOING ON?!” Harry shouts above the din. Things devolve quickly after that. The glow from the doctor’s hands explodes into a brilliant whiteness. Sally’s eyes snap open and she arches her back with a loud gasp. 

“How…?” that doctor’s eyes widen in alarm. Simultaneously, both of Harry’s hands erupt in flames. 

“GAH FUCK!” The bewildered chef starts waving them around wildly, his sleeves catching fire. The girl Jane is still keening on the floor. Rich is crouched by her side, a maelstrom of utensils and tableware starts whirling around the room. Through it all, the young woman is still standing, frozen. Tears of fear and horror pouring down her cheeks. A look I’ve never seen on someone else.

Then it clicks.

I stand up and walk over through all the chaos, until I’m right beside her. I put my hand on her shoulder and turn her to face me. She meets my gaze. Something in my eyes must be speaking to her too, and that’s when I know for sure. I wrap my arms around her and pull her close. She’s soft and small and smells like lavender. I feel hot tears soaking through my shirt.

“It’s okay,” I say. “Everything is going to be okay.”

Everything stops, all at once.

All the dishes fall to the floor. The blinding light from the doctor’s hands disappears. Harry’s firearms sputter and go out. The room is silent, except for a few whimpers coming from Jane, and the muffled sobbing coming from the woman in my arms. 

The doctor tends to everyone in short order. Sally was fine the moment the flash hit. He says he never had results that fast, even with his partner right next to him. Harry has some light burns, but the doc takes care of those. Besides needing a new shirt and having no more hair on his arms, he’s fine. He grumbles about closing early tonight. Sally agrees. Rich had a cut above the eye where an errant saucer clipped him, and Jane had a small headache, but both are no worse for wear.

He approaches me wordlessly. There’s a small gash on my forearm I didn’t notice in all the confusion. He holds out his hand to heal it. I start to protest, but before I can say anything, the warm glow appears around his fingers. My arm tingles for a moment and when he pulls away, I see my cut is gone. I’m flabbergasted, but the doctor smiles knowingly. He gives me a nod and a wink and walks away.

I turn my attention to the woman. My soul mate, I realize, and I don’t even know her name yet. I loosen my embrace and she pulls her head away, but her arms are still tightly wrapped around me, and mine around her. She looks blurry. I blink and wipe at my eyes. Her face is red and raw and beautiful. Messy hair and cheeks shiny with tears. The red rimming her eyes makes the blue inside them pop. 

“Hi” I say. She laughs. A low, soft giggle. I can’t help but laugh a little too.

“Hi.” She buries her face in my chest and says something else, but I can’t make it out. 

“What was that?” I ask.

“Don’t let go,” she repeats, softly. “Don’t ever let go.”

“I won’t. I promise.”

LifeProTips,LPT: don't use your child's embarrassing stories as dinner party talk. They are your child's personal memories and humiliating them for a laugh isn't cool.,"I've probably listened to my mum tell one particularly cringe worthy story dozens of times and I think everyone she knows has been told it. Every time she tells it, most of the time in front of me, I just want to crawl under the table and hide. However, that would give her another humiliating story to tell.

Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you have a right to humiliate them for a laugh.

I do think that telling about something cute they once did (pronouncing something wrong, for example) is different to an embarrassing story, but if your child doesn't like you telling about it then you should still find something else to talk about.

Edit: I mean telling stories from any part of your child's life at any part of your child's life. When I say child, I don't mean only someone under 18, I mean the person that is your child.

Edit again: This post blew up, can't believe how big it has gotten. Getting a lot of comments from the children (including adult children) involved but also parents which is awesome.

Im also getting a lot of comments about how this is a self-selecting sample and in the wider world, not as many people would support this. All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people?

There is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.

I don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down. Embarrassing someone to give them thicker skin is a massive gamble between ended up with someone being able to laugh at themself and someone who is insecure, or at worst fuels the fire of an anxiety disorder.

Comfort them first, then follow up with 'do you want advice or do you want me to just listen?'. But other times, they just need to let someone outside of the conflict know what happened, and then they want to talk about something else. Talk about your own day, show them the latest funny thing you saw, go do something fun together. This question sets boundaries and builds trust. It shows you can be there in any way they need.

LifeProTips,"LPT: Stop engaging with online content that makes you angry! The algorithms are keeping you angry, turning you into a zealot, and you aren't actually informed!","We all get baited into clicking on content that makes us angry, or fuels ""our side"" of a contentious topic.  The problem is that once you start engaging with ""rage bait"" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.

You feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things.  First your anger obviously.  But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more ""correct"" than they/you actually are.  You start to fall into the trap of ""echo chambers"", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions.

For example:  If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions.  This causes the following

* You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority
* You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters
* You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing  view
* You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber)

Make a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively.  Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want.  You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you.  The people fighting back and forth online over the issues of the day are a small minority of people that represent nobody, nor are they representative of even their side.

I am fairly young (26) so don’t really have any hard feelings about it. I always felt I needed others to enjoy the same hobbies as me to actually enjoy doing them. This made me miss a lot of opportunities to just enjoy life. 

If you want to do something (anything, be it physical, mental) just do it. By all means, extend an invite to others, but if nobody makes plans, just go do it yourself. 

Instead of asking “hey, we should go out and do ______ some time”, say “hey, I’m going to go _________, did you want to come?”

This way you already have plans to do whatever it is you’re doing, and you’re just extending an invite. Not actually basing whether you will do thing on someone else.

I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

EarthPorn,The FCC just voted to end net neutrality. But the fight isn’t over. We can get Congress to overturn their vote using a Congressional Resolution of Disapproval. It only takes a simple majority in the House and Senate. We can do this.,"The FCC [just voted](https://www.battleforthenet.com) to repeal all existing net neutrality protections. They are giving giant ISPs like Verizon and Comcast the power to control what we can see and do online with new fees, throttling, and censorship. This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. **This fight isn’t over though, there is still a clear path to victory.**

The organizations behind [Battle For The Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via [Congressional Review Act](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43992.html) (CRA). 

The CRA let’s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. **But it won’t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.**

**We can’t stop now. [Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)**

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:
>I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.”

**You can also text BATTLE to Text ""BATTLE"" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers**

We can still win this. Even if you’ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to https://www.batttleforthenet.com

How does buying and selling stocks work?

What is short selling?

What is a short squeeze?

What is stock manipulation?

[What is a hedge fund?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/l6ptb7/eli5_what_is_a_hedgefund/)

We have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:

[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)

[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)

We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.

Additionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored."" This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)

Edit II: the point I'm trying to make is that in both cases it is wrong to encourage unhealthy behaviors under the guise of support or because you enjoy the effects of the dangerous behaviors. 

Not only that, but you're basically saying they aren't fun unless they drink and they aren't beautiful unless they're overweight.  You're completely disregarding their health and quality of life. Body positivity should mean you're beautiful no matter what size and we shouldn't equate ANY weight with beauty. Weight should be about health only.

tifu,TIFU / My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off,"
A little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.

I searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.

There are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. 

I don’t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it’s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she’d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I’m a bit annoyed. 

I pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. 

Not to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it’s just her?

It’s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  

I thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. 

[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)

TL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn’t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. ",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

tifu,TIFU by owning a Golden Retriever while being Black.,"Sigh. 

Work was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. 

Food ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. 

Pertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. 

Both dogs were in the neighbor’s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog’s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the ”voice” for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. 

Pup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling ”RUNAWAY” and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. 

I didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. 

”Is that your dog?”

My bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? 

I’ll be nice because you brought my food. 

But she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, ”okay weird” but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking “okay weird...” again but didn’t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. 

I went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. 

Uh...ok? What’s going on here?

I go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn’t notice me. I walk up like I’m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you’ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I’m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. 

I don’t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. 

I continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor’s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. 

It clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. 

No hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver’s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. 

I don’t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor’s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn’t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. 

However, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. 

I splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn’t end worse. 

TL; DR

Ordered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn’t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn’t get shot but got cake in the end.

Edit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!

Taking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I’m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.

I appreciate the sub this was posting to for restoring it after being removed. I apologize that this topic bent the rules and didn’t think 100% before submitting. This was a way to vent. Thank you for allowing this to be a place of dialogue!

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

tifu,TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years…,"TIFU by lying to my wife for 13 years…

My wife hates orange and lime flavored candies. I love them. Well, love the orange, like the lime. 

So, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. 

What she doesn’t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. 

Shortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. 

So I haven’t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I’ve never said a word. I’ve enjoyed eating my little lies. 

Until last night…

We had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. 

She turned to me and asked if I’ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. 

I was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal…. She asked how long I’ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we’ve been married. 

She quit giving me the gummy bears she didn’t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. 

I don’t think I’ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.

Edit: 

We don’t eat these every day. A few times a year at most.

I don’t just get the “rejects.” It’s a shared bag. Whenever she grabs a few, she would pick out the orange and green and hand to me. Just like I would give the pineapple to her (bleh). 


TL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by cumming into a coconut,"EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

EDIT 2: RIP inbox

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

EDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit's history. Lord save me.",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my GF","Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. I'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.

So while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.

I'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.

Later on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

We are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

Tl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

They banned me on r/AskReddit for it.

I posted about it on here and changed my name to r/NazisStoleMyBirthday

r/AskReddit unbanned me.

This post blew up and got really popular. It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit

This morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.

Some of you won’t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it’s worth, I would never say things that, much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account, but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.

This was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again, some won’t believe that and that’s ok.

If you care, you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.

tifu,TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW,"So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

UPDATE: There’s a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. It wasn’t. She was with this guy for 3 years.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.,"Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""Please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by Watching Live Porn For The First Time (NSFW),"I'm sitting in my room pretty horny and bored so I wanna go watch some porn

and I always get these ads about pornhub live and I've never checked it out.

So I'm like, alright I'm gonna check it out, see what it's all about

I open it and I see all these hot girls. I go into a couple and on the right side, they have a chat where you can type. but in order to chat with the girls, I have to make an account.

I entered my email, password, and they have something weird that is that you have to enter a username

obviously didn't wanna use my real name so I write the first name that comes to mind, jakob69420

and then on the next page, it says. Enter your credit card,. I'm already skeptical but it says.. it's 100% free, it's only for if things get hot and you wanna donate

and I'm like.. eeeeehhh... but I'm already so far in the process that I'm like ok fuck it.. let's go

So now I'm in and I watch a few and they're like just sitting there, they're not really doing anything. nobody was showing any tits, a little ass shaking, but pretty underwhelming overall.

So to find the best one I just hold control on my keyboard and open a ton of tabs so I can find one that actually does something sexy.

and I flip through these tabs at the top and it would popup this annoying thing that said. You can only watch one live stream at the time. 

this popup would come a few times where I had to click like an orange button to refresh.

and then I land on this really old like 60-year-old gilf, and she's just sitting there, there's like 8 people watching live.

then there was a popup with an orange button and instinctively my mouse just goes to it and right as I'm about to click the button I see it says, enter private room $5 dollars.

I click it, and I'm like.. ""No! o fuck!"" I'm not sad loosing $5 dollars but eh, couldn't it be somebody that's a little bit sexier?

Now she's like smiling and she say's ""heeey Jakob"".. Immediately she's pulling her tits out and she grabs a dildo laying next to her. she has this underwear on that has like a velcro flap, and she snaps it open and I can see this really old, slightly hairy pussy. 

I'm like.. alright man, I fucking paid for this, so better give it a go, kinda like shamefully jacking off.

Now she keeps saying Jakob over and over again, moaning, and I mean.. she puts on a pretty good show, she was pretty hot, but I mean she's fucking 60...

I start writing in the chat that she should talk dirty to me and shit. 

I'm gonna spare you all the details, but after a few minutes I cum

and I'm like, thank you, bye! 

I Close the window and go back to watching youtube and chilling out.

Later that night, I go to check my email, and I see this receipt from pornhub live and it turns out... it didn't cost just $5... It cost $5 dollars per minute!!

So that's how I spent $72 dollars on a 60-year-old woman calling me Jakob

tifu,TIFU by banging my first cousin.,"So, didn't happen today, but last weekend. Finally getting around to really processing it all and I guess trying to deal with it.

Went out for drinks with my girlfriend and met up with my younger cousin at the bar. We'd all hung out once before and had a great time. My cousin invited a couple of her friends to the bar too; we did some barhopping. I got shitfaced pretty unintentionally (The last bar was, I swear, not putting any mixers in my cocktails, they were straight alcohol). So anyway we're about to leave and my cousin's friends are trying to get her home, because she's shitfaced too. Well, my gf was our DD so we offered to let her stay in our spare room. Everyone was cool with that because who's safer than family, right?

Wrong. We get home and (I had to piece together some of this later because I blacked out for most of it) apparently initially everything was cool. My cousin went to the spare room and my gf got her situated. The problems started a little later when I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to walk straight out of my bedroom with my girlfriend in it, and into my cousin's room. I don't particularly remember much except for two details which I guess are not important to the story. Well, okay so one might be. I remember her giving me a *very* enthusiastic BJ, which, as you can imagine, makes a lot of noise. Apparently after a while my gf came out of the room wondering where I was because I just fucking disappeared. She didn't barge into the room or anything, but she heard the noises which is pretty fucking obvious. So at that point, she left. Like, me. She left me, and I don't blame her.

Anyway that means I wake up the next morning, having blacked out, oblivious that my gf was gone already, but I'm fucking naked next to my naked cousin. There's cum all over the bed where her face was, she didn't even sleep with a pillow. There's obviously no hiding this but I'm still half-drunk and I went to try to go sneak back into my room, which I found empty. So yeah.

I haven't heard from my gf all week, and I'm sure we're done, and I don't blame her. All I can hope for now is that this shit doesn't get out to my family, because I would probably implode. No, my cousin and I are not going to start hooking up regularly. It's actually super awkward and she has hardly said a word to me either. Again, I don't blame her.

TL;DR drunkenly slept with my cousin, ruined my relationship, family might hear about it, I'm an idiot.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by confiscating my son’s Gameboy and hiding it. For 18 years...,"My son was not doing his homework so I confiscated his GBA. I told him he would get it back next week.

Well he’s a pretty clever dude and knew all my hiding places, so I put it someplace he would never look.

Except I suffered a TBI a few years earlier and I forget stuff. So when he did his homework and asked for it back after a week, I ... could not find it. Aargh. I looked everywhere.

Narrator: Obviously not everywhere...

Then we moved house. And I still didn’t find it. 

Spongebob: 18 YEARS LATER...

I was donating some coats I had not worn in a long time. And in the pocket of a Viennese trench coat from the 1930’s, I found... his Gameboy Advance. And turned it on. And it WORKED. Pokémon appeared. 

I put fresh batteries into it and handed it to my 28 year old son. Who proceeded to laugh for a good five minutes. Then played it for a few hours. Then proceeded to tell my wife and other adult children how silly I was.

TL/DR: Hid kid’s Gameboy, forgot where. Found it almost 20 years later. Family has further proof that I’m an idiot.",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU by thinking a woman was a boy, and groping her boob. (kind of NSFW, though it happened at work)","Obligatory this actually happened a little over a year ago, and throwaway because I don't want people on my main account to know what I do for a living.

So, I work for the TSA, and have for a few years now. It's a good job overall. I'm underpaid, but the benefits are nice, and I get overtime when I want it.

A little over a year ago, during the week leading up to Christmas, we had some really bad weather that delayed all the flights. I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer

I was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it's a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.

Mom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.

Kid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he's about 13, maybe 14.

I hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.

I tell him that I have to pat that area down. He's a little nervous, I figure that because he's so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.

I do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn't look chubby at all.

I move to the right side of the chest, read what's on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He's not wearing sweatpants, \*she\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn't even know the couple that just came through.

I look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.

I immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what's wrong, and I explain the situation to her.

My supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she's trying not to laugh.

She takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.

Once that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it's fine, that it wasn't the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.

She tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won't happen, and I shouldn't be worried.

That reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.

I swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there's no way I have the energy to cook dinner.

I saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).

I apologize again, she says it's fine, and I ask her if she's planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.

I tell her that I'm getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it's only fair that I buy her dinner.

She agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.

She said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it's not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men's bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn't walk into the ladies' room.

She laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.

She said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.

I agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.

We just celebrated our one year anniversary.

She has long hair now.

tifu,"TIFU by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.","I can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because I'm an idiot. 

My dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" My immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

Never going back.

TL;DR  Today I fucked up by licking my dentist",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by jumping into a lake in my bra/panties to save a man that turned out to be an elite military scuba diver in training,"I’m couch-surfing with my sister and her BF; I work for him at the lake-side bar, trying to pay for college. My state is “open” and while I’m not thrilled, I need both the job and my scored sofa accommodations to make it work. To give them their space, and myself a break from the doomscrolling, I take a run by the lake in the mornings. This lake is bombass and draws scuba divers to the flooded town at the bottom.

Today, I was in my own head running when a dark mass floated to the surface 40 feet away. I was on the craggy side of the lake and this dude looked dead. D.E.A.D. Facing away from me, his head was tipped back, eyes closed, bobbing like a fishing lure. No one else was around, so I thought he was quantum crazy out here scuba diving alone at the crackass of dawn, giving himself the bends or some nonsense.

Like a jackass, I didn’t yell at him to check-in. Instead, I toed off my shoes and stripped to my skivvies to save the imbecile. The movie trailer in my head had me taking three glorious steps and launching into the deep blue water, black widow style. Instead, my tender feet hit the sharp rocks and I contorted under the pain like a slinky as I uncoordinatedly pitched myself into the water, doing a side-flop. I was also wearing my contacts so I swam hard in his direction with my eyes closed.

When I open them, he was dead-ass staring at me like I’d lost my ever-lovin’ mind, so I blurted, “Are you okay?”

He removed the regulator and incredulously said “yes”.

My brain blue-screened while I tread water. The lake felt infinitely deep. Before I could terrify myself by hearing the jaws theme song, I turned to nope the hell out of there, yelling over my shoulder, “I thought you needed saving” to explain my idiocy.

As I pivoted, another dude cleared his throat from 30 feet away on the other side. I never heard a sound from him so I freaked out, failing and belting an ear wounding scream at him.

Both asshats laughed as a few more heads surfaced around us. I was surrounded by divers all wildly entertained by my ridiculous high-octane FU. After pointing to me and the beach, the merman that was my original target cautiously swam toward me after I nodded and “escorted” me to the shore.

The beach was much further than I had anticipated, so I was trying to low-key breath, hiding my need to suck all of the O2 from the air. Also, the comedy of the situation consumed me and I started to giggle. Finally, I joked, “Dude, you are lucky you weren’t actually dying because It would have taken everything I have to drag your sorry ass this far.”

He chuckled before offering me a “tow.”

“Hell, no! Not gonna happen.” Even if I had to dog paddle, I wouldn’t openly accept that defeat.

He quietly mocked me the rest of the way to the shore. I’m a secret sap for it.

They were cadets or recent graduates from a military college, here for the summer. They’ve been training in pools and were doing some “open water” exercises; they had been out there at least part of the night. I’m sure I blew-up whatever drill they were running. He’s training for pre-dive school (?) and since I am an expert googler, I’m guessing that means combat diving.

At the shore, I did my best to throw my shoulders back and march out of the water in my sports bra and undies in front of what I can only imagine are some pretty badass men. I did invite him and his clandestine crew for an absurdly overpriced beer at the bar tonight before shame-jogging back into the woods for my clothes.

TL;DR I tried to save an injured diver-ended up crashing some kind of military training.

EDIT: It's Lake Jocassee in SC. Also, the mereman cheated: he was wearing a floaty vest and fins, that bastard. Ok, I’ll admit there is a part of me that is attracted to his mysterious appearance from the shadow realm, and I’m definitely imaging that he’s constructed from some kind of aluminum steel alloy, but he was also funny and kind. I was vibing his proclivity for witty and sarcastic comments and have a million questions I want to ask him. Ha

EDIT2: Okay, at work now and had to turn off the notifications because you snippers are blowing me up. To all the ladies giving advice earlier...yes, I left the dragon-flies at home and went full cute sundress and Jesus sandals. Tried to wear my hair straight, but it's hot as hate out here and it'll be beach wave sweaty before long. My sister's BF has blabbed the whole thing and all of the staff is in full-on ribbing mode. Kinda great actually. They are currently reading the Reddit post so they are cackling at you people too. So, even if he doesn't show, we're gonna have a great night. We have a long way to go since it's just the dinner crowd, but thanks for making my day great people.

EDIT3: Solid dinner crowd, but no mereman, or frog prince as you people have started to call him. Our lakeside drinking crew will start rolling in another 1-2 hours. I thought you salty bastards of TIFU would chew me up and spit me out, but look at you all showing up in the name of love! You guys are awesome, even if I get ditched it was worth the day with you.

EDIT4: 1 hor later. Still no show :(

EDIT5: HE SHOWED! Holy shit, a little bit ago. Yes, I was as dorky as you would have imagined and now I’m typing this from the bathroom like a dumbass again, but I feel like you people are on the ride with me. He’s handsome and funny and he smells great. Yes, I hugged him. I’m southern…its what we do…not the smelling, the hugging. He’s nice, and smart and keeps defending me from my jackass friends at the bar, who have almost called him merman to his face. I think he low-key likes that everyone knew who he was, but not sure how he’ll feel about being a Reddit celebrity. I’ve learned a lot about him, but it wouldn’t be fair to share without his permission. His whole crew did not come, only one and his bud immediately started flirting with my co-worker. That’s a good sign. I think. Holy, shit you’d think I’d never met up with a guy before. Also, my friend straight up asked him if he saw my “dragonfly undies that look like penises with MASSIVE, glow-in-the-dark turquoise blue balls” only she used the Reddit version  (thanks for that nickname Reddit). He didn’t answer but smirked the truth to me after she left. It was cheeky but cute. He’s also been sharing some of the shit that he's been taking today from being “saved”. He has the same self-deprecating sense of humor as me. I think we are vibing. So, that’s all the updates for tonight. He’s getting the rest of my attention. Keep sending me those good vibes and peace people.

EDIT6: Last and final update because you guys are not letting up. I know this may seem weird since I posted this whole situation out into cyberspace for everyone to see, but yesterday it was just a comical story about a guy I didn't think I would ever see again. Something funny to share when we all need a giggle. Today...well...it feels different to talk about him now that we've spent some time together. I like him. There’s chemistry and similar interest and we have plans to see each other again. I don’t need the pressure of Reddit to help me screw things up. You guys know I’m a bit of an expert in that regard. That’s all, so go do something you love and find a way to at least balance the doomscrolling with some belly laughs. Sending much love to each of you.

EDIT7: “Updates!” You people keep screaming over 3 weeks later. Don’t you have better things to do than pester me about my love life? Ha. The merman, the frog prince, the dashing man from depths, the king of the shadow realm (and the many other nicknames that Reddit has bestowed) is still very much in my life. He’s better than I can describe with my mortal words. Fangirl him if you must because I will understand. Thank you all for the well-wishes and positivity that this post has given. I hope something amazing and magical happens to each of you, and if it happens to be shamefully funny, I hope you will share because we all need as many laughs as we can get.

tifu,TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV,"This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

OH and thanks for the gold! Things are going so fast here I didnt even see it until now. Thank you unknown and kind strangers!

tifu,TIFU Tipping 140% to a Pizza Delivery Driver,"My buddy and I ordered a pizza last night. Unaware that I already paid with my debit card, I walk to my door with $30 and gave him a 20% tip on top of that which had been paid online.

The driver was about in his mid 30's, barely spoke English and he was driving a beat up car. He said ""thank you!"" very enthusiastically which made me realize in about 2 seconds that I just gave him double the money for the order, which he would obviously receive as a tip. I was about to admit my mistake and ask for the money back... before I saw his reaction while he was walking to his car.

He had a smile from ear to ear like he found the cure for Covid or struck gold or something. He even did this little mini jump before he hopped into his car. I'm not exactly Bill Gates, I still have debts to pay, but I'm glad I fucked up to help someone who needed the money more than I did.

Anyways, I felt pretty dumb after, but the joy I saw in that man made my week. Not a very interesting story, but it was pretty cool for me, as my Dad moved to Canada from across the world with only a bike and a few hundred bucks.

TL;DR Paid double for a pizza by being drunk. No regrets. Ok... little to no regrets.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by thinking my son was having gay sex when he was just eating Hummus,"So I (39F) have a son (15M) and he brought a friend round today.

They immediately went to their room and I assumed they would just play some video games or whatever so I was totally fine leaving them. 

 It was about 30 minutes in when I was walking past, I heard sounds such as 'Omg that's so good' and 'Its so good with that in it' and various 'mmmm' sounds.

It really sounded like they were having gay sex, I was super weirded out by it so I quickly went downstairs and waited for his friend to leave. When this friend left an hour or two later I asked my son what they were doing in his room (because although I don't mind him being gay, and ik it's normal for teenagers to have sex, a condom really should be used) so I planned to confront him about that.

However the answer shocked me to my very core. They weren't having sex, they were _eating hummus_.

I was shocked, and initially didn't believe it. We had never had hummus before and I asked him to show me the hummus if this was true. So he did, and I ate hummus for the first time, and oh my god was it good. We experimented with different things in it like bread and carrots and it was great. Apparently his friend had heard about how he had never had hummus before and thought this was absurd so had planned a date for a hummus party.

So yeah, it ended up being quite a good ending, i discovered how nice hummus was.


TLDR: Thought my son was having gay sex, he just really liked hummus.",Entertainment

tifu,TIFU and realized I wasted my whole life. at 42 years of age took the safe path as a dentist. My advise to people at a similar age.,"I think I have wasted my whole life to be honest.

I am Joe, I have been a lurking for a while. I created this account to get my story across, I have no idea what I am planning to achieve by doing so, but I hope it can help those who are at crossroads and are stuck between passion and safety.

For the past 15 years of life, I have been a dentist, a path that I chose after leaving a job to study further in the hopes I will make more money. I do not even know why I cared about money when I did not even spend any of it. I met my wife before I started school, when I was 20, when I was a risktaker, a dreamer and wanted to change the world.

Now I’m in a place where I have chronic pain, a cheating wife, kids who don’t love me, a life of staring into mouths all day, a dull brain, no more passions and hopes, no real purpose in life.

I wanted to work as a social worker or an educator, but my parents and wife thought that I could help people in other ways that pay well. They convinced me to take dentistry and I did. I hated every minute of school, I did not want to be in a place where my back would ache, neck would ache and it was not solving the real cause of the problem, but just the result of what happens after people let go of their teeth. All my friends convinced me that it will be rewarding, and I will make a lot of money when I am out of school and I let them.

When I was a young man, I wanted to do so many things, I used to play music, I wanted to become a musician, I wanted to be a teacher raising future people who could change the world. I loved physics and mathematics, but my parents told me to follow money instead of passions.

Today I have 2 kids, a wife and they all expect me to provide them with a luxurious lifestyle. I have never cared for money, the most enjoyable time in my life was when I was sleeping on a futon in a rental running a small business selling jars of jam made with strawberries from a local farm and also working as a tutor for a bunch of spoilt kids. I had very little, but I was happy, I feel like I should have become an educator/business owner instead of taking a career I hate.

From the past 15 years, I have developed chronic pain from doing dentistry, gained at least 20 kilos, made a million dollars but for what? I can’t even do anything because of chronic back pain.

After becoming a dentist, I worked 9-4, 5 days a week,  I would come back home exhausted, plan my next day, manage the business side of things, have dinner with my kids and wife, sleep and repeat. Have a few weeks here and there as holidays where I would take my family away for a vacation.

My kids don’t even talk to me anymore, my wife and I have not had sex for months and I’m 100% that she’s cheating on me with a better-looking man who is older than me, I have seen her phone and confirmed this, but I will not bring it up because I don’t have anyone except her left in my life, she has been my only support throughout this and if she leave, I have nothing left. My kids will probably be split and hate their dad because their mom has raised them, my life feels like a joke.

I remember when I was in my 20s, I used to be popular with the girls, I had countless opportunities to go out with girls I found more attractive than my wife but I didn’t because I cared for her. In hindsight, I should have just done what I wanted to. Maybe my wife would still be attracted to me, I would be healthier and fitter.

If I had my life all over again, I would not settle down so early, I would date more and find more interesting friends, I would never choose to be a dentist!

I should have stuck to my passion for business/physics/teaching/music etc. Even though I would have been broke, I think I would not have cared, I would wake up everyday working towards a better future, work harder because I am not handed money on a silver platter, the list can go on.

I feel that it's too late to go back to pursue my passions now, my kids have expectations, my wife has expectations, society thinks that I am useful and important.

Sorry if this is a long read, but I just had to say it. I truly have made a joke out of the one life I was given by choosing money, stability, safety, other people’s opinions over my real passions.

To all the people stuck between money/stability/safety and passions, just chase your passions because the safe path does not guarantee that you’ll live a life that was worth living.

TL:DR – I ruined my life by continuing  to do what I hated – dentistry. It has ruined my marriage, health, family, my passions, my mind. Do what you are passionate about, f\*\*\* societal expectations.

EDIT:  
I was not expecting this post to get so much attention as it has, I just posted it as a whim to tell atleast someone about it. I was very emotional at the time and did not proof read anything that I typed.

Honestly reading your thoughts, encouragement and most importantly your own personal stories, I feel like I'm gaining a new perspective at life and how I can change it, for the first time in a very long time, I feel that maybe this is not the end. I don't have to die a slave to a system that does not support my life or adds any value to my life.

I will put down answers to recurring questions below as they come up and keep you guys updated on what I will do with my life in this post. Thank you reddit for giving me hope.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by telling my son's new doctor we are Anti-Vaxx,"Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, ""Okay, well I have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

Tl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

Edit: Of course we took the gardasil. Shout out to nurse Pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. I wish everyone could have a nurse Pete. Also, since I'm editing, thanks for the awards!",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by pretending to be deaf for the entire quarantine.,"So, three months ago or whenever it was that the Quarantine started I started an online course for a few subjects. To provide some background, these aren’t my school classes or anything and I’ve never met these people before. There are maybe ten other kids in class and the teacher is actually pretty great. 

So the first two days go pretty well but on the third day I fuck up big time. We were in between a Physics class that had already been going on for an hour and I’d completely gotten distracted half way through. I have an incredibly low attention span and this was already too much for me. 

When the teacher called my name to answer his question, I had no idea what he’d been talking about so I tried to google it. However I have shitty internet so it took like really long to load and the teacher was getting pissed as to why I wasn’t responding and why I was typing. So, completely freaking out I decided to text him on the Google Meet chat and make an excuse that my laptop’s audio AND microphone are not working today and I’ve been reading the subtitles which take quite some time to load so I hadn’t quite gotten his question. 

In my immense panic I phrased this somewhat vaguely and said - *I can’t actually hear I’ve been reading the subtitles they take quite some time to load*

To which the instructor said - *Oh! I’m so sorry. I wasn’t aware that you are deaf*

In my intense panic and anxiety I just went along with it. 

Dumb as fuck.

It actually worked out fine, I’d type out all the answers sent to me and even bought a hearing aid that I sometimes wore in class. Now I say *sometimes* because I don’t actually have the focus and commitment to remember to put it on every class. When asked about it I told the people in class that even with the hearing aid I can’t hear much so I don’t usually bother wearing it. They bought it. 

Everyone in class likes me a lot now too and they find me very endearing. There’s a girl, Carla who says I have the most beautiful smile she’s ever seen. So this was actually going really well for me. 

But like most of my antics, this backfired on me big time. 

When I made this godforsaken decision all that time ago I was sure I’d get away with it. We were never going to meet irl. However, about a week ago the instructor decided to meet irl as the lockdown in my country has been lifted. I spent all night watching videos of deaf people and trying to figure out how to behave. I decided to pretend to also be completely dumb so I wouldn’t have to try to speak like them. It seemed very hard and I didn’t want to try. 

So anyway we meet up and everything goes well. No one uncovers my secret or anything. I spend the entire irl meet with Carla who is completely fucking stunning in real life. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s kind. We keep handing each other notes on tissue papers and it’s the cutest shit ever. I haven’t ever been this attracted to anyone in my entire life. Toward the end of the meet however, Carla hands me a tissue paper with one little heartbreaking sentence on it.

*Will you date me?*

Fuck. 

Panicking, I tell her I need some time to think and she’s chill with it. 

I’m supposed to be meeting up with her tomorrow. I can’t pretend to be deaf and dumb while dating her it’s fucking impossible but if I have to keep this charade up I’ll have to let her go and I don’t want to do that either.

There’s also the other option where I tell her it was all an act. Best case scenario is the extreme embarrassment + amazing girlfriend and the worst case scenario is she thinks I’m an asshole and I lose her anyway. 

tl;dr - I pretended to be deaf because I wasn’t paying attention in class and now I might be missing out an amazing girlfriend.

Edit - She just texted me what time to pick her up. The date is actually TONIGHT not tomorrow so I have way lesser time to make this decision than I expected. Haha, I’m like a disaster that keeps on happening. Anyways, you should have an update in about 6-7 hours which is when I’ll meet her.

UPDATE - So this is the update y’all have been waiting for, I just got back from the date with Carla.

So basically I prepared really hard for the date, googled what the appropriate flowers for apologizing for your lies are and got her White Orchids. I then put on my best clothes and set out. 

She’d come to the date with a cute little notepad and two pencils for us to write notes in which melted me instantly but I was so anxious and nervous that at first I couldn’t bring myself to tell her. But as we sat waiting for our order to arrive, I kinda snapped cause of guilt and scribbled down into the notebook.

*Hey, there’s not easy way to break this but I’m not actually deaf . . . . . Or dumb*

To which she replied with,

*I know you’re not deaf but you ARE pretty dumb :)*

At which point I said *What the fuck* out loud.

She then laughed and explained that she’d thought I was so cute that she’d googled me long ago and found my Instagram which has highlighted stories from concerts where I’m screaming and vibing. So she only asked me out to figure out for how long I’d keep it going. 

So she was actually playing me the whole time.

I was feeling pretty bummed that she only wanted to date me for that but nevertheless I apologized profusely and showed her the Reddit post to explain myself. 

Best.move.ever. (Thank you so much everyone in the comments who asked me to do this)

She found the post funny and cute and ‘adorkable’. I told her I totally understand if she wants to end the date now but she didn’t! We had a great time and aren’t officially dating or anything but we did set a second date for next Wednesday.

She also told me that while she understands why I did what I did and that anxiety, especially social anxiety is so hard to deal with but she also believes that I was a little offensive especially with the hearing aid. She explained to me why that was so insensitive and I’d like to apologize for anyone I might have offended on here, it really wasn’t my intention!

Also, for our second date we’re planning to volunteer at a centre for deaf kids so I can redeem myself. 

Thank you fucking Reddit, y’all might’ve just got me a girlfriend!",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by asking Reddit which ethnic group to exterminate,"Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you’re all giving me, it’s rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won’t necessarily be responding to them all.

I’m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn’t the original intention, but it’s a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It’s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it’s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they’ve subsided and I’m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn’t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I’m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it’s been a truly interesting experience. I didn’t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn’t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It’s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I’m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It’s been great to see this happen, and I’m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

TL;DR - Made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks I’m a racist bastard.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by realizing the older woman I’ve been sleeping with for months is my coworkers mom.,"**UPDATES BELOW**

Throwaway account, this literally happened like an hour ago. So I (M25) have been involved with an older woman (F44) lately. 

It started a few months ago with the onset of Coronavirus, I was on Tinder trying to find someone to hook up with during quarantine so as to stay safe and also kill some time. I saw this very attractive older woman and decided to swipe right because you know, it’s every 20-something year olds dream to hook up with a Milf. A few days go by and I get a notification that I have a new match. Wahoo! I open up the app and lo and behold it’s the fine ass cougar I was hoping for. 

We start chatting and flirting, it’s going really well. Out of nowhere she messages me and says “I’m not sure how this app works, do we just meet to have sex or do we go on a date first?” I was drinking coffee at the time and promptly shot it out both nostrils. My chance had come. I replied back that people generally just meet up to go to the Bone Zone together but I’m easy either way. She replies “well good because I hate formalities” I nearly shit my pants in excitement. She sends me her address and tells me she’s free on Friday and to bring wine. The rest of that whole week was a complete blur of anxiety. I could not fuck this up. 

So Friday comes, I show up with wine, she looks fucking smoking hot. Better in person. We talk about music and travelling and all that, not many personal details (which would come back to haunt me) just sort of arts & culture talk. A few glasses of wine later and were full blown going at it like rabbits on the middle of her living room floor. I left a little while later feeling like I’m the king of the entire universe and go to sleep. 

The next day she texts me saying how she had a great time, and it made her feel young again and blah blah blah. She says she’s off every Friday and Saturday and that next week we should do the same. 

This has been going on for roughly 3 months, we meet up once or twice a week, fuck like animals, and then go on our merry way until one of us gets horny again. Sweet deal right? Wrong. 

I messaged her yesterday saying that I had today off of work and asked if she wanted to meet up, she said her son was taking her out to lunch, and that I could come over at 3pm. She had mentioned she had a son before but didn’t go any further and I didn’t really care to ask.

So 3pm comes and I’m almost at her house when she messages me that she’s running late; no problem. I park on the road and sort of just wait in my car because her car wasn’t in the driveway yet. I’m sitting there listening to the radio when an oddly familiar SUV pulls into the drive. I sorta looked at it funny and then I immediately realized where I knew it from. My coworker(M23) jumps out of the front seat, goes around to her side of the vehicle, gives her a kiss on the cheek and a hug and then jumps back in the car. My jaw was on the ground. 

He reversed out of the driveway and stupid me is sitting like a deer in the headlights in plain sight. He turns around and is literally 10 feet in front of my car and staring directly at me. My face goes bright red and I feel like I’m going to vomit. Me and this guy work together every single day and I consider him a friend of mine, I even trained him when he started at my company. And the kicker is I’ve been telling him (in detail) about this older lady and he’s been giving me immense kudos about it saying that it’s “his dream”.

He pulls up beside me and looks very confused, asks me what I’m doing and how funny it was we ran into each other. I panic completely and stumble over my words and pretend like I’m on the wrong street and trying to find my cousins house. He looked skeptical but sort of shrugged it off. The whole time his mother is standing there watching us through the curtains. He directs me where to go and I pull off and then circle back once he’s gone. 

Needless to say I went inside and told her what was up, and we both sort of sat there in silence before I left. No boom boom today. 

I am now panicking, there’s no way he’s not going to know right? And he’s gonna realize all these wild escapades with this she devil night mistress I’ve been telling him about is actually his mom? Fuck. I already called in sick for work tomorrow because I cannot look him in the eye. 

Will update if anything happens. 

Pray for my soul Reddit. 

UPDATE: she just texted me and says that we should tell him and come clean because it’s the right thing to do. WHAT THE FUCK. How do I politely explain that I’ve told her son in detail about our escapades including the time I dripped candle wax on her butthole? (she a freak) 

UPDATE 2: she’s adamant about telling him, even after I informed her about the explicit details I’ve been sharing since we started doing this. What is wrong w this woman. I’m seriously debating quitting my job, I know her son well and he’s gonna want to fucking kill me. She keeps insisting that “he’s a grown up and he should realize that his mother is a person too with desires like any other person” THATS NOT THE POINTTTTTT. Fuck. I’m fucked bro’s. 

UPDATE 3: she said regardless of what I say she’s telling him tomorrow, because she can’t “live with the guilt and deceit” she won’t answer my calls at all. Not going over to her house because she’s out somewhere. I’m fucked, will update again. Let my tombstone read “died doing what he loved best”. 

UPDATE 4: Well gentleman, the cat is out of the bag. His mother pulled the trigger and came clean about it all. I don’t even know what to say. He called me saying it was super weird and he’s mindfucked but he’s not mad because he knows we had no idea. He asked if it was her I’d been talking about the whole time and I said yes, then he must’ve felt suicidal because he asked “....even all that crazy stuff?” RIP BRO. Needless to say I laughed and changed the subject, you’ve been through enough today my child. 

He also said he’s gonna look for a new job & already gave his two weeks notice because it’ll be weird working together. Damn. He genuinely just seems bummed as fuck. His mother is an idiot and I feel scummy as hell. He also said he put in a transfer so we won’t be working in the same building until he’s gone. Jeez. Going to see his Mom later and telling her we can’t do this anymore, she caused him to lose a job and a friend and a reason to go to therapy over something we could’ve likely played off. I think that’s the end of it though, didn’t expect this to blow up so big but thanks for all the awards and comments! At least someone gained something positive from this rollercoaster haha. 

Can’t believe I made my own son quit his job. Damn. 

Thanks Reddit! 

TLDR; banging hot older woman for a few months, go to meet with her. Coworker drops her off and I learn that she’s his mother. He sees me waiting and seems skeptical about my lie as to what I was doing. My world crushes. RIP Me.

tifu,TIFU By agreeing to an “open relationship”,"Obviously a throwaway. 

To put things into perspective, I (M 20) and my GF (F 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. Typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

We decide to spice things up a bit and “open” up our relationship a little. It was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole “sex is fun” idea.

She is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she’s met a guy (M 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn’t working at the time. I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

The week after, she mentions she’s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn’t expecting it but I’m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn’t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she’s just having a good time?

The next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a “break” from “everything” right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we’re over. She’s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she’s with him. I’ve heard from her friends that they’re dating now. 

TLDR; Agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU after getting high with my fianceé,"Last night I finally managed to convince my fianceé to smoke weed with me. She's always been anti-420, but now that we're just a few weeks away from getting married and being all grown up and shit, she's gone full YOLO. 

Fast forward to me seeing my fianceé high for the first time. She became extremely relaxed and talkative. It was cute at first, listening to her go on and on about life and love. But then shit kind of got specific. She mentioned how she never expected to be with someone like me. 

I didn't even have to encourage her to explain because the floodgates were already wide open. All those details spilled out without any fucking filter. This is what I learned from my fianceé that I never knew before: 

1. Most of her past relationships ended because she was notoriously promiscuous.

2. As per #1: one of those relationships came to an end after she cheated on her boyfriend by hooking up with his younger brother, while also cheating on the damn brother, with his best friend, who just so happened to be the same sex.

3. I'm the first guy she's had to do the ""fake orgasm thing"" with. Apparently all her exes pushed all the right buttons whereas I don't.

4. My asthma is a turn off when it comes to sex because she feels like she needs to hold back, so that I don't get too excited and die.

5. All her exes had horse dicks (of course they did!). I'm her first average.

Those were some of the key points. I was too traumatised to register whatever else she said afterwards. I don't think I blinked for the rest of the evening.

**TL:DR Convinced my fianceé to get high on relationship-destroying weed.**

*Update: Even though I knew what my fianceé said would haunt me forever, I was willing to bury it in the back of my mind and pretend like last night never even happened. However, my fianceé wanted to talk. So we did. It was brutal. She said my mom was right about her being wrong for me. Long story short, all of this shit was building up to her admitting she'd been sending nudes to one of her horse dick exes. A fucking Chad. I'm emotionally destroyed. It doesn't feel real yet, so I have trouble accepting it's over. But it is. Guess I'm returning that ring and getting a PS5. Appreciate all the advice.*",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by giving my son permission to beat his bully’s ass.,"My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn’t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn’t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn’t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully’s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he’s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

EDIT THREE: Thanks for the precious metals! And holy shit! Front page?!?!",Entertainment

tifu,TIFU by sending nudes to my employee group chat.,"TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my “intentions” where with the video and that he’s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


TLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

tifu,TIFU by obliterating my wife's fish.,"Happened last night.

Wife's 8 year old very large goldfish was passing away.  Had dropsy, was suffering, and was on the verge of death.   Wife and I looked into the symptoms and there was practically no hope of him making a recovery, so she asked me to euthanize him.  Looking into methods, it seemed pretty agreed upon that the most effective and quick way to euthanize a fish was blunt force trauma.

Now, when I was a kid my family were huge anglers, and I was designated as the fish killer when it was time to cook them.  Back then, I was told to slam them on the ground as hard as I could.  Well, my 8 year old body wasnt strong enough to kill them instantaneously so I had to do it multiple times.  Honestly it kind of fucked me up a little.

Flash forward to last night, I didn't want that happening again and I wanted it to be painless.  I asked my wife to leave the room because she was very upset and I chose to do the deed by putting the fish in a plastic grocery bag and slamming it on the counter as hard as I possibly could.

The poor fish was absolutely obliterated.  The force ripped open the bag and sprayed bits of what used to be a goldfish in every direction.  Told my wife to stay upstairs and she started getting suspicious so she comes down after 5 minutes and its just everywhere still.  On the counter, on the stove, on the fridge, on the freaking Christmas tree we still have up, I was still finding pieces of it this morning.  Wife was aghast and traumatized.  Cried until she went to bed.

TL;DR I euthanized my wife's dying fish quickly but in the most visually traumatizing way possible.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by thinking my laser hair removal nurse was complimenting my asshole,"Obligatory this happened a couple of days ago but I’ve only just psychologically recovered from my utter embarrassment.

So. After lockdown ended in my country there’s been a huge sale at my local laser hair removal clinic and so I thought fuck it, I might as well go for it.
So I paid for my 10 visits and set off for the first one, a little nervous but excited for my new, hairless body. Now I decided it would be a great idea to get a full Brazilian, allll the way from front to back. Pretty normal right?

The lovely nurse comes in and gives me a brief heads up, explains how it all works sorta thing. So she leaves the room, leaving me to strip down. She comes back in, and decides that we are going to laser away the hair around my asshole first. All well and good right?

So the instructions I’m given are “lay on your right side, and use your left hand to pull up your bum cheek”

So here I am, lying on my side, hand pulling up my bum while this lady sticks a laser round my asshole. Now, on my left hand, I wear this gorgeous silver ring with a bright blue gem- it was handmade by my best friends boyfriend so it’s pretty unique.

So this lady saw my gorgeous ring, and decided to break the awkward silence with a “that’s a cute ring you have there”.

And of course, I happened to forget I was wearing the damn ring. It just made sense in my head that this nurse was complimenting the ring of my asshole. Yeah. I know.

So, still on my side, I tell her “thank you! It’ll be a lot nicer when it’s hairless lol”

Cue awkward laugh and then silence, until I realised that she was not, in fact, talking about my bum. Finished the rest of the appointment without speaking and dashed out of there as soon as possible. Still recovering.

TL;DR: my laser hair removal complimented my ring on my finger while doing laser hair removal on my asshole, and I thought she was saying I had a cute asshole

Edit: clarity

Edit: for everyone asking, this is the [ring](https://imgur.com/uqhSqij). It’s not super intricate but I was more impressed that it was handmade and the stone is pretty imo.
For everyone asking, my friends boyfriend has started a jewellery business and I bought the ring to support them- nothing funny going on there.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by Complimenting a Girl’s Skirt,"Happened a couple weeks ago

I was at a party and saw a girl across the room. She was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. I saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. A lot of women I know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.

A bit later, I got around to talking to her. I complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. She looked very confused, said “my skirt doesn’t have pockets, why would you think that?” I mentioned that I had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. Her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. What I thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.

I apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she’d never heard that comment before. I’m still dying inside though.

TL DR; Complimented a girl on having a skirt with pockets, turns out she just didn’t have a hand.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by forgetting to log out of reddit,"TIFU by saving my reddit log in to the computer at my work.

In fact, I don't even know I've FU yet. My co-worker is hoping that I discover that I FU when I receive replies to this post. Reddit, please let me know I've FU and give my coworker recommendations of how to increase the consequences of staying logged in.

tifu,TIFU by giving my dog unintentionally the best damn day of his life,"So this TIFU isn't as crazy or wild as others I read, but I thought others would appreciate how much I'm laughing but how many horrible regrets I have over this situation.

Let me start by saying it's important to note that whenever I cook hotdogs, I slice the package, take out a few, roll the rest back up in the plastic packaging, and fasten it all with some good old fashion elastic bands.

.. Today. I did not. 

I couldn't tell you why my dumb ass decided to just fold the plastic over a few times and place it back on the shelf, but here we are.

So my spouse comes running down in their few minutes between endless meetings to make their lunch quickly. We are the only two in our house, plus our little rescue dog who was a stray and an absolute MOOCH.

I mean, this dog will weave between your feet, eyes GLUED to the floor hoping for even a single speck of crum because woe is him he's never been fed a day in his life.

So we're all in the kitchen, I hear the fridge open, and it suddenly dawns on me in horror that my spouse is MOST DEFINITELY going to go for those hotdogs I wrapped like a dumbass.

I quickly turn around to say something, and my spouse in slow motion, wide-eyed stares at me as the hotdog package unrolls like a fruit-by-the-foot commerical and DOUSES my dog's entire skull in too-much-to-be-reasonable-in-one-fucking-package of hotdog water.

My dog lost his SHIT.

Like a Christian grandma with the second coming of Christ my dog just tears ass across the entire apartment with the worst case of the zoomies I think we've ever seen him have.

He proceeds to spend the next 15 mins singing our praises as the greatest humans alive as he rolls across every piece of furniture we own.

I'm talking every. Piece. Of. Furniture.

Now I don't hate hotdogs but the smell is weirdly  overpowering, and every time I sat down on something else all I can smell is godforsaken hotdogs.

My dog loves it though. And now I'm figuring out how to shampoo out hotdog water from my life. I have so many regrets.

TLDR: My dumb ass didn't seal a package of hotdogs properly and my spouse accidentally dumped hotdog water all over my dog's head and now I'm living in a hotdog smelling hellhole because my dog decided to excitedly roll on EVERYTHING we own. But at least he's having the best damn day of his life because of it. I probably hate hotdogs now.

Edit: Oh my gosh I'm trying to go through all the comments! I'm so glad so many of you got a good laugh out of this too! I don't know what awards do, but I want to thank you kind folks for being so cool. <3

Edit 2: I didn't know how to add the doggo tax so I posted pics in the comments!",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home,"My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

So, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

TL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by leaving my reddit account logged in on the shared work computer and allowing my smarter and more handsome colleague to post whatever he wants,"Not to much to say, really. My girlfriend came to visit and I guess I got distracted. My colleague who is, as mentioned in title, much smarter and more handsome than I am, seized this opportunity with gusto. He realized the shared computer was already logged in to reddit and immediately checked the username.

""Ahh... Justifire989, you have fucked up."" Immediately he knew where he should post first. Unfortunately, I am a lesser man and not subscribed to [r/TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/TIFU/), so he must have had to navigate here before beginning his tirade.

How he must have cackled, laughing at my puny karma score. Nearly 5 years on reddit and all I've amassed is 485 measly internet points. I imagine he must have checked all my posts and perhaps even read some of my comments. I started to worry... ""Wait...! Have I posted anything embarrassing?!"" As soon as this thought occurred to me I, of course, went to check my comment history, hoping I hadn't commented on anything in [r/furry\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/).

It was then that I began to wonder what else he may have done to my account while I was gone. Upon inspection, I found that he had subscribed to several subreddits I never would have subbed to. Who knew that [r/sounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/sounding/) is a thing? NSFW WARNING

Now I must begin the process of cleaning up my account. Or perhaps I'll simply discard it and start fresh. I just can't believe that I was dumb enough to let this happen while I was in sitting in the next room. Pray for me reddit, I've been bested by a better man.

TL;DR left my account signed in, colleague messed with me

UPDATE: My shift is over now so I'm headed out. OP called me a few minutes ago to say ""Well played."" when he started getting notifications on his phone from r/gayr4r. I feel I've done good work this night.

UPDATE 2: The first update and the post itself was made by my colleague, not the owner of the account. I see a few people are upset by the post that was made in r/gayr4r, but i assure you it was not made with any malicious intent nor was it made by me. Huge thanks to all the people who have given awards btw! I will make sure my colleague is provided with the satisfaction of knowing they did good.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by getting my Bestfriend pregnant,"Probably my biggest fuck up ever, which will haunt me for the next 18 years.
Just feels so surreal, not necessarily panicking tho. I'm 23M and my female friend, whom I've known for the most part of my life is currently 22. 
I still remember us playing every day as little kids to hanging out almost everyday as teenagers, we often went on vacation together either with my or her parents. 
She was sort of like the sister I never had, and people now hearing that I got her pregnant feels almost like it's illegal. 

A few months ago, I was at her apartment both of us super drunk, and  yeah it somehow just happened. 
It was good, so I guess in the following weeks it accidentally happened quite often🤷🏽‍♂️.
We did use condoms , but she isn't on birthcontrol.
How the hell did she get pregnant. 
I know that there are a few, who even get pregnant on birthcontrol, but never thought it would happen to   us.
 She took 5 pregnancy tests and 1 week later went to the gynecologist, who comfirmed.
We both can't bring it on ourselves to abort the baby, so we're keeping it, we're financially stable so I don't think it would be a problem.

We're planning on telling our parents this evening, so akward since they've seen me grow up with her etc. The only one who's been shipping us since day one, was her grandma lol
. Still can't believe I'll have to spent 18 years of my life ,well it's not even 18 years it's a life commitment lol.

TL:DR Got my childhood friend🤰🏾🤰🏾

For those of you suggesting me to get a partenity test. : 
Yes she even told me she doesn't mind if I'm doubting that the child is mine, since the scenario is somehow unlikely. She told me she didn't sleep with another guy for the last 2 months. 
I'll be taking a paternity test, but I'm already 99% sure that child is mine.

*UPDATE*

Ok guys, I just went with her to her parents house, we actually wanted to go in the evening as I said, but the sooner the better I guess. 
I was really nervous ,her dad was working in the garden and her mom was cleaning around the house. After thirty minutes, everyone was gathered in the kitchen, so we thought a better opportunity wouldn't come. We told them and I could see the horror in their eyes lol. 

Idk they seemed kinda happy, but also shocked.
 Her mom started tearing up, so I guess she's either happy or disappointed.
 Her dad asked why we didn't tell them that we're ,,dating"" and my god that was such an akward moment because both of us didn't reply, (akward silence). 

They were asking a bunch of questions, and we even called her grandma telling her that her prediction was right. We made up an excuse and left, later on in the car she gave me a kiss and told me that she was proud of me, the whole drive her hand was resting on my thigh.
 Like does that mean she likes me?? I don't want to misinterpret anything to make things even worse. She's a very very kind person in general, so a bunch of guys always thought she liked them meanwhile she was only being nice.



Final UPDATE:

Okay Guys that'll be my final update, maybe if I remember I'll update in 9 months let's see. 

I discussed everything with her that needed to be discussed. We're planning on moving together when she's 6-7months pregnant, and we'll just see how it works. We both admitted to having feelings for eachother, so we'll just see were it goes, and leave our relationship how it is bestfriends, who live together and fuck I guess. 

Thanks for all the encouragment, this post shouldn't even be on TIFU anymore lol. I'm kinda excited on being a father.

And btw she's reading the comments......

*To clarify, apparently a few didn't get it,yes we are dating*

Bestfriend+ fuck= Dating




UPDATE:

Hey Guys, It‘s been awhile.

Almost forgot about this post. I‘ve received alot of nice messages, unfortunately I couldn‘t reply to all of them, since it were alot.

Anyways here is the Update, can‘t lie but those months were definetly more stressful and complicated than I expected them to be, considering Us being so young , nontheless it was all worth it the first time I held my little baby girl in my arms.

We didn‘t know the gender of our baby, since we wanted it to be a surprise.  When it comes to gender I don‘t necesseraly have a preference, but I‘d be lying if I said I never wanted to be a girl dad .

And for anyone wondering if she‘s my child , Yes she is haha, she even inherited  a family illness of mine (not saying that‘s good)

So I think the question most of you want answered is, what happened between me and my bestfriend ?

Well we did move in together , which was definetly a financial burden for us, and money in some months is really  tight, since we pay everything out of our own pocket. (I don‘t really like the idea of using our parents money, even if this would help us alot)

I found it sort of funny how people were actually believing that I was this oblivious, which I actually wasn‘t haha. Well maybe a bit, realizing she has been dropping hints, since we were like 16 .

But yeah there isn‘t much to Update, I feel like I mainly highlighted the negative consequences , but it‘s honestly pretty awesome too. 
The best feeling is to find a Bestfriend in a Lover, and I couldn‘t imagine loving anyone as much as I love her. 


That‘s it have a nice day :)",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU by misunderstanding a text from my wife, thinking my kid had thrown up, and missing out on sex","This wasn't today, it was actually Sunday.

The other night my wife and I were getting ready for bed and being kind of flirty. I had to use the restroom, so stayed downstairs while she went up to bed. While I was sitting on the toilet I got a text: ""Bring a bucket and a mop.""

Crap, one of my kids must have thrown up. I finished my toilet biz and went down to the basement to check the cleaning supplies. I found a bucket, but couldn't find a mop. i found one of those squeezy sponge things, but the sponge was missing. Figuring the vomit was probably congealing by this point, I just grabbed the bucket and a bunch of paper towels and ran upstairs.

I got to the upstairs bathroom and found no mess. I carried the cleaning supplies down to my kids rooms, but found no vomit. I went to our bedroom and found my wife lying on the bed. She asked what had taken me so long, and I said I couldn't find a mop, and where was the mess?

She started rolling around on the bed laughing. Suddenly I realized ""Bring a bucket and a mop"" was a line from ""WAP (Wet Ass Pussy)."" My wife had been in the mood, and I had spent 15 minutes looking for a mop in the basement. 

She was laughing so much that the mood was basically dead. 

TL;DR: My wife texted me a line from a Cardi B song to tell me she was in the mood. I thought she wanted me to bring cleaning supplies because a kid threw up.",Entertainment
tifu,Tifu by showing my family a short video of me fingering my girlfriend.,"Edit: Extemporaneous typing.

TL;DR: watch the Apple memories of 2020 videos by yourself first. 

This happened about 45 minutes ago.

So... anyone that has an Apple device may have noticed they do these “memory videos” for 2020. Anyways, I had just discovered this feature and was watching it with my girlfriend. Slowly, other immediate family members joined around us after having heard the “chill” music played along the montage.

We saw some cute pictures of our pets, museums visits pre-COVID, my GF and I spotting deer, us decorating our new apartment, time spent at my moms house, visits to forest preserves, and other no contact activities we did this summer and fall.

Then it happened. About 3 minutes into the montage it shifted from a picture to a short clip of me sliding 2 fingers into my girlfriends vagina. Time froze. Someone said, “Oh my” in the tone of an antebellum age southern lady, and I whipped my phone down. People walked away, but a proverbial fly on the wall would have collided with the amount tensions in the air, which would require more than a knife to cut.

I’m now home laying in bed typing this and thinking about how 30 years from now, this is going to be one of those embarrassing memories that keep me up at night.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by sleeping with a married woman.,"So, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I’m probably going to be murdered.

I’m at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it’s over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I’m just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me 

“hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?”

 “Uhh what?”

 “Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me” 

to which the bartender said “oh you can trust Greg, he’s really nice”. Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

Girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical ‘meet a girl at a bar’ flirting shit. She asks if I’ve ever seen the show Years and Years. I say “no, but I’ve seen the band perform live”. So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. “Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT”. So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said

 “hey do you live close by?” 

“Yea, like half a mile”

 “we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car”

“Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now”

“That’s okay, I have pets too” (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

“I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow”

“That’s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I’ll have to go home”
“That’s fine” heh, cuz that’s all the time I’ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It’s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I’ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say “oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!” Which I’m excited about, because at this point I’m thinking to myself “hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid”

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn’t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to “watch HBOGO”.

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It’s fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an “oh no” thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I’ve slept with some strange in my time. I don’t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I’m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn’t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we’re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We’re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say “that was great we should do this again sometime”

“I don’t think so”

“What why?”

“I don’t think my husband would appreciate that”



I am speechless. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I’m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: “Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you’re at? Like, why didn’t you tell me that?”

Her: “idk, does it matter?”

“Uh yeah, I’d be pretty pissed if I was him”


Now I’ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I’ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn’t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn’t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don’t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: “we’re getting separated soon”

Me: “well you’re still fucking married to him”

“Yea but that’s okay”

“How is that okay?”

“He’s been..... abusive”


There’s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She’s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I’m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me “(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy” Btw, Evan Williams isn’t that bad when you’re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn’t like morning sex. I’m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can’t because she didn’t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn’t move it because “I didn’t know how to drive it” 

“Uhh, this is the third time we’ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car”

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she’ll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I’m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn’t think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That’s the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I’m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She’s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she’d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I’m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says “make it quick”

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I’m just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we’re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I’m like 

“I’ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on”
“No”

“What do you mean ‘no’? You can’t get in an Uber with your pussy out”

“No”


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That “arch” thing that women do when you’re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She’s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I’m starting to panic myself. Because I don’t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that’s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it’s her sending multiple texts saying “I’m so sorry babe” “idk where I’m at” “come get me”. And him saying “nope sorry” “this is on you” and “call 911”

That last one though. That’s what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I’m starting to worry about my safety. I don’t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that “you don’t know how to drive my car” with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn’t answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, “girl you need to get dressed, you’re gonna be going home”

Finally got her panties back on, I didn’t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can’t force her to go anywhere she didn’t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She’s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I’m like “I guess?”, and then I let them in.

She yells “are you fucking serious? You called the cops?” 
“Uh yea, you didn’t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that’s what I did”

The officer said to her “you’re on this man’s property, and he wants you to leave”

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what’s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn’t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer’s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she’s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. “I don’t think they’ll let you take that”

Cops didn’t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say “usually this is the other way around, ha”

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it’s over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she’s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn’t able to check. But I’m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven’t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I’m glad I could share this story with y’all. There might be more to come, but you’ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

Jk don’t do that.

And don’t stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house.

Edit: I’m not gonna change “que” to “cue” because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.

Edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa

Edit 3: her car is still there. Can’t get it towed, because it’s on a public street. I’m still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I’ll get to them when I can.

Edit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.

Edit 5: I’m still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor’s house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it’s front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she’s most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her “hey do you wanna get this car that’s in front of your house towed?” She said “no, noooo hehe” I’m like “yea, I’ll talk to y’all tomorrow” just wtf.

**UPDATE**

I’ve been texting a mutual friend of the couple. Apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. I’m in the works of a TIFUpdate. But I’ll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. I’d like to protect the privacy of those involved, but I’m just too lazy to do it right now.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.,"Our friends fighting for net neutrality contacted us to ask if we would once more make a stickied post about this topic. Since net neutrality is important for everyone who wants to keep enjoying a free internet - a group to which  most redditors belong - the mod team has decided to allow it:

---------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.

Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.

We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

tifu,TIFU by making my Dad punch a stripper in GTA and tearfully ask God for forgiveness in front of my entire family.,"I was encouraged to post this here from a comment I made elsewhere, even though it didn’t happen today, or even this decade, so mods please remove if it goes against the rules. It’s a very funny story though.


When I was young, my brothers and I snuck a copy of San Andreas into the house. We spent days holed up in our basement taking turns playing, and down there my parents didn’t bother us too much. In order to get tons of money for guns (we had yet to figure out my parents’ dialup password so cheats weren’t a thing for us yet), we would go to the strip club and stand on the stage, absorbing the money dudes threw at the women and just let the game sit for 10-20 minutes. We had to be careful though because sometimes the strippers would do a move and bump into CJ and the bouncers would shoot the place up. One day while I was playing my mom yelled down to the basement at us to get ready, we’re going to Pizza Hut. In a stroke of genius, I drove to the GTA strip club, got on the stage, and then turned the TV off and we left. It was to be the heist of the century.

My dad, however, was at church at this time, practicing for a gospel concert he was singing in. He always filmed the practices so he could take notes at home upon playback, and this time was no different. While my mom and brothers and I were still at the Hut, he arrived at home and plugged his camcorder into the VCR. We had just one VCR, and it was connected to the basement TV.

Back at the Hut, my mom gets a phone call. She puts her napkin down and slowly looks around the table at us and says ‘ooookay’ a few times into the phone in this really calculating, specific way that she always did when she knew us kids were in trouble before we did. Naturally, it was at this point that we kids knew we were in trouble. For what, though, we didn’t know.

After a very quiet minivan ride, we get home and my mom says “Boys why don’t we go down to the basement. Your dad wants to show you his gospel practice downstairs.” It was then at THIS point we knew why we were in trouble. So we drag our feet down the stairs, and lo and behold, my dad is sitting on the couch, TV on, a stripper’s polygonal titties swung stiffly back and forth onscreen to En Vogue’s “My Lovin’”, with CJ standing mere inches away, collecting money.

My dad starts in, “boys I don’t even know where to begin. This PlayStation was a blessing to you for Christmas and this is how you repay us? By breaking our trust??” He is holding the controller up now, gesticulating with it. “Here I am, practicing to bring glory to God, and-“ but he was cut off, as he inadvertently squeezed the controller, causing CJ to punch the stripper.

My entire family stands in silence, watching together as the bouncers in the strip club shoot the place up for what seems like an eternity. After the shooting stops, and CJ appears in front of the hospital, I look back and see my mom silently weeping into her hand. I look at my dad as a single tear rolls down his cheek and he prays under his breath. After another eternity of silence, without a word, my dad bends down, disconnects the PlayStation, walks back to the family computer, disconnects it, goes to his car and drives away. For the next four months he kept the PS2 and PC locked in his office at work.

It’s one of my favorite memories of growing up. I miss my brothers.

TL;DR: Wasn’t allowed to play GTA growing up, of course got caught playing it, my dad interrupted his own lecture by accidentally punching a stripper and immediately asked for God’s forgiveness.


EDIT: Thanks so much for the response, I’m glad I could spread some laughs with this story! I just want to clarify that my parents weren’t crazy at all, so no need to insult them. I love them so much, they just got overzealous and dramatic from time to time. I had a really great childhood with two loving and involved parents who tried really, really hard to live and raise our family by their convictions. It just doesn’t always work out for everyone involved, like in this case, but it made for a great story that we can all laugh about now. I’m very much an atheist and my parents know it, but we still get along great :)

EDIT 2: Also my brothers aren’t dead, we’re all just spread out across the country now! I don’t get to see them very much anymore, that’s all!

EDIT 3: Alright now I’m not being so nice. I’m an atheist, but all you other atheist weirdos calling my parents crazy are weird. I hesitate to inform people I’m atheist because of houseplants like you. So self-informed on my life because you’re drunk on your own over-inflated, homuncular ideas about spirituality in people’s personal lives, it’s no wonder r/atheism isn’t a default sub anymore. Look how you’re acting, trying to tell me “bro you need to get out of there.” The story is over a decade old, apparently none of you can read! I shouldn’t be surprised at what I’m reading! However, if you do still feel inclined to let the pea that rolls around your empty head, whose sound you mistake for a competent thought, inform you of some truly transcendent comment in which you consider calling my parents whack jobs and nuts, it says way more about you and your small-mindedness in acting like you know better just because you have an internet connection and a lifetime full of trauma on your own.

tifu,TIFU by showing my mom a drawing of my sleep paralysis visitor,"I get sleep paralysis. I have for the past few years off and on. Usually every couple of months I’ll get a sleep paralysis dream. I’ve talked to my parents about it before. The fuck up is not that they know.

The fuck up is that I decided to try drawing what I saw over my bed last night. And then sent a picture to my mom.

Now, my parents are hella catholic. Like, homeschooled for 6 years and went to church every day catholic. Like, when things go bad in life my dad wholeheartedly believes it’s the devil actively attacking us so we lose our faith. Which explains their reaction when I showed them [this picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/NPknvMj).

Cue the panicked phone call from my parents who now believe the devil visits me in my sleep. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with them trying to find a bible or a rosary so my mom could sleep without worrying my soul would be stolen. They want me to talk to a priest and get my house blessed and use holy water every time I enter. The next time I visit them, I may end up in an impromptu exorcism. Wish me luck.

tifu,TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

*Edit*

Wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*Edit 2*

I don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names 

*Edit 3.0*

Ok it's been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*Edit 4.0*

Uhh this post is getting deleted. It's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*Edit 5*

Final edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.

Thanks for everyone who said I'm not the asshole. I may have autism, but I'm not an asshole.

tifu,TIFU by making such a disgusting smell from my butt it evacuated a courtroom.,"So this happened about 5 hours ago.

So today I woke up and had really painful cramps due to the deadly woman’s monthly cycle, mixed with some spiced chicken that hadn’t set right in my belly all night. I go to the toilet about 3 times before work this morning but it’s eased off a bit so take tablets, grin and bear it then leave for work. 

Now my job is a working within the Prison System and escorting prisoners to certain places, including courts. This is where it all went downhill. 

I had to escort this prisoner over to the witness box and stand next to her (open court) So I do my usual but my tummy has started to really hurt again. I’m trying my absolute best to put off a fart which I know is brewing but can’t hold it much longer. So I do a really silent one and pat myself on the back thinking I had got away with it....

That is until the Prisoner starts coughing and retching and shouting, ‘what the fucks that?!’  I quickly realise what it must be but can’t admit to such a foul, putrid smell so start crinkling my nose as well and gagging. The admin clerk walks slightly closer and retches so hard she had to swiftly put her head in the bin. By this point it’s getting loud and chaos is starting to ensue (not what you want in court, in front of the District Judge) 

He quickly tells me to take the prisoner back over to the closed dock and states it must be the pipes. He stands down the whole of court and makes maintenance come in to check all pipes for any leaks, cracks, ANYTHING which could of made that smell happen.  Prisoner still has watery eyes, Im pretending to gag and the clerk is sipping water next to a bucket. 

TLDR: So yeah, court was stood down for over an hour whilst it was searched for the cause of a smell. Not knowing the cause was back down in the cells, hanging her head in shame and regaling to her co-workers about the ‘leaky pipe’ upstairs.",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU Update: I fucked up by not knowing the guy I like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass.""","Link to OG post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

Well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).

tifu,TIFU - I accidentally revealed my boyfriend's mom's infidelity,"Obligatory this story actually happened about a year ago: I (18F at the time) was dating a boy named, Jacob (18 M at the time). His father (early 60s) was a mechanic, and his mom (mid 50s) was a SAHM. They were a pretty typical white suburban family in the south and had asked Jacob if they could meet me even though we had only been dating for a month.

At the dinner, I met his mom, dad, older brother, older sister, and her newborn daughter. The dinner went well and I was chatting about my volunteer work at my college's blood drive, to which his father explains that his doctor told him he was O negative and a universal blood donor. My boyfriend mentions he is also O, but his siblings casually mention they are both AB. I don't think anything of it because my bf had mentioned that his mom was married once before and was widowed. The following conversation went like this:

Me: Oh that's really cool. You're a really rare blood type. If you don't mind me asking: is your mom's blood type A and your dad's B or your dad's A and mom's B?

OS (older sister): What do you mean? He's O. \*Gesturing to my bf's father\*

Me: Oh I know. I was just asking about your bio father, but of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

\*I notice his mom get really pale, and it was in that moment I realized I fucked up\*

OB (older brother): What do you mean bio father?

Me: I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

\*Jacob's dad got real quiet and looking at his wife's face. He knew instantly. I look over to Jacob who I think was starting to put the full picture of what was happening together\*

Jacob's dad: Are you saying they're not my biological kids? Because my wife swore up and down in marriage counseling (By ""Marriage Counseling"" they mean with a pastor) that they were my kids and she would never cheat on me. (yeah... turns out she never had any kids from her previous marriage)

Jacob's Mom: I would never cheat on you. OS and OB are your kids.

Jacob's Dad: OP, why do you think they're not my kids?

I tried to excuse myself because it was very clear the cat was out of the bag, and with a quick google search from my boyfriend he starts cussing out his mom. She starts to sob and apologizes over and over again. And I am forced to explain 9th-grade biology to his father about the fact that the only kids he could have produced were with the blood type: O, A or, B; but absolutely not AB. Jacob was the only one with the possibility of being his son.

They all start screaming at one another. OS eventually leaves because her newborn is screaming too. His mom goes and locks herself in the bedroom. His older brother follows her screaming asking who his real father is. My boyfriend is trying to figure out if his dad still wants to *be* their father. I eventually have a friend come pick me up.

Yeah... we broke up shortly after but not after figuring out that none of the kids produced from the marriage were his (Edit: They found out via paternity tests, for sure weren't his kids) and they divorced soon after.

**TL;DR I accidentally revealed that my boyfriend's mom was unfaithful by pointing out the fact that his older siblings who both had the blood type AB could not have been biologically related to their O negative father**

Edit: For those asking how they knew their blood types -- Jacob donated blood for the blood drive at our school. His sister just had a baby so she was probably informed during pregnancy. Jacob's dad was told by his doctor for (probably) underlying medical reasons I don't know (I wasn't ever really close to his family after that for obvious reasons) and I don't know how his brother knew.

Edit/PSA: Reading through the comments I have discovered many of you don't know your blood type: **Go find out your blood type! It can save your life in an emergency!** If you are parents find out your children's blood type. If you discover you are not biologically related to one or either of your parents. I am very sorry, but you should still know your blood type and I would suggest some therapy.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by not kissing a girl at a college football game on national television.,"(This happened yesterday)

Also, throwaway since I don't want IRL friends finding my account

So there's a video going around of the Wake vs. Duke football game of a girl leaning in to kiss a guy and him not returning the kiss, and looking away. It's on r/therewasanattempt, and currently on r/popular, as well as trending on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.

That guy is me.

I have gotten texts from high school friends I haven't talked to in years, random college classmates, and my sister and mom who have all seen that video, and I'm gonna take this brief moment of internet fame to explain what actually happened.

Basically, I've been talking to this girl for a while and we just started dating about a week ago. I tell her she should come to the Wake game since we are undefeated and will probably win. She says yes. We go with a group of friends, and we are having a great time. Throughout the game we are flirting, hugging, kissing a little bit, etc. We also do this thing where one of us leans in for a kiss, and the other person leans away, which is an inside joke between the two of us. So, we do our little inside joke thing, and unbeknownst to us, we are being recorded.

After the game, I find I'm on the wake forest old row Instagram page, and within the hour I'm on the official old row page. Then, I'm on TikTok, Twitter, and apparently Reddit too.

Just to clarify a few things:

1. She did not get rejected, we were just playing around
2. We did not know we were being recorded
3. If you want proof, check our TikTok accounts (hhhhggggllll and sandx.lop)
4. It was also her first (maybe last?) college football game

Anyway, the internet is full of horrible people and I haven't done any work this weekend, so I'm gonna go do that now. Peace

TL;DR I didn't kiss a girl at a football game and now I'm paying the price.

tifu,TIFU by genuinely forgetting I had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in Amsterdam and getting caught.,"So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

I would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

Came with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It’s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

I’m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit ‘coffee shops’ and buy and smoke joints. 

Had a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

In a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...’did I ditch that joint’?

At this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

‘Sir, do you have anything in your pockets’ says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I’m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

Go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I’m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I’m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

‘Sir, empty your pocket please’? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

I’m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, ‘oh god. I’m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...’
‘HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY’! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

I’m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

Customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, ‘Don’t worry Sir! Don’t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won’t be last! I’m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can’t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home’. 

I almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he’d taken joint off me....and that was it...

I’m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You’re the best. I’m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

TLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. 

Edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

Edit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I’m from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I’ve just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, ‘joints’. 

Edit 3-Schiphol doesn’t frisk as matter of routine, yes I get it. Thanks for correction.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by sending a call from the International Space Station to voicemail,"This happened two days ago (Sunday). A friend of mine is currently on his second mission to the ISS. I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said “Us Gov.” I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. “Crap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn’t?!” I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all ""Don't answer it!"" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was “You probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.” I know he’ll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.

TL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said “Us Gov” so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.

Edit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam…orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that’s a common occurrence :)",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU - Forgetting that to Americans the f-word rarely means sexual intercourse in general usage,"**UPDATE SEE BELOW**

Background: I'm an American living in Germany.

Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago.

I’ve finally made a close friend here - a neighbor and she is my conversation partner. I help her English she helps my German. She and my wife are close friends too. 

A little background, I joke around a lot and am always messing with ppl, etc. She knows this.

So, over the last year we’ve seen each other more often due to Corona and we’re able to talk more and I’m getting more comfortable being myself. 

A couple of weeks ago I said something to her in a joking manner and she took it seriously. My expectation - I followed up with, “I’m just fucking with you.” She gives me another look, a little concerned. So I said, I’m just joking. 

I leave it be, think nothing of it. 

A week later we’re talking again and she asked, “What do you mean you were fucking with me, like in your dreams?”

It’s a this point I realized that when Americans use the word “fuck” or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse. 

To Germans, it ALWAYS means sexual intercourse in all of its variants. 

I was a bit embarrassed as was she. But once I explained it, a lightbulb went on over her head and Netflix started making more sense to her.

So she's been practicing the proper use of the f-word since with me as her coach - what else am I going to do? The other day she wrote to me, ""I like fucking you."" As much as that would be nice, I had to correct her to ""I fucking like you.""

I told her she's not ready to use the word in the wild, yet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I forgot that when Americans use the word fuck or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse. Embarrassment ensues and good cultural exchange.

**UPDATE**

Not all Germans have the same level of understanding of idiomatic English. My neighbor is trying to improve her English and in the past year it has progressed far further than my German has. That said, she grew up in the 70s and 80s and learned English in gymnasium and didn't really use it except in passing for 20 years. My wife fully understands how she could have had this misunderstanding as she, herself, had a hard time when she first moved to the USA in the 1990s understanding how fuck was being used to modify everything. My neighbor is NOT stupid, so I don't appreciate that. The reason she wrote what she wrote in the text is because we were joking around and she was trying to use a variant of fuck in a sentence.

Also, to all of the Germans out there taking offense, stop. Part of story telling is to take the truth and make it more interesting, so saying things like ""To Germans it ALWAYS means..."" is a literary device to make the point POP and set the stage for what's to come next.

All stories have embellishments, this one too. But it's not all that embellished. ",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans," About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call ""Ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

We live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

I ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

One small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).

While carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!

My heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.

I probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. 

Here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

My punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

A romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?"" He said. ""That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!""

Now he's started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, ""Gotta tie this shoe!"" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

One more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

I guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

If we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

tifu,TIFU by saving a topless woman from drowning,"So this happened yesterday... my family (wife, kids and in-laws) and I had just returned from a pontoon cruise for the evening.  It was later than usual so I sent the wife up on the golf cart with the kids and in-laws to get them some dinner while I covered up the boat.  About halfway through covering up the boat, I notice someone halfway across the cove in the water all on their own and she appeared to maybe be in distress.  She wasn’t making progress swimming one way or the other and occasionally going underwater.  There were people on the opposite shoreline yelling at her but I couldn’t tell what they were saying. I yell asking if she needs help and she says yes.  I call my wife and tell her to come down on the cart, someone is in the water and needs help, I’m going in. I might need help getting the person out. I put on a life jacket and grab the throw cushion from the boat.  I swim out to the person and pass off the throw cushion.  She appears out of breath.  First thing she says to me is “I’m topless”.  I responsd with “umm ok, but are you okay?”. 
I also immediately think to myself:
1. My friends are never going to believe this
2. What is my wife going to think with a topless woman swimming to shore with me

 She then says she’s running from her boyfriend who is “messed up”.  She also asks if it’s shallow enough to touch yet.  It wasn’t going to be. I help her to the dock where my wife meets us.  She tells my wife “I’m sorry but I don’t have a shirt on”.  Again my wife just asks if she’s okay and she tells us the boyfriend story again.  Sure enough as she gets out of the water she is topless.  But she is carrying a white Tshirt that she quickly throws on. She then immediately begins running to shore.  At the same time we notice a pontoon cruising towards our dock yelling at us.  At first I think this must be her boyfriend chasing her and we are in the middle of some domestic dispute.  They quickly get closer and I realize it’s two sheriff deputies who flagged a pontoon down to carry them across the lake.  As they are jumping onto the dock we notice the girl had just jumped into our golf cart and was riding away on it.   Apparently she was allegedly involved in a string of burglaries and the “boyfriend” she was running away from was the cops.  I had unknowingly aided her swim across the lake to escape and she used our golf cart as getaway. The cops chased her for awhile through the night tracking her down once more but she escaped again.  We looked all day for the golf cart today with no luck.  I notified insurance if the theft around lunch. About an hour ago someone notified us through social media that it was parked behind a house in a neighborhood over.  So we recovered the cart and it seems ok.  They put more warrants out for the suspect and are still looking for her.

TLDR: thought I was saving a topless woman in distress but unknowingly aided a crook in escaping the police.",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU By Swimming in a Florida Spring. when I close my eyes, I can still hear the screams....","This was a few years ago.  Took the family to Ginnie Springs, a beautiful Florida water spot for a day of swimming and a little picnic.  So as I was swimming in the crystal clear water, watching my son floundering around in his water wings, and just having a good ol time, my son suddenly stopped, pointed at the water and said ""Look daddy, a lizard!""

I looked over and saw that no, it was NOT a lizard that was swimming over to us, it was a snake. After a quick examination, I realized that this was a Water Moccasin, and a large one at that, heading right for us!

So Yelling for my son to back away, I waded out to grab him and drag him back to shore. The snake was making a beeline for us, which is weird because most of the time they avoid human contact. I started to splash water at it, trying to slow it down enough so I could reach the shore before it got too close. 

So as I was backing up, slapping water at a poisonous snake with one hand and dragging a laughing child (who had no idea what was going on) with the other, I reached close enough to the shoreline to grab a branch that had fallen from a tree. It was long and pretty sturdy. It was perfect for what needed to be done.

So as the snake got in close, I went all caveman on it and bashed it a dozen times with the branch. It worked. The snake started to float away, dead as a doornail. I then realized that all the people swimming around in this water would not take too kindly to bumping into a four foot dead moccasin, so using the branch, I launched the snake for a stretch of woods off to my right.

Well, I guess the snake was not balanced right on the branch, and I was full of Adrenalin, so instead of the woods, the snake flew high into the air, drifting off to the right where **PLOP**. It landed square on a picnic table.  To make matters worse, it landed on a pile of shoes that a girl scout troop had left when they went wading in the water.

""Oh Crap!"" was all i could think, as I began to quickly swim across the spring to remove the snake from the table, but as I was swimming, I heard them.. the giggles and laughter of little 12 year old girls returning to get their shoes. I stopped cold. I was too late. I began to swim away, trying to hide myself as I saw the first curly haired head approach the table. There was laughing, there was chatting and talking... then there was a pause.

And that is when the screaming started.

If you have never heard a dozen 12 year old girls scream in horror as they saw a large, bloody snake draped across their shoes, I cannot even begin to explain the sound. Even as i dove underwater, I heard the screaming. 

Sometimes... at night... I still hear the screams.

TLDR- Killed a snake, launched it with a stick across a table filled with 12 year old girls shoes. the screams... they still echo in those woods to this very day.",Entertainment

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

tifu,TIFU: Telling my Dad about the Karen meme,"My family loves to over share. This lack of filter sometimes has the tendency to get people into trouble because not all the information is provided, even when it's meant harmlessly. 

My parents are a bit older (prime ""Ok, Boomer"" age). I was talking to my Dad the other day on the phone because his birthday dinner was a few days later. I asked how mom was doing and he goes on to tell me a story how my Mom and Aunt (Karen) were at the store and the cashier made a mistake. My Aunt went off on the cashier and asked to see the manager. My Mom was mortified and tried to calm her down but she wasn't having it. 

I then mentioned to my Dad, ""That's such a Karen thing."" He goes on to say ""Yeah, your Aunt does that a lot."" I tell him, ""That's the funny part, the Karen meme is a real thing. It's when an entitled (typically white) woman gets angry at the smallest mistake and asks for the manager."" 

My Dad found this hilarious and I explain in more detail. I send him a few links to sites explaining it online. He finds all of this hilarious and she even has the Karen hairstyle. This sends him down the google images rabbit hole and the next few days he sends me random meme's of ""Karens"" doing Karen stuff adding ""Your Aunt did this last week"" or ""I think this one is about your Aunt."" This leads up to his birthday dinner with extended family. 

My Dad's birthday dinner is going well. Everyone is having a good time, good food, and drinks, etc. Suddenly my Aunt (sitting a few seats down from me) leans forward and loudly shouts down the table ""Hey [my name], what's this whole thing about making a meme about me?"" I respond ""Huh?"" She then tells me my Dad sent her all these memes about things she's done. He didn't give her the context that it's a generic meme from the internet and what it's about. Now, my Aunt thinks I made all these memes about her real life events.

At this point, the entire family thinks I created this meme on the internet about my Aunt's antics in public. There is a back and forth discussion about it being really rude of me. She's pulling a Karen and starts chewing me out. Meanwhile, I am looking at my Dad like W-T-F, back me up here. My Dad finally steps in to say that this is just a random viral internet thing and that I didn't make these up behind my Aunt's back. 

Even after explaining, she's a bit irritated. It is apparent she is embarrassed that she is so much like a ""Karen"" and couldn't tell the difference between the stories online and her own encounters. 
 
TL;DR: I told my Dad about the Karen meme because my Aunt is named Karen and acts like a ""Karen."" My Dad sends my Aunt memes he found, my aunt think I made them about her, she bring it up at my Dad's birthday dinner, and pulls a Karen on me.

tifu,TIFU by pushing my girlfriend too hard.,"My girlfriend and I were laying down on our bed and watching funny videos on YouTube.

She was laughing hysterically at quite a few! So much so that it caused her to let one rip (fart) more than once.

This was obviously not intentional which made it both hilarious and adorable. After the third time it happened she said  “I’m really gassy”. I took this as an opportunity to quickly press down on her stomach which then almost immediately triggered an enormous fart.

I lost it! It was so funny and I could feel the vibration as the pressure caused her to fart again and again. I couldn’t help myself and kept doing it. 

This is how I f**ked up.

After a few successful attempts I tried for a final push. I wanted to end it on a huge one. It was so funny and she was laughing so much!!

I pushed down and nothing. So.. I pushed again but this time MUCH harder... 

Now this is where I should note that she was wearing nothing but one of my T-shirt’s. Hence she had no underwear on.

My girlfriend sharted. She sharted and then had a SEVERE follow through... all over our bed.

She was mortified. It went from pure joy to absolute chaos and horror... she was just staring at me blankly like she had just killed someone..

I didn’t know what to do as she went quiet.. my legs covered in shit..I stared right back, gently held her hands and walked together to the shower without looking back at the bed or down at my legs.. we didn’t say a word.

I cleaned up my legs before leaving her to clean herself up. She made me promise not to go into the bedroom.

I adore her completely. She looked so scared when I left her in the shower and wouldn’t let me clean up despite my offering to do so.

Eventually, I walked in the bedroom to help. She was so apologetic although I assured her that it’s completely fine.

She burst out laughing when I said to her “Don’t worry. You will always be my little shit”.

Don’t worry guys. All good! Luckily I have thick skin and can take a lot of shit ;) I adore her.

I my self don't play video games or know anything about twitch so I just said sorry and I sympathized. then I got the idea to look into it and see if maybe I can find a way to support him. I created a twitch account and started watching all of live stream and even commented a coupled of times. omg this made him so happy!! he came running into the room to tell me all about it. he has no idea its me. he now gets so excited to play and stream because he believes that even though he only has one person watching, that is one person that believes in him. COVID has been really hard on all of us and this is the first time that I have seen him this excited in like a longggg time. now I feel like there is no way I can tell him its me.

ugh I feel awful, I had good intentions and now I feel like I am hiding something from him and I am scared that he will be so disappointed to find out that this one fan was me all along.

TL;DR I tried being a supportive partner and now I am forced to keep it a secret from my s/o because of the fear of disappointing him.

tifu,TIFU by trying to tell my parents about Jeff Epstein's suicide.,"This literally just happened and I've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

I was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and I happened to see news articles that Jeffrey Epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. Now, my family and I all talk about current events and politics. My parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so I figure I'll go tell them the news.

Their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. I walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. As I hear my mom say ""Do ya mind??"", I immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. All the while trying to burn away what I just saw.

They leave for the weekend at noon, and I have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

TL;DR: Jeff Epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.

Edit: In one hour on a throwaway, I get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? Huh.

Anyway, back on the ""Fuck Jeff Epstein"" train.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by not looking before I sat down,"Floor 8 of the of place my employment, inside the mens' shitter.

&#x200B;

I'm sitting there, doing my sit-down-business because boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. I've just finished the dirty work and I'm about to perform my ablutions, but I delay it because it's a ""paid to shit"" thing, dicking around on reddit a bit. At this point I feel something jump onto my balls. Something I had never hoped I would ever experience, let alone talk about on the internet.

&#x200B;

I shriek. Not a barbarian shriek. Not a viking shriek. Psycho-Shower-Scene shriek.

&#x200B;

A huntsman spider has crawled out of the toilet bowl and jumped onto my low hanging fruit.

&#x200B;

I bat the spider off, smacking myself in the nuts, keel over in pain.

&#x200B;

Spider dead. Good news.

&#x200B;

My banshee wail has not gone unanswered. Bad news.

&#x200B;

Someone comes into the bathroom and knocks on the stall door. ""Mate are you alright? Have you fallen over? I'll call an ambulance.""

&#x200B;

""NO. FINE. EVERYTHING. IS. GOOD. JUST SLIPPED. FINE. NO NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.""

&#x200B;

I flush the world's smallest sexual predator to try and retain some of my inner pride, wash my hands, and make the very VERY long walk back to my desk.

&#x200B;

My manager's desk isn't too far from the bathrooms, and he comes up to me afterwards.

&#x200B;

""What happened in there, is everyone alright?""

&#x200B;

""Yeah... Everyone's... FINE.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And then I make the dumbest deciscion of my life, and explain to him what had happened. And the audacity of the man; he LAUGHS. He laughs so hard he has to sit down so he doesn't hurt himself.

&#x200B;

His hyena/kookaburra hybrid laughter has gotten the attention of some of the other members of my team. They're looking to get in on the funny, funny joke.

&#x200B;

Bossman wheezes ""GET... GET HIM TO... TELL THEM HOLY SHIT""

&#x200B;

And because I'm incredibly susceptible to peer pressure, I tell them. Like a fucking gimp.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna skip past most of the laughter because it went on for what felt like forever.

&#x200B;

I come back from lunch, and Bossman and two other members of my team come up to me as I'm sitting back down at my desk getting ready to get back to work. Bossman is holding a piece of paper.

&#x200B;

""Look. We need to have a chat about something. I've brought two of your friends in the team as support since this is obviously not something that's easy to talk about.""

&#x200B;

I am confused.

&#x200B;

""I have a blank HR report here. I'll need you to fill this out. You confided into me that you were sexually harassed in the workplace and it's my duty of care to make sure the 'POOPITRATOR' is brought to justice.

tifu,TIFU by slapping the absolute clot out of my girlfriend,"Girlfriend was about to take a shower, and was seriously getting her hustle on getting out of her kit. She was making proper fucking haste for the tub, and I realised that all her defences were down.

Note: in my household, bare asses are hunted down and terminated with EXTREME prejudice.

I went for the Mother of All Ass Slaps. It was completely undefended territory, and I was intending to create a masterpiece. I was aiming for that initial dull *thwack* and the resultant perfect, satisfying vibrato, complete with concentric assflesh ripples *à la* that glass of water in Jurassic Park.

I made contact, and immediately discovered the reason for her hurry.

My girlfriend was on the second day of her period.

I learned the term ‘arterial spray’ from Dexter, and have now found its southern companion. I was reeling. She was reeling. Did I say ‘Bloody Mary’ three times in the mirror before spanking dat ass? I couldn’t remember. Fortunately, its trajectory as such was so that most of the menstruation creation spattered handily in the bathtub – including The Clot: a penny-sized curd of uterine lining best visually described as Gumby’s aborted cousin.

Unfortunately, our bathmat did not escape entirely unharmed. Its cleaning was immediately and firmly relegated to ‘boyfriend work’.

By the way, has anyone seen The Thing (1982)? Good movie.

Tl;dr: slapped dat ass as my girlfriend made a beeline for the shower; blood. So much blood.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by angering a sitting U.S. Congressman on Facebook — to the extent he challenged me to fight him when he comes to my state (Alaska) next year. I accepted before giving it any thought.,"This all started earlier tonight when I replied to one of his posts, calling him out for frequently lying (as so many politicians are wont to do) and capping it off by calling him a traitor. We then had a brief back and forth and he laid down the challenge. 

He wants us to go at it either in a ring or in a dojo. I told him to message me before he gets here so we can actually make this happen. 

I’m not sure if I’m in over my head or not but I’m not about to back down. I have a surface-level amount of training from my time in the infantry and in law enforcement but he has a similar background. While I highly doubt he will follow through, I better start legitimately training just in case.

Never in a million years did I think he’d respond let alone challenge me to an actual fisticuffs like we’re in the 1800’s but here we are. 

I can provide redacted screenshots in the comments for proof if mods allow it or I can provide them with screenshots if they want to verify. 

TL;DR - I pissed off a sitting U.S. Congressman enough that he challenged me to fight him in 2022 and I accepted.

EDIT: Welp, this blew up. Just woke up. I will read through all comments as time allows today and reply where I can. I just posted a couple of redacted screenshots in the comments. Thanks for the encouragement, fellow Americans and random fellow humans around the world.

EDIT 2: As usual, internet sleuths have figured it out. The congressman is Clay Higgins. Do your thing, internet. Maybe we can find a way to use this to raise money for charity even if he backs down. PR folks, message me. Not sure how to proceed but I’m willing to train and make this happen for a good cause.

EDIT 3: Here’s a quick update: I have had a couple of PR folks and trainers reach out to me and we will see where all of this goes. Realistically, I suspect Clay will continue to ignore all this as numerous people mentioned that is his MO and apparently this isn’t his first time challenging people to a fight on social media. But I will train anyway as it’ll be fun and good for me. For those who were wondering, I was a Republican until around 2012 when I shifted left of center a bit and became an independent. I joined the Democratic Party in 2020. I hope someday the GOP shifts back toward moderate but I won’t hold my breath. We really need more Adam Kinzinger’s in that party. Anyway, it’s going to take *days* to read through these comments and reply to some so bear with me. Thanks for the support.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by making a girl I like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and I almost lost my job.,"So there's this girl I like at work, and we're really good friends. We're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. For some reason I (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""Well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? DAB!"" and promptly did the deed. Also I have ability to cry on demand so I just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

She finds it funny. Extremely funny. So funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. After a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. I asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. Freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, I start to reach for my phone.

And in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. I only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying I think she's having a seizure and I'm calling 911. Fortunately, I was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

Turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. Whoops.

TL;DR. Made I joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. She ended up in the hospital and I almost lost my job.

tifu,TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.,"So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't “work”. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work.

Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.

Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want's to talk” and I want to die.

&#x200B;

obligatory update:

Well, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

I ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.

He had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""Customer\_Commission\_2nd draft.doc""). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

I gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

Like I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU - Posting on Reddit about our sex life with CBAT and now our relationship has ended,"Ok this exploded more than I expected, and has been a bit overwhelming with the messages but thought I’d give an update. 

The attention hasn’t been exactly positive and this hasn’t been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it’s now sadly ended. 

I didn’t expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. 

There aren’t many 25 year old Tyler Life’s who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.

Unfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn’t happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. 

What made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.

Her father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. 

We are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn’t have it and backtracked.

I don’t think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn’t like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn’t force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it’s different. 

I know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I’ll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share. 

TL;DR Made Reddit post and finished our relationship",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by finding a flashdrive and looking what was on it.,"I found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. I put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. It was blurred in the thumbnail, so OF COURSE i have to play it. 

It all happened so fast.

I see a dick. A hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

And then it's cumming.  

And after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and I see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
I just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. This dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

He moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. I'm not going to give it back. I'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. I'm going to burn it with fucking fire. 

TL;DR: I met my siblings today.

tifu,TIFU by letting my son take my wife’s menstrual cup for show and tell,"My wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. Sometime over the weekend I noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it’s versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

Fast forward to this morning and as we’re getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it’s show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. My son looks happy so I figure he’s not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he’s proud of. 

Our conversation:

Teacher: Ben’s show and tell was...interesting. 

Me: Yea! It’s cool right? We’ve been playing with that thing for days. 

Teacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?

I start to panic- oh shit it’s not a toy...

Teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

I get confused. 

Teacher notes my confusion: it’s um, used to collect menstrual blood...

I’m still confused...

Teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

Me: It just...stays in there? 

She nods. 

Me: are you sure? I don’t think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

Teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

We’re both clearly uncomfortable. 

Me: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


My wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

TL:DR thought my wife’s menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

Edit: WOW!!!! I cannot believe this got so much attention. I’m glad everyone got a good laugh. A bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn’t know it was me, though. 

My wife has been reading the comments and insisted that I clarify that I know all about her cycle. We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she’s ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it “fitting” because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I’ve seen a tampon- they’re much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn’t even feel it’s presence after it’s im position. 

I’d like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife’s approval.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by assuming my boyfriend was cheating on me,"This happened when we first started dating.

His mobile used to ping and light up when someone texted him and once I saw that someone had texted him with the name ""Babe ❤️"" I didn't think of it as anything and that I had not seen it correctly but next coming weeks I saw it happening many times. He would get really happy when the person texted, used to smile really big and all. I started thinking I was being cheated on, the last straw for me was when the person texted ""love you too"" I confronted him about and he stared at me for some time before he started laughing.

I cried because what the hell, so he calmed me down and explained to me that Babe is his grandmother, her name is Baberuth and everyone in the family called her Babe, she recently had gotten her first smartphone and he had taught her to text, so when she texted it was exciting for him to see her using emojis and stuff.

Never felt so embarrassed in my life. A few months later he took me to meet her and I kid you not, for a 85 year old Babe is a sport. Seeing her punch a guy square in the jaw for harassing was a sight. We are best friends now.

TL;DR I assumed my boyfriend was cheating on me but it was just his grandmother texting him.

tifu,TIFU by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.,"Well, fuck. 

Not a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. 

TIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That’s right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

Seriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory “not technically today”) but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I’m off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren’t batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here’s the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I’m jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can’t come on my own if my head isn’t under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I’ve only slept for four hours. I’m losing my mind. 

Anyway, at this point I’m abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I’d put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

I’m sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn’t. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I’m bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? 

Once my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I’ve ever done. 

I continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn’t go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of “what the fuck have i done” red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

Now I’ve got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I’ll probably have to cancel. I’ve been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can’t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I’m shit out of luck. 

TL;DR: I masturbated and now I’m
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

EDIT: Sweet baby jesus’s clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn’t stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I’ve never been more grateful for the colloquialism “booty”). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.

EDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I’m bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by buying my wife a sex book,"Our sex life has been pretty boring for the three years we’ve been married. We are both on our second marriage, I’m a widower and she’s divorced. 

My late wife was very very adventurous and her first husband was vanilla missionary or nothing. 

Over lunch yesterday we talked about sex and how it’s become mundane with her admitting that she’s only really ever felt comfortable with “ordinary” sex because that’s all she’s known.  I suggested we get a book for her to read to get an idea of what she might like to try. 

So we went into town to the bookshop and bought a book which she spent the next three hours reading in the bath. 

Come bed time, 9pm unusually, I’m dragged to bed and set upon in very pleasurable way until about an hour in I feel fingers caressing my anus and perineum.  Then a finger followed and to my surprise the one and only vibrator (a small one) we have was pushed inside of me.  Much pleasure was had until my wife gasped and started to sound worried. 

Behind me I felt a lot of fumbling, wife was sounding worried then just stopped and said sorry. I  asked what had happened, the vibe had slipped (been pushed) a little to far and had gone all the way in. 

For the next hour we tried to excrete the thing and finally gave up, still buzzing inside. 

As we’d both had a drink a taxi was booked and a trip to A&E was made.  

It took only a few minutes with a speculum, lube and forceps to remove the then quiet vibe from me and after promising to be more careful in future we returned home. 

This morning I skipped my normal bike ride and have sat gingerly at my desk. 

Wife just wandered in and wondered if I’d like to get a bigger vibe so it doesn’t get stuck.  I don’t know what I’ve awakened. 

Tldr: bought wife a sex book and ended up in a&e with vibe stuck in my anus.

tifu,TIFU by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think I was a heroin junkie,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I’d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I’ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200B;

This progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady’s second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...

Fast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I’d spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200B;

So I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn’t enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked “why are you buying all of these boxes of staples”. But I brushed it off as a work issue that I’d get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.

&#x200B;

Over the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn’t know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200B;

This past Thursday after one of my “late nights” I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.

&#x200B;

My wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying “what are you talking about” until my mom said “honey, we saw the pictures”. Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me “do something” with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was

&#x200B;

""I...I like staples.""

&#x200B;

The WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn’t laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a “staple hour” once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people’s perspectives on my problem.

1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.

2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn’t think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn’t think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by using a nose hair trimmer to manscape my nether regions (and subsequently revealing mankind's most horrible secret on Reddit),"As preface to this TIFU I am commiting one of the greatest societal taboos and revealing a secret that heretofore has been zealously guarded throughout the ages. It is a correlate to childbirth in that just as post-menopausal women wouldn't dare tell an expectant mother how truly agonizing childbirth is, no man in his 50s would traumatize a man in his youthful prime with fears of the anatomical horror that is to come. But times have changed and new technology places men in grave danger, so now you must know of this biological atrocity, in order that you might avoid my disastrous FU....  
Sometime around midlife, men's hair follicles undergo a revolting mutation. While hair atop one's head thins and drops, new hair grows in places you never imagined. Bristle-stiff tufts sprout outside and inside of ears, and up nostrils. Eyebrows become bushy, unruly and coarse. Pubic hair turns gray and scraggly (I shit you not). All these hairs grow alarming fast and require constant attention, lest you become that guy with a bunny paw sticking out of his ear. Their eradication is a battle men wage stoically and silently through the second half of their lives. And, as with any battle, there are casualties. Now, onto my TIFU.

I found a great nose hair trimmer in the As Advertised On TV aisle at CVS. It looks like and operates like a minature hedge trimmer. It's virtually impossible to cut yourself but mows down the hair.

Yesterday I was trimming ear, nose and eyebrow hairs after a shower. I was so happy with the results that I decided to try it on my pubes too. It worked great! Soon I had gone a bit overboard and pretty much shaved my balls and the base of the shaft to the skin. I liked the new look, but my bushy taint was a testicular neck beard that had to go.

I positioned a make up mirror on the bathroom floor and laid down spread eagle, knees up, so I could see and trim everything well. Where once just a few wispy hairs prevailed, unbeknownst to me a virtual forest had arisen! Worst of all, my butthole was sporting Borat mustache assbrows. Trusty new nose hair trimmer in hand, I prepared for battle. 

The assbrows had to go first. I began on the left and quickly decimated the bunghole caterpillar. I moved decisively to the right, prepared to take down assbrow two with one swift stroke close to the skin. However, this was not to be. Instead, my ass hairs wrapped around the trimmer blade like Rappunzel using a superheated curling iron, pulling the device tight against my skin and jamming the blade. The hairs were being ripped from my flesh and the pain was excruciating. No matter how I tried, I couldn't remove the trimmer. Wiggling it  tugged the hairs more; restarting it was a double down that I lost - the hairs were wound even tighter against the blade.

I frog walked naked to my bedroom, one hand holding the trimmer tied between my butt cheeks, and searched for my cuticle scissors. No luck. I did however find a carpet knife. Unbearable pain breeds desperation. Back on the bathroom floor, I tried in vain to cut myself free, nicking the tenderest of flesh twice and drawing the first blood of battle. I was making little progress and it was time to make the ultimate sacrifice. After a suitable prayer, I gripped tight on the trimmer and committed reverse harakiri, Brazilian wax style, ripping off the trimmer blade along with its assbrow net trap. Blinding pain left me curled fetal, hyperventilating, while blood slowly trickled down my ass crack.

I decided to share my TIFU and expose life's cruel secret in the best interest of mankind, that others may avoid falling prey to the technological wonders of As Seen on TV hair removal tools. Young men of Reddit, I beg of you to heed my warning. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

TL;DR used nose hair trimmer on bunghole brows, tore myself a new one.

Edit:. I was pretty sure this TIFU would be popular but I'm genuinely blown away. 57,000 upvotes in a day!?!  54 awards!?!  My post in the same league as the coconut and poop knife!?!?!?!
 So humbling. Thank you. 
Many of you complimented my writing, and you have no idea how much that means to me.  I toiled as a construction industry technical editor for decades. I am writing a book but I've stalled several times. Your compliments are giving me inspiration to pick it up again.

tifu,TIFU by asking my parents when they fucked,"
No, not clickbait, this is word for word what happened. Obligatory didn’t happen today, but I’ve never told anyone this story so I figured I should before I die.

So when I was about 7, my parents took me and my little sister to the park, as parents do. Someone had graffitied the slide with the word “fuck” and being the curious kid I was, asked my dad what it meant.

I hadn’t had the “birds and the bees” talk yet, so my dad figured this was an appropriate time to do so. He goes through the basic idea, man puts peepee in woman and she has a baby grow in her tummy. That’s what the word meant! Too bad he forgot to tell me that it was a swear and NOT the proper term for the act.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, my parents sat me down and revealed that my mom was going to have another baby. I was confused. Don’t two people have to fuck to make a baby? I certainly never saw my parents do such a thing. So I had to ask.

“When did you fuck?”

Obviously my mother lost it and demanded I tell her who taught me that word, whether it was one of the neighborhood kids or someone from school. I told her dad taught me. 

Needless to say, my dad probably didn’t get another fuck for a while after that.

TL;DR: Dad told me what “fuck” meant but forgot to tell me I shouldn’t say it; ended up asking mom why I never saw them make a baby in the most inappropriate way possible",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99,"Throwaway account.

We've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. 

Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. 

For the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. 

I feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life

TLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

tifu,Tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic,"So this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  She called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. I started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if I took a picture. To be funny I included my man parts in the photograph.  When she got home, I asked her how she liked the picture I had sent. She seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what I was talking about.

tifu,TIFU by not realizing the cute gym employee thinks I'm a transwoman.,"Where to start...ever since the covid lock-down happened I have been letting my hair grow out. At first it was because all the barber shops were closed but then even after I got my hands on a hair clipper it became more amusing to see how far I could take this. Covid had put a stop to my dating life so I wasn't trying to clean up for anyone. So after a year of letting my hair grow out it is now shoulder length.

Another side effect of covid is my weight. I used to go to the gym regularly but stopped once the gyms were closed due to covid. I have never been the type to run on the streets so my weight gained the covid 25 akin to the proverbial freshman 15. I have a pretty skinny frame to begin with so what that means is that all the fat went to my stomach and my now ""man boobs"".

There is just one last piece of information before I can start. I am the type of Asian that has trouble growing facial hair. 

So now we can begin. As most of you know, we are reaching the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of covid. Most states are relaxing their lockdown restrictions and my gym finally reopened last week. Eager to get back into shape, I went on the first day of the reopening. I do my thing on the machines and maybe pushed myself a little too hard or perhaps I am just that out of shape because I was a complete mess by the end of my workout. I make my way toward the men's room but this cute gym employee who was sanitizing the water fountain in between the men's and women's room intercepted me. She said ""you can use that one"" pointing to the women's room and in my exhausted and muscle already starting to ache state, I only thought perhaps there was something wrong with the men's room and that they closed it off. So I go in the women's room (it was empty because the gym just reopened) and I take care of business. When I come out, she said ""I think what you're doing is brave"" and I for some reason thought she meant going to the gym again and said thanks. It wasn't until I got to my car that the light bulb in my head finally turned on - she must think I'm a transwoman. The long hair, man boobs and no facial hair.

Now it wouldn't be so bad if that was the only interaction I have with her but the next day she came over as I was running on the treadmill to introduce herself. And because I have been going to the gym almost everyday (since I'm serious about getting back into shape) she and I have developed a sort of friendship. Just today she asked how long I have been transitioning and I said since covid. I don't know how long I can keep this up for... this is the cheapest gym in my area so I don't want to switch.

TLDR; Gained long hair and moobs during covid. Gym finally reopened and cute employee thinks I'm a transwoman.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU By being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. NSFW,"Well, this didn't happen today. But it's a funny story that I couldn't share with reddit at the time.

Rewind back to me at 14 years old. Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

As such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

One night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had ""homework"" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

So I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

Now this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

You see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. 

The desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.

But what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

I also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

I eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

And that's when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

So I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

No one ever brought it up. And I'm thankful. But I know what they saw. And I'm still cringing.

Tl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.

Edit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

tifu,TIFU by paying $70 for a $29 haircut,"I went and got a $29 haircut.  $29 after tax.  I went to pay with my card, stuck it in, then remembered I had cash, so I clicked decline on the card reader, and then went to pay with cash instead, all while conversing with the woman who just cut my hair.   I hand her $40 and she looks shocked.  I said ""I don't need change""   She said ""ohmygosh...are you sure?"". I'm like ""yeah!"" She asks me again ""oh my gosh are you serious? Seriously?"". I was like ""yes!"" And she's like ""thank you so so much.  This is literally going to buy me and my kids dinner"" and I was like jeeze she must get bad tips...I start to walk away and she goes ""Oh actually your card transaction timed out!  You need to reinsert it.  It didn't go through."" At which point I realized she had no idea I meant to pay for all of it with cash and thought I was giving her a $40 cash tip for a $29 haircut.

tifu,TIFU for not shitting for a month.,"Obligatory 'this didn't actually happen today', etc. 


So when I was 14 I got into a huge fight with my mother and she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle. It was an incredibly stressful event, and combined with my innate shyness about pooping anywhere but at home, at first I didn't notice that I wasn't pooping. After about two weeks I began to feel awful and tried, without success, to shit. It had built up so much that I think it was impacted. To top it off, my aunt and uncle were weird about bathroom stuff (partly due to having one bathroom in a household of 5 people) and twice while trying to force it they knocked on the door and asked what was taking so long, which made the whole thing worse. 


I didn't tell anyone, partly out of embarrassment and partly out of fear of getting in trouble. (They were strict and I did get in trouble for random things). Another very uncomfortable 2 weeks passed, until one day, a month to the day that I had first arrived and the last time I had pooped, I was sent out to rake some leaves and I was just in total agony. I went back inside and told my aunt what was going on. She was thankfully very understanding (although incredulous that I had waited so long to tell her) and told me she'd had poop issues her whole life. She went out and got me laxatives, suppositories and a fleet enema and showed me how to use it. At this point I was in so much pain and just sweating bullets and dying for relief. 


The remedies barely helped matters, but in an hour or so I hopped on the toilet and tried to make things happen. 


I put both hands on the walls and pushed with all my force, knees up to my chin, straining with all my might. I've since given birth and I pushed harder during this shit than I did pushing out my son. It hurt *so bad* and I felt I was straining every muscle in my body to void this beast. After 10 or so horrifying minutes I still wasn't having any luck, and I began wondering if I should ask to go to the hospital, but the idea of a doctor digging shit out of my asshole way just too much to bear, so I pressed on. After 15-20 agonizing minutes, grunting and straining and thrashing and pleading with my ass to cooperate, finally, finally, I heard my first heavy *plop*. Oh thank God! I cried from the pain and shock and relief. The first foot or so of poop wasn't much easier, it was so hard and dry. I had to twist and strain for awhile, but after that it got a bit easier. About 30 minutes in I stood up and looked into the bowl. Have you ever had a shit so large, so complete that it entirely filled the rim of the toilet, halfway up the bowl rising above the water in thick brown and black coils, iced with a significant amount of blood? I have. I have never and I mean never seen a pile of human shit like that and hope never to again. I would say about 3-4kg of shit. About the size of a large round birthday cake.


I flushed once, twice, plunged, and got back on the toilet for round 2. It just kept coming. This part was significantly easier, despite the fact that my ass had torn a little in the process of round 1. Round 2 was about 3/4 of the size of round 1. Finally, the flood stopped, and I gingerly wiped, flushed, cleaned the toilet and emerged from the bathroom a changed person. I ached inside for a few days after but oh my god the relief was incredible. I'll never forget that day as long as I live.

tifu,TIFU by punching my son in the face as hard as I possibly could,"So my son moved back in with me because of the pandemic (he had to take a pay cut.) This isn't really an issue because we get along great and I raised him alone. I also have a big enough house that he he has more of his own space. I'm 43, he's 24.

My basement is a makeshift boxing gym. I have some free weights, punching bags, and boxing gloves, among other things. So when my son moved back in we both decided this could be a fun way to stay in shape and bond. We practice a few times a week.

Yesterday, we were sparring (no holds barred but we were wearing boxing headgear) and I guess I didn't wrap my glove tightly enough, because it fell off and I didn't notice and neither did my son. 

So I go to punch, he gives me this deer-in-the-headlights look, like OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and then I punched him, bare knuckled, in the face, without holding back.

He has a broken nose. I have two broken fingers.

TL;DR: Absolutely lit my son's shit up with a full-strength punch and now we're both out of commission for a few weeks. Also, I bought new boxing gloves. And duct tape. I still feel bad but he isn't upset, and we've been laughing telling other people the story.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by kissing my deaf Friend,"Hi there. (22M)

I'll try to keep it short.

I met a girl through a mutual friend. We've known eachother for roughly a year, but haven't spend time alone yet, always in a group. She's very sweet and pretty.

She's not completly deaf , she can still hear a bit, with the help of hearing aids.

I guess  mild deafness, not sure tho?.

Yesterday we met up with our mutual friends, we were having a barbecue. Later on, we ran out of snacks, so the other two went to the grocery store

&#x200B;

We were alone in the yard, chatting etc.

Now I noticed that she kept staring at my lips, so I thought to myself does she want to kiss me?.

Since she didn't stop staring I thought, that it's obvious. This time I'm not going to miss a hint.

I leaned in to give her a kiss, I mean she did kinda kiss me back, but afterwards it was like dead silence.  Thank God the other two arrived a few minutes later.

The rest of the evening was super akward between us. Later as she left, I told the other two friends that I had kissed her because she kept staring at my lips.

They started laughing saying Of course she's staring at your lips , she's lipreading.!

Man, I totally forgot that deaf people also use lipreading to communicate, and since she's never actually done that before I didn't take that into consideration

This will definitly be one of the moments that'll make me stay up at night and cringe, plus I probably ruined the friendship.

TL;DR by thinking my friend wanted to kiss me, she probably didn't.


UPDATE:  Okay, Guys I sent her a message, asking if she wants to come over.

She said she'll be here in an hour.

I'm nervous lol, I'm trying to convince my roomate to go on a long walk.


Update 2:

Sorry that you guys had to wait that long. 
She just left 5 minutes ago.

I didn't tell her beforehand, that I wanted to talk to her about the kiss, so it was a bit akward approaching the topic.
 I can't go into full detail now, but I told her that I didn't mean to make her feel uncomftable and that I had misread the signs. 
We had a good laugh. 
Afterwards I asked her If she'd be down to maybe try things out if she's interested.

The thing is, she's going to move to Munich, Germany in a few months (end of march) (I live in France) and she told me that, while she does like me, she didn't plan on making any romantic interest, because she doesn't want to get too attached, due to her moving away anyways. 

 She admitted to liking me alot and would like to give it a shot despite the circumstances ,  but only under the condition that I am being serious about it, since she doesn't want something that's only casual.

We're going on a date on Tuesday, and we'll just see if it works out between us.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by giving my dog his allergy pills for 3 years in peanut butter,"I have a 5 year old dog, had him since he was 3 months old. Love him to death, he's an amazingly playful dog (Jack Russell).

A few years ago, he started developing really itchy red skin on his toes, and the poor pup would constantly lick his toes to the point where he was making them almost hairless. Took him to the vet, they said it was allergies, and prescribed him medication ($60 a month!). We've been buying this medication for him ever since, occasionally skipping a few weeks and using a mini-dose of Benadryl until we purchased more allergy pills. The pills helped, as in he wasn't constantly licking his toes all the time, but he would still lick them so it wasn't a surefire solution. Let's say 80% cure.

Now, on to the fuckup. We tried giving him the pills with nothing, and he just puts them in his mouth and spits them out. So, we started putting them in a little bit of peanut butter, which he licks off a spoon (and the pill gets swallowed along with the PB).

A few weeks ago we ran out of peanut butter, so we used jello instead. It worked just as well because he swallowed it right up. Over the next few days we did the same thing, and he wasn't licking his toes AT ALL. Lightbulb...we took our dog to the vet to get an allergy test (which we should have done FROM THE START).

**Test Result:** Dog is allergic to peanut butter. We've been giving him his allergy pills dipped in the substance he's allergic to.

He's a happy dog now with no more itchy toes!

My name isn’t Brian, but before I could correct her I remembered reading something online that said “if a girl ever pretends to know you, play along, she might be in trouble”. So I played along and started having a friendly chat with her as if I knew her. Well, not long into the conversation she looks at me and goes “wait, you’re not Brian”. To which I respond, “I know, I thought we were doing a thing”. Then a bit louder and annoyed she says “why would you pretend to be someone I know?!” Now the guy she was with before comes over and asks if everything is alright.

Knowing I had fucked up, I just told them honestly what I was doing. Turns out he was her boyfriend and he was talking about fantasy baseball, that’s why she was so disinterested. She found it funny and thanked me even though I read the situation wrong. He was kinda offended but understood. I have never been more embarrassed.

TLDR Some girl mistook me for her friend, so I pretended to be him because I thought she was trying to use me to get out of a conversation with a creepy guy who turned out to be her boyfriend and she just actually thought I was a different person.

EDIT: hey, thanks for the awards! And I’ll proudly rock my new title as Brian due to this encounter.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by helping my cat kill a moth,"Ever since he was a kitten, my cat and I had come to an understanding.  Let me explain. My cat generally doesn't like being picked up. However, one time, six years ago, a moth flew into my house. My cat wanted to kill it, but he couldn't reach it. I don't know how I got the idea, but I picked him up to help him reach it. At first, he squirmed, then when he realized he could reach the moth, he forgot about me and proceeded to murder the moth.  Afterwards, I'd put him down, give him a treat and a couple pets. And from then on, we had pact. When a moth, spider, or some other bug was out of reach, I'd pick him up and my cat would kill it. Truly a win-win situation.

Fast forward six years to today. A moth flew into my bedroom. Just as I get up to kill it, I see my cat staring intensely at it. He's got this determined, adorable, murderous look on his face. As I'm looking at him, he turns to me and I can almost see the pleading in his eyes, ""Please, I got this."" 

""Okay,"" I respond. I pick him up and he starts waving his paws in what are several failed attempts at catching the moth (wtf boy? Maybe a little rusty at this). Then, in what can only be described a 400 IQ move, the moth flies directly at my cat. My cat panics and flails everywhere. I scream and drop him from about 7 ft up (he's fine). Pain.  There is only pain.  I look at my [arm](https://i.imgur.com/3fDLYDo.jpg).  In the moment, I have no idea how bad it is, so I just rush to the bathroom to disinfect my arm. Fortunately, it's not that bad. It just stings whenever I move left arm or hand.

I walk back to my room and see the fucker just [laying there](https://i.imgur.com/jM1Ht43.jpg). ""You see [this](https://i.imgur.com/44Eyq8v.jpg) shit?"" I asked him. He sniffed it a bit and just kind of looked unconcerned. ""Meh, just a minor flesh wound. Didn't even rupture an artery. My claws must be dull. I mean, that looks bad."" 

I go back into my room and see the moth there. I go to kill it and my cat makes this weird trilling sound. He's staring intensely at the moth eyes filled with murder lust. He looks at me for permission.  This time, I killed the moth. 

tl;dr: cat broke our murder pact. probably should never have formed one with a cat anyway.",Entertainment
tifu,"TIFU by misinterpreting the CEO's arm gesture in a job interview, and then locking arms with him as if we were Best Friends 4Ever.","UPDATE 3: I got the job!
UPDATE 2: Third interview is in a weeks time! This is dragging on, sorry :)
UPDATE: OH MY WORD! I've been invited to the second round of interviews! 

Obligatory; this happened yesterday. The memory still makes me cringe. And cry. I had a job interview with a CEO, in person, despite COVID. I was super nervous, as per usual. Maybe even more than usual, because I really wanted this job. I tried to calm myself down but by the time the interviewer showed up I could literally feel my heartbeat in my throat. He (50ish/M) walked down the stairs towards me, in his nice suit, but stopped halfway down. I figured the interview would take place upstairs, so I got up to meet him. And as I was walking up the stairs towards him, he put his arm up.. and his elbow out. And my brain just sort of went ‘ERRORRR!’.

I suppose it could have only meant two things. It could have meant (A) ‘Please take my arm, milady, so I can escort you to the room as if we’re strolling down the promenade together’, or (B) ‘Please give me an *elbow bump*, since we can’t shake hands’, which is *really* not an uncommon gesture at all in the Netherlands.
So what did I do? Yes, I went with option A and I eagerly locked arms with this strange man that I’d never met before in my life, as if saying ‘yes, good sir, let’s go for that stroll’.

And then we just stood there! Arm in arm, halfway up the stairs, sheepishly staring at each other. I wanted the earth to swallow me whole. I just didn’t know what to do next and I don’t think he’d fully understood what’d happened, so neither of us moved.

When he’d finally gathered his senses, he said ‘I eh.. meant to give you an elbow-bump?’, after which I quickly put as much distance between us as I could and mumbled ‘Right! Right, yes, that makes much more sense’. Because it did, let's face it.

And then we had the interview.

TL;DR I got so nervous that I misjudged the CEO's arm gesture during a job interview, and locked arms with him as if we were Best Friends 4Ever.

Why am I like this?

tifu,TIFU I am never fucking touching a Nintendo switch ever again,"So my family usually opens presents Christmas morning around 8am, but due to my mother working this year we had to start at 6:30.(I know, it is as horrible as it sounds). Now, my brother and I are of age and old enough to understand the santa process. However, we have a younger sister who still fully believes. She did the list, put out the cookies, yadayada.

The main thing she wanted this Christmas (and last year) was a Nintendo switch. I don’t know much about it other than it’s expensive and could make a child’s Christmas wish come true. 

So it comes midnight and My mother and I are wrapping up the presents for everyone and checking off the list to make sure nothing was forgotten. (Everyone else is asleep). But then we come across the Nintendo. 

My mom asks me where it is, I have no fucking clue. I go up and ask my dad, he has no fucking clue. Everyone in my family, no.fucking.clue.

We all begin scrounging the house, top to fucking bottom. Every corner, every drawer, every hiding spot. Even the fucking vents????? 

Time passes, we’re still looking, it’s 2 in the morning. We should’ve been asleep an hour ago.  My mother has to wake up in 4 hours to get ready for a full day of work and be with us for presents. She’s crying, my dads pissed, I’m nervous. 

I send my parents up to bed and tell them to leave it up to me. (Still don’t know why the fuck I said this). So I stay up, still looking. It’s now 4am. I’m ready to pass out. 

I decide to write the letter from santa myself. Stating the following. “Dear ______, ...... I hit a major storm in the middle of the night and lost Dasher and 60% of my presents!! Expect a delivery from the elves within the next few days!” 

So I’m looking up what stores I can buy this fucking Nintendo switch again, of course they’re all closed at 4am but they’re closed all day for Christmas too. Now I’m fucking buggin

I decide to let the note do it’s magic, and pray I can find a Nintendo switch to buy AGAIN. 

Christmas morning comes along, she reads the note, she’s freaking out that santa even made it in such a bad storm. But she’s also freaking out that Dasher is on the loose. I try to calm her down and she keeps screaming that santa can’t fly without all his reindeer and is probably “missing”. (If you’ve ever seen Christmas chronicles, she hit it spot on) 

Finally we open the fucking rest of the presents. 
WE LEFT THE FUCKING SWITCH GAME WRAPPED AND SHE OPENED IT. Gave it the fuck away instantly. Now I’m frustrated as fuck that we were so unprepared. This is supposed to be “huge”.

We finish up presents, my mom goes to work, my sister is playing with her stuff and I’m checking out my new bling. 

I then remember that my polish for jewelry was in the trunk of the car. (I don’t know why, don’t ask) 

I open up the fucking trunk, and there it is. THE NINTENDO FUCKING SWITCH. SITTING RIGHT THERE. STARING AT ME. I start crying tears of joy. I don’t have to spend another 300 on a fucking console and games. 

I wrap it instantly and leave it on the front bench. 
I go upstairs, play a hoofing sounds of a horse from my speaker, and make a loud bang. 

“WHAT WAS THAT” -my sister 

“I don’t know, it sounded like it came from outside. Want me to check?” -me 

“SIS. ITS DASHER. IT HAS TO BE. HE HAS IT.” 

She runs as fast as I’ve ever seen her run down the stairs and whips the door open. Before even seeing the present on the bench, she goes to look at the roof to see if dasher is there. Lol. Finally, she falls upon the gift wrapped up on the bench.  

She grabs it, runs inside, opens it, cries.

“Santa really does listen.” -my sister 

And then I cried. Again. Because I was so relieved it was over. 

All in all, She was happy, I was happy, my parents pissed they left it somewhere so stupid, and Christmas was even more fun for my sister.

I am never fucking touching a Nintendo switch ever again. 

Edit: I understand people are commenting that they believe this is a made up story. I wish it was. I did not plan nor enjoy going through the stress at first but at the end it was all worth it. I’m the oldest sister of this family and believe it’s important to keep her belief going. It brings our family joy to see her so excited for Santa. 

This is literally my first time posting on Reddit, and I had no clue it would blow up like this. I read them with my boyfriend all the time (specifically this community) and decided this story was worth a share. Thanks to everyone who has sent Christmas wishes. God bless you all and Merry Christmas. 

TL:DR we lost my sisters most wanted Xmas present, lost our fucking minds looking for it, and it ended up being in the fucking car trunk.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by leaving THC chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles,"My cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of THC chocolate for Christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. My parents are 75-year old Republicans. That was a big maybe.

&#x200B;

Well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. You put half a candy bar down and YOINK, gone when you come back.

&#x200B;

You can guess what happened. My mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. Her last words, high as a kite, were ""I think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200B;

They took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. At which point I assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the RedBull Orbit Jumper.

&#x200B;

Anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. So now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

&#x200B;

Obligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I'm in Canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but I'm planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)

Second update from my dad: Mom's surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.

FP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I'm headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

UPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

Check out my adorable mom

tifu,TIFU by saying I was tired to my wife.,"Came home from the gym. Its leg day. Had full day at work too. Work isn't bad. Came home to happy kids. Wife does a great job at keeping them alive. The best. Had to take a shower before bed. Wife says hurry because shes tired. I empathize by saying I will hurry because I am also tired. Bad idea. Wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. I do not dispute this since I am not a total moron. Kids are exhausting but totally worth it. I tell her as much. She is most tired. I am only kind of tired. Not good enough. She is more tired. I agree with this in order to ease the tension. Unsuccessful. She is fully triggered by the fact that I had the audacity to say that I was tired. There is no escape. Am screwed. 


Tldr: am not allowed to be tired. Ever.

Edit: wow. That's a lot of comments and stuff. Thanks, reddit. This weekend I will celebrate with a nap! Cheers! What makes this cool is that I wrote it while pooping before bed. Cant wait to tell my wife!

tifu,TIFU by reading my girlfriend the TIFU about a mother telling her child that Bob Ross is dead,"**- This story is faked to show you that people shouldn't believe everything they read on the internet -**

I was reading this TIFU post about a mother who told her 4 year old that her hero Bob Ross is dead. One part got me in a fit and naturally my girlfriend asked me what made me laugh, so i started explaining the story in short.

As soon as I told her the kid had to cry because she had just been told Bob was dead, all colour left her face. With tears in her eyes and a pouting lip she asked me if I was serious - I explained to her that Bob Ross had in fact died in 1995, showing her the Wikipedia page to corroborate it.

My girlfriend is up there on the cries-because-swans-can-be-gay spectrum, so surprising here with this fact was not a smart move. The weeping waned away, but the sad and defeated mood stayed and now I'm on my way to pick up a bottle of wine and a tub of ice cream,so we can enjoy that during a Bob Ross paint-along.

I guess it'll be a watercolour made with tears. Thanks, /u/garryoak

tifu,TIFU by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.,"Tomorrow I'll be turning 32.  As we were waking up this morning she asked me if I was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. I responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but I was looking forward to it nonetheless.

She looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. I thought she was just trying to make sense of what I had said. Instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that I ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. I didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

It took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. Unfortunately for her I've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

TL ; DR

Made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. Oops.

EDIT: I'm honestly surprised that I have to say this, but this was all in good fun. My wife is fucking awesome and probably one of the chillest, low-maintenance people I've ever known.

tifu,TIFU by not taking a second to think after my son came out to me,"My husband and I have always had an inkling that our son was on the LGBTQ spectrum. My son coming out to me was not a shock in the grand scheme of things.

I went up to my son’s room to ask what he wanted for dinner. I knocked and went in. I was tired after work and things weren’t really registering. He just said “Mom, I’m gay.”

For some reason it just didn’t register that he had just told me something so major for him. I don’t know what part of my brain thought this was a good idea, but I just said, “ok, do you want pizza for dinner?” 

It took a few minutes for me to realize what I said and that I did not react properly. I went back to him and apologized and gave him the whole “I love you just the same” spiel and we laughed about my reaction, but I’m still SO embarrassed and mad at myself. Definitely wasn’t the way I had always planned to respond!

tifu,TIFU by mistakenly believing exercise turns you on for nearly thirty years.,"So this is going to need some context so I look like less of an idiot (though I thoroughly assure you I'm an idiot).

Ten minutes ago I found out. Ten goddamn minutes ago, I found out that a worldview I've held my entire life is, in fact, not true, and apparently I'm just a weirdo.

You see, whenever I exercise, something goes haywire in my brain that spikes my libido to something ridiculous. Think Jekyll and Hyde. That's weird for me to type, because my entire life I thought that was *everyone.* I legitimately thought that was just a common thing: people exercise, and as a result get turned on.

And you know what, in my defense how could I not. What are workout ads if not ""grr sweat lookat this sweaty sexy body grr,"" and like 30% of all porn involving women in their 30's (which is like 90% of my porn) can be summed up with ""hey you know what goes great with pilates? penis."" I thought you people were like me, who legitimately got turned on through exercise, because why else would you advertise it like that and have so many euphemisms? Dafuq is wrong with you? But apparently I was just dropped on my head too many times as a child or something.

Fuck. Now this is a FUCK UP because as I'm typing this in real time, I'm remembering all the times in my life I've tried to incorporate cardio into foreplay. No, you idiot, not like ""hur dur lets do planks in bed before we blast our triceps,"" but christ, ugh this hurts so damn much to type now that I know it's *all a lie* but shit like getting bootycalls and responding with shit like ""mhm lemme do a quick workout first"" OH GOD I'm realizing how fucking stupid that is if there's no context WHY DIDNT ANY OF YOU TELL ME THIS. I THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD AND WAS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH BUT INSTEAD I WAS THE FUCKING FOOL WHO WAS DOING SQUATS IN THE GYM BEFORE SEX. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I DID THAT SHIT THINKING THEY WORKED THE SAME WAY AND EXERCISE ALSO GOT THE BLOOD FLOWING AND WAS THE MOTHER OF APHRODISIACS AND

Oh god. Oh god oh FUCK. ink;efwerioj'ewij'oderwo'ijerfij'eruhotrijepr I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK OUT BEFORE TOO. Oh my good Jesus Christ I

I can't believe I did that. Oh my god save me I didn't know. I LITERALLY TOLD GIRLS I WAS WITH, thinking in my STUPID BRAIN, my STUPID STUPID BRAIN, that it would be hot if they worked out beforehand. *I told them they should work out more.*

What the fuck was I doing I'm literally melting in horror here right now. I'm remembering it all; I literally thought it would do the same thing to them as it did to me, make the sex better, make everything better, but instead, INFUCKINGSTEAD I'm the goddamn JACKASS who probably came across as 'HUR DUR TONE UR ABS BEFORE HAVING SEX WITH ME' or some nightmarish nonsense. Like some hellish dudebro straight from the bowels of the foulest yacht club fraternity. FUCK. How the FUCK did they put up with that. How the FUCK do I apologize for that, because what the fuck am I going to do just call them up and be like ""hehe hey yeah Angie I know it's been five years since we've talked and I know you're in a lovely relationship but I wanted to tell you those times I tried to get us to go on a jog before sex wasn't because I thought you were fat but because apparently something's wrong with my brain.""

No. No, I can't do that, I have to live with that. For the rest of my life, my goddamn life I have to live with that. Why didn't you tell me. Why didn't any of you tell me. All the 'workout euphemisms' I've used with girlfriends. Oh god their blank stares make sense now. Fifteen years of dating, fifteen years of blank stares. It all makes sense now. It all makes sense.

Oh god. oh fuck.

TL;DR

Christ. Something is odd with my brain in that exercise of any form spikes my libido, and from workout ads, euphemisms, etc, I believed everyone on earth worked the same way. So I've incorporated that into my relationships and flings, like a goddamn idiot, my entire life, much to their confusion. No one corrected me. Found out just now that no, it doesn't work like that.

*Edit: I’ll respond to these comments later, I’ve got some... apologies to make first. Not sure how I’m going to go about “I’m sorry that I made us jog before sex” sound sincere, but I’ll think of something.*  


*Update: Apologized to an ex I'm still close with about this, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. Apparently she just thought I was 'super into my body,' like an egomaniac. Which is...... better? I dunno, glad I closed that up but don't think I'll message the exes I'm not on good terms with; that would be too dumb to just casually bring up after five years of not talking.* ",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by making my one-night stand breakfast.,"I got out of a bad relationship a few months ago and only recently felt good enough to get out of the house again. This was my first-ever boyfriend and he turned out to be a piece of crap, so I was obviously a bit hesitant. But some old friends from high school were visiting my town and asked if I wanted to go on a bar crawl with them and I figured fuck it, it's not like anything will happen (other than getting drunk with some pals), so why not? 

At the first bar we run into a group of guys from my University. I had seen some of them around but never spoke to them before. One of my friends decides she's going to force me to ""get out of my shell"" and drags our group over to talk with them. I'm EXTREMELY quiet (like... weirdly quiet to most people) so I end up sitting in the corner of our booth and not saying anything, just drinking and feeling awkward. Well, one of the guys in the other group (let's call him Adam) is also being weirdly quiet. So my friends and his friends, who are already tipsy, decide to make things as awkward as possible by making us play truth or dare--except we have to drink when we don't want to answer something. 

There are a lot of personal/sexual questions neither of us want to answer, so we end up drinking quite a bit. And by the time we're done the first bar, Adam and I are on a whole different plane of existence from everyone else. And it turned out we had a lot in common, and he was pretty cute, and we're goofing around and laughing the whole time. I started to get butterflies in my stomach, and not just from the alcohol. Adam has my exact sense of humour and is really sweet and kind. We wander off and start having deep drunk conversations about feeling left out of things and how annoying it is when people say shit like ""Can they speak?"" I tell him I'm walking home and he offers to walk with me. I know where this is going but I'm drunk enough that I don't feel nervous, plus I feel like I have a genuine connection with this guy. Our friends are wolf-whistling as we leave and instead of being embarassed, I feel weirdly proud. 

So we get to my place, talk and smoke for a bit, and do the deed. I wake up earlier than him and decide I'm going to make a nice breakfast. I want to impress him and show him I like him, and everyone likes a good breakfast when they have a hangover, right? So I sneak out of bed and make scrambled eggs, french toast, and sausage. I prefer almond milk so I use that for the eggs and french toast. He wakes up and tells me I look just as cute sober. At this point I'm convinced he's the love of my life. He sees the breakfast and gets excited and I'm like yes! My plan worked! I'm going to get to his heart through his stomach! 

We eat and everything's going great for a few bites. Then he makes a weird face and clears his throat. His eyes start to widen and he asks me what if there were nuts in the bread or something. I say no, but I used almond milk. He jumps out of his chair and says ""CALL AN AMBULANCE RIGHT. NOW."" I'm freaking the fuck out. He's wheezing and stuff and looks absolutely panicked. I ask if he has an epipen and he shakes his head no. So I call an ambulance and tell them he's having an allergic reaction and paramedics come and haul him off. 

This happened last weekend. I have not heard back from him since. I found his buddy and confirmed he is not dead. I guess accidentally triggering a severe allergic reaction does not lead to romance. 

TL;DR: Tried to impress my romantic interest by cooking for him. He went into anaphylaxis and no longer wants to speak to me.",Entertainment
tifu,TIFU by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend,"I have grapheme-color synesthesia. Basically I see letters and numbers in colors. The letter 'E' being green for example. A couple months ago I was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. He asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. Since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what I said a few months ago. Always being the sameish as course. He still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe I just memeroized them really really well.

Tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head. I asked him what colour are the letters in his head. He looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

My boyfriend didnt understand what I meant by visualizing the letters. He didn't believe me that I can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

Turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. When he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. He can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. He thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... Its crazy to him the fact that I can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

Now I have a boyfriend that is really upset. He feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. He's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing I wasnt pulling his chain. Hes pretty upset and I feel really bad. 

Tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (Cant visualize anything at all)

Edit; Oh wow this blew up. I just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. He never thought I was lying. I think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",Entertainment

So 5 month ago I met a girl though mutual friend, first she added me on social media we talked for a bit and then exchanged numbers. About a week later we went on a date, it went well.

Sometimes she would come over to place and stay for a day or two. 
So, around 2 weeks ago she said she wasnt feeling okay and she needed some time alone. I said sure and did not really say anything. Yesterday she messaged me we talked for a bit and she said she was now feeling better. I asked her why she wasnt feeling okay she said it was because she broke up with her boyfriend.

We are creating a megathread for discussion of this topic here. The typical /r/science comment rules will not apply and we will allow mature, open discussion. This post may be updated as we are able.

science,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.
